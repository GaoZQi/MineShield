By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has confirmed that the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Forrest Sherman seized a shipment of guided missile components of suspected Iranian origin last week that appeared to be heading for Houthi rebels in Yemen. This comes amid reports of possible new threats from Iran and its regional proxies, such as the Houthis, toward U.S. forces and their partners in the Middle East, including increased drone activity . In light of these and other developments, the U.S. government may now be considering doubling its force posture in the region, which could involve the deployment of up 14,000 additional troops. Reports about Forrest Sherman ‘s seizure first appeared on Dec. 4, 2019, but the actual incident occurred in the North Arabian Sea on Nov. 27. A boarding party consisting of Navy sailors and members of the U.S. Coast Guard boarded a dhow that was not flying a national flag of any kind and found the missile parts during a subsequent search. The U.S. military has not definitively determined the origin of the unspecified components or their intended destination, but they are reportedly “advanced” and have hallmarks of Iranian-produced systems. “A more thorough investigation is underway,” the Pentagon said in a statement to Reuters . The Associated Press , citing unnamed U.S. officials, said that the personnel from the Forrest Sherman had seized a “ significant cache ,” but did not give any specific details about the items found on the dhow or how many were found. Of course, this is not the first time that U.S. warships, or those belonging to American allies and regional partners, have uncovered weapons, ammunition, and other military hardware of apparent Iranian origin onboard dhows and other vessels bound for the Houthis. Forrest Sherman herself has even been involved in these seizures in the past. Anti-tank guided missiles and other hardware on the deck of the USS Forrest Sherman in 2015 after another seizure off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula., USN The Iranian-backed Houthis have acquired an increasingly diverse and capable arsenal of missiles and drones in recent years, notably employing a new ground-launched land-attack cruise missile, known as the Quds-1 , against Saudi Arabia earlier this year. The group has also launched suicide drones and ballistic missiles at Saudi Arabia on numerous occasions. They have also claimed responsibility for unprecedented cruise missile and suicide drone strikes on Saudi oil infrastructure in September, though the United States has blamed Iran directly for those attacks. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SNeblGR05xE The vast majority of the missile and drone designs that the Houthis employ are similar in form and function to Iranian designs, but differ in certain respects. This has raised questions about how much of the production of these systems is actually going on in Yemen and whether Iran may be developing derivatives specifically for regional proxies for added plausible deniability regarding its support for these groups. The Forrest Sherman’s seizure may be related, at least in part, to a separate report from CNN on Dec. 3 that the United States has a new stream of intelligence indicating potential threats from Iran and its proxies toward American forces and interested in the Middle East. “There has been consistent intelligence in the last several weeks,” an unnamed official within President Donald Trump’s Administration reportedly told the outlet. CNN ‘s sources provided no specifics on what this intelligence was or how it was obtained, but did say that it had to do with reported movements of Iranian personnel and military hardware. This, in turn, could indicate preparations to launch attacks, such as the ones on Saudi Arabia in September. Also on Dec. 4, Newsweek reported , again citing unnamed U.S. government officials, that there had been an uptick in drone activity near U.S. forces at unspecified locations in the Middle East. The group or groups operating these unmanned aircraft is unclear, but there were reportedly indications that Iranian-supported militias under the direction of the Quds Force, the expeditionary arm of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , were the ones flying them. In addition to the Houthis in Yemen, Iran backs myriad armed groups across the Middle East, including in countries such as Iraq and Syria, where they often operate close to American forces. The United States has blamed Iranian-supported militias in Iraq for rocket and other indirect fire attacks near U.S. military and diplomatic facilities in recent years. Just on Dec. 3, 2019, several rockets landed near Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, where a significant contingent of American forces is located. No group has yet taken responsibility for that attack. The Newsweek story stated that these were “suicide drones,” but offered no additional information about the origins of that assessment. Newsweek ‘s sources otherwise indicated that these small unmanned aircraft had been conducting what appeared to be simply intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities and that they posed no immediate threat, which would seem to contradict the assertion that they were indeed suicide drones. The story did say that there were concerns that the drones might be gathering intelligence about potential targets for future strikes. An Iranian Lockheed P-3F Orion maritime patrol plane, which the United States delivered to the regime of the Shah of Iran in the 1970s, flies by the dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Alan Shepard in the Gulf of Oman on Nov. 11, 2019., USN All of these details that have emerged today about Iranian and Iranian-linked activities, such as they are, are well in line with the relatively steady flow of official U.S. government statements and media reports that first began appearing in May 2019. This notably started with reports that Iran was either deploying missiles on boats or otherwise moving them around the Middle East that way, potentially to launch attacks, which is extremely similar to the stories that are emerging now. This reported intelligence, coupled with actual and alleged malign behavior from Iran, including the aforementioned strikes on Saudi Arabia , the seizure of multiple foreign oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, the shootdown of a U.S. Navy drone over the Gulf of Oman, and a spate of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, has led to the deployment of approximately 14,000 additional U.S. military personnel to the Middle East over the past seven months. This has included a particularly significant new deployment of personnel, including combat jets and air and missile defense systems, to Saudi Arabia in recent months. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 4 that all of this has prompted the U.S. military to consider possibly doubling that figure, sending another 14,000 personnel to the region in the coming year. It’s unclear how much of this would necessarily be additive to the overall total force posture and how much of this might be simply rotations of fresh troops to relieve existing units in place. For instance, the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman , along with the rest of its strike group, is presently heading toward the region where it will likely take the place of the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group. Truman was supposed to have arrived earlier in the year, but was delayed due to the need for unforeseen maintenance. John Rood, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, did allude to new deployments to the Middle East in the near future to counter Iranian moves when speaking to reporters on Dec. 4. “Watch this space,” he said. “I think we’re going to be dynamic in our deployments, in our response and how we message. In private, you should know we’ve sent very clear and blunt signals to the Iranian government about the potential consequences of aggression.” It’s not clear what might be driving Iran’s latest geopolitical maneuvers. The country has been, at least to some degree, preoccupied with major domestic protests across the country that prompted the regime in Tehran to launch a violent crackdown in which security forces have killed at least 200 demonstrators already. It is the worst violence in decades and the country’s president Hassan Rouhani recently called for the release of protesters who have been rounded up in the clashes. “We’ve seen a downtick with regard to Iranian actions, and that’s a good thing,” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had told reporters on Nov. 13, 2019. “The door remains open to sit down with them anytime, anywhere to discuss the way forward diplomatically.” At the same time, Iran has repeatedly sparred rhetorically with the United States this year over crippling American sanctions and has also resumed various nuclear activities that are prohibited under an international agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or simply the Iran Nuclear Deal. The United States pulled out of the deal in 2018 and the Iranian government has been seeking to pressure the remaining parties, especially American allies France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, to continue to abide by its terms and make additional concessions ever since. How the U.S. military moves to counter the latest reported Iranian-linked activity in the Middle East, and whether or not it decides to move ahead with new, large-scale troop deployments, as well as how Tehran might react in light of those new developments, remains to be seen. It does appear that the U.S. and Iranian governments are headed toward yet another period of heightened tensions in an already turbulent region. UPDATE: 10:15pm EST— The Pentagon has disputed The Wall Street Journal ‘s reporting, with Press Secretary Alyssa Farah saying the U.S. military has no plans to send 14,000 additional personnel to the region in the near future. UPDATE: 12/5/2019— On Dec. 4, 2019, The New York Times also reported Iran had been moving stockpiles of short-range ballistic missiles into Iraq, raising further concerns that Iranian-backed militias could use the weapons in future strikes against U.S. personnel in that country or elsewhere in the region or target American allies and partners. CNN subsequently reported that these missiles had arrived in Iraq “in recent weeks.” Neither outlet identified the type or types of missiles in question or how many the U.S. government believes are now in Iraq.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",The Saga Of The AGM-129 Cruise Missile That Was Basically A Stealth Jet Designed Upside Down,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Most people would be surprised to hear that the most advanced nuclear-tipped cruise missile ever put into operation was retired from service while its predecessor, a less survivable missile it was supposed to replace, soldiers on in U.S. Air Force service to this very day. This topsy-turvy reality is somewhat metaphorical of General Dynamics’ AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM) itself. In fact, the AGM-129 could be considered the second stealth aircraft to ever enter production, because that is what it really was, albeit one that was designed upside down, and for good reason. The origins of the ACM are fairly straightforward. The AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) entered service in the early 1980s. When it was being designed, and while the non-production AGM-86A was undergoing initial trials, the best way to deliver a nuclear warhead deep inside Soviet airspace by an air-breathing platform was via low-altitude penetration . The AGM-86 was designed exactly for that, to punch through at treetop level using terrain contour matching , terrain-following radar, and inertial navigation to get close enough to a target that the W80 nuclear warhead onboard could do its job successfully. AGM-86., USAF Later on, the AGM-86C and D would integrate GPS to deliver pinpoint conventional strikes. You can read all about the AGM-86C/D’s capabilities in this recent piece of ours , but the nuclear-armed version of the era had no such accuracy. Regardless, survivability against quickly evolving Soviet air defenses was the most pressing requirement in the Air Force’s air-launched cruise missile portfolio as the 1970s gave way to the 1980s. AGM-86 being dropped by a B-52 during tests. , USAF The AGM-86B had a few stealthy characteristics, but it was far from a true low observable design. Just as it came into service, the Air Force realized that the days when being able to beat air defenses via low-flying alone were coming to an end. Airborne early warning and control aircraft and advanced fire control radars with look-down-shoot-down capabilities, like those on Russia’s 4th generation fighter and interceptor fleets (Su-27 and MiG-31, specifically), would decrease the effectiveness of nap-of-the-earth flying tactics. Something far more survivable was needed, and fast. MiG-31s and Su-27s., Russia MoD Out of a handful of DARPA initiatives and studies dubbed TEAL DAWN that explored future cruise missile technologies and long-range bomber strategies, it was concluded that the new stealth bomber then in development alone wouldn’t be survivable against the densest Soviet air defenses. Long-range and survivable standoff weapons would be needed in part to mitigate those defenses. Two requirements were established—one stealthy missile that could travel around 1,500 miles or more and another that could travel over 5,000 miles. The latter clearly invalidated much of the need for a stealth bomber in the first place and it was thought that at least a decade would be needed to develop such a long-range weapon.  As a result, it was jettisoned to concentrate on the shorter-ranged stealthy cruise missile requirement that could be fielded quickly and equip the Air Force’s new stealth bomber—at least that’s what they hoped. With this in mind, a competition to build such a weapon was quietly launched. Lockheed, Boeing, and General Dynamics ended up squaring off in secret for this new contract. Lockheed’s Skunk Works leveraged their work on the F-117 program, which was just spinning up in a very secretive operational state at the time , to produce its F-117-shaped cruise missile, known under the code name SENIOR PROM. The details surrounding Boeing’s design remain unclear. General Dynamics’ design was a bit more of a traditional configuration, but one that was clean-sheet and packed with very stealthy features arranged in unique ways to maximize its effectiveness and efficiency. SENIOR PROM, which was a test program before competing for the Advanced Cruise Missile contract, was very stealthy, but it would have been troublesome fitting it into a bomber’s weapons bay. By 1983, General Dynamics clenched the contract and the AGM-129A Advanced Cruise Missile was officially born. Lockheed’s SENIOR PROM stealth cruise missile based on its still then very secret F-117 Nighthawk design. , Public Domain General Dynamics’ design, which measured nearly 21 feet long and weighed in at 3,700 pounds, was downright wicked looking. A faceted, stiletto-shaped fuselage with a chined, sharp-tip nose area and forward-swept pop-out wings gave it a sinister, almost Klingon-like look. Not just the wings were backward, all the low observable features were oriented towards defeating detection from above , not below. This resulted in an upside-down-looking airframe of sorts. The vertical stabilizer-rudder pointed down instead of up. It was made up of composite materials, as were the missile’s horizontal forward-swept stabilizers, to remain nearly invisible to the most threatening radar bands. The vertical stabilizer was also offset to the left side of the fuselage’s centerline. Semanticscholar.org/USAF That gas from the missile’s two-dimensional exhaust aperture was blown over a platypus-like defuser structure that shielded its signature from, you guessed it, above, instead of below. The exhaust was also mixed with cold air to help further attenuate its infrared signature. Soviet infrared search and track (IRST) systems were advancing in capability at the time and included on all of Russia’s 4th generation fighter/interceptor designs, so infrared signature reduction was weighted heavily alongside radar cross-section reduction during the competition that led to the AGM-129. The AGM-129 seen in stowed configuration during climate testing at Eglin AFB. , USAF The low-observable trapezoidal air inlet sat flush on the bottom of the missile instead of the top of it and fed the engine with air through a serpentine duct, thus eliminating any radar return from the engine fan face. Realizing a flush air inlet on something that flies at transonic speeds comes with major design challenges and it’s not like any stealthy air inlet configuration is easy to design or produce , to begin with. Beyond its underlying radar-evading structures , the AGM-129 was also covered with radar absorbent material and coatings and given an olive drab color to blend in with the terrain it would roar over just before sparking off a nuclear apocalypse. USAF So, if you think the AGM-129 looks like it is flying inverted, that is by very conscious design. Overall, the missile was designed with a particular weight put on stealth from its upper and forward aspects, where it was most vulnerable. From directly to its side, its radar signature was reduced, but more visible than from other angles. This was deemed a non-issue because the pulse-doppler radars that could threaten it from above are unable to detect low-flying targets hiding in ground clutter while flying at perpendicular angles to the radar antenna as they remain inside the radar’s “doppler notch.” You can read more about this phenomenon and the tactics associated with it here. Navigation was also innovative. The AGM-129 introduced a laser doppler velocimeter into its navigational suite, which, like the AGM-86, also included inertial navigation and terrain contour matching. This gave it substantially better accuracy over long distances than the AGM-86B, which was designed less than a decade before it. It also included laser detection and ranging system (LADAR) to aid in low-altitude flight, which further allowed it to fine-tune its endgame attack run down to as accurate as 90 feet according to stated metrics, although the system likely became even more accurate as it matured. Considering it still packed the same W80 variable yield warhead (5kt-150kt) as the AGM-86B, its better accuracy substantially increased its effectiveness, especially against reinforced targets or those that are partially shielded by terrain. LADAR, as opposed to radar, also allowed the AGM-129 to remain electromagnetically silent, giving off no radio frequency energy when it was most vulnerable and thus making it even harder to detect. There were some tradeoffs though, LADAR could have trouble receiving data against certain surfaces, such as those that were extremely reflective or highly light absorbent. Still, the system was extremely effective and because the missile was so stealthy, it could fly at higher altitudes and in most cases still survive to make it to its target if need be. ACM during a test. , FAS.ORG Still, the system was not perfect. During one test over Dugway Proving Ground in 1997, an AGM-129 was flying so low it impacted some trailers belonging to an observatory. Nobody was hurt in the incident and the missile had been flying for three and a half hours before the accident. It turns out the mission planners had no idea the trailers were there and how the missile got so low was unclear to begin with. The missile was fast, traveling at just under the speed of sound, and it also packed a very long range. It used a far more fuel-efficient engine, the Williams International F112-WR-100 turbofan, than the one found on the AGM-86, which gave it significantly greater range while retaining similar dimensions and the same payload. Officially, ACM could reach out 2,000 miles to its target , but it seems clear that its real range was actually significantly further, especially when flying a more efficient flight profile during more benign portions of its trip to its target area. As noted earlier, the missile’s high degree of stealth meant that it could climb to more efficient altitudes during certain phases of flight and still have a high chance of surviving to complete its horrific task. Another interesting component of the AGM-129 was its computer system. From how it has been explained to me it used basically one central processor and computing system to run the vast majority of the missile’s functions. For early 1980s military technology, this is an amazing feat. Basically, the computer system and the system designed to used it on the missile was absolutely cutting-edge for its time. An incredible gathering of 1990s stealth technology, with the AGM-129 in the foreground and the F-117 and B-2 in the background.  , USAF It can’t be stressed enough how advanced the ACM was for its time. It had many elements that hadn’t yet emerged from the classified manned aircraft realm, but was an autonomous system meant to fly thousands of miles to its target without aid and to be built by the hundreds. It was truly a highly sensitive modern marvel of its era. The first flight test of an AGM-129 occurred in July of 1985, with the first production missiles being delivered two years later, in 1987. It was that year when the program became public, as well. In that sense, it was the first disclosure of a stealth flying machine ever. Still, the program struggled early in its production run. There were technological issues that popped up in flight testing, but the major problems were with building the advanced missiles themselves. Remember, at the time of its first deliveries, no stealth aircraft had even been acknowledged by the Air Force. This wouldn’t occur until two years later when the F-117 was officially disclosed to the public. So, the technologies used in its manufacturing were absolutely cutting-edge in nature. The missile’s very aggressive concurrent testing and production schedule concept and major labor issues with the International Association of Machinists began to cripple the program and it quickly became a pariah on Capitol Hill and in certain parts of the Pentagon. By the end of the decade, the AGM-129 was being declared a fiasco. Things got so bad with quality control issues that production was halted between 1989 and 1991. ACMs being manufactured at the General Dynamics plant. , FAS.ORG Of course, the timing of this setback couldn’t have been worse. The Cold War was ending and the defense budget was set to snap back hard, especially in terms of strategic weaponry. In addition, the B-2 wouldn’t fly until 1989 and still would have a long developmental road ahead of it. The B-1B was also having its own troubles and the missile was never designed to fit in its weapons bays , it was too long, and eventually, the B-1B would lose its nuclear role altogether. So, the weapon that was procured at least in part to be paired with the stealth bomber would be relegated to the B-52. The confluence of these factors, as well as the START treaty which limited these types of weapons, resulted in a drastic reduction of the programmed buy. The nearly 1,500 missiles needed to replace the AGM-86B in full was slashed down to less than half that, and eventually to a final number of just 460 missiles. Unit cost soared partially as a result of the curtailed order, with each missile costing roughly $4.3 million in 1992 dollars. This is extremely expensive for a cruise missile even by today’s standards. A decade earlier, the AGM-86Bs cost around $1.3 million each. The ACM had truly entered a Pentagon budgetary ‘death spiral’ alongside the plane that was supposed to carry it, the B-2. President Bush underneath an ACM., FAS.org Still, they were the most advanced cruise missiles in the world and the truncated force of 460 missiles soldiered on over the next two decades, exclusively equipping the B-52 force. A single B-52 could carry 20 of the missiles at one time. Six on each wing pylon and eight in the jet’s cavernous weapons bay on a rotary launcher. Two other AGM-129 variants were proposed, but never came to fruition. The AGM-129B was a shadowy initiative to equip a revised design with an axial-flow jet engine, new software, and a different nuclear warhead to take on a specialized role that remains classified. This could have been a GPS-equipped, imaging infrared, or otherwise more precise upgrade of the weapon that would also be equipped with a penetrating nuclear warhead of a lower yield to take on heavily fortified bunkers and more hardened structures. Then again, maybe it was something more exotic, we just don’t know for absolute certain. ACMs loaded onto a B-52. , USAF The other proposed variant was a conventional land attack model similar to the AGM-86C/D Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (CALCM), but far more survivable and with a lot longer reach. GPS would have been necessary for this weapon, just like it was for its CALCM progenitor. An imaging infrared seeker with imaging matching could have been injected into the design for even better accuracy. In retrospect, this would have been a relatively amazing weapon. The ACMs that were built may have received a GPS upgrade sometime during the decade and a half or so that followed their introduction into service in 1990, although it remains unclear if this actually happened. It would have given the missiles pinpoint accuracy, but GPS connectivity would not be assured during a nuclear war and it may have been cost-prohibitive to integrate a GPS antenna onto the ACM’s stealth airframe. If the upgrade did happen, it would have likely occurred when the missiles were put through a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) in the early 2000s that would allow them to serve until 2030 and possibly beyond. Regardless of this life extension program, in 2007, the 17th year of the AGM-129’s operational service, it was decided that the entire ACM force would be drawn down and eliminated from service by the end of 2012. A number of factors contributed to this decision, the first being the post 9/11 focus on counter-insurgency operations instead of preparing for peer state conflicts. The U.S. had two raging wars on its hands that were anything but cheap, and the Russian bear remained largely dormant at the time, while China was just on precipice its economic, geopolitical, and technological rise. The AGM-129 program, with its relatively small fleet made up of super high-tech 1980s technology, meant that sustaining the missiles was far from a cheap or easy task. The AGM-86B, although much less survivable, checked a box for much less money and had commonality with its conventionally armed cousin, the AGM-86C/D, which helped significantly in terms of sustainment scalability. Beyond fiscal matters, the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) with Russia also meant more warheads would be pulled off the front lines. So, the Air Force moved forward with not just retiring the AGM-129, but destroying the fleet, a task that was completed as planned by the end of 2012. During its drawdown period, one highly publicized and unfortunate event occurred with what were historically very shy missiles. On August 30th, 2007 a “Bent Spear” incident occurred with a package of 12 ACMs. A B-52H was set to ferry unarmed ACMs from Minot AFB in North Dakota to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana. The missiles were to be decommissioned at Barksdale, so the mission itself wasn’t necessarily out of the ordinary. What was not normal is that six of the missiles were actually carrying their W-80 thermonuclear warheads. The nuclear-armed B-52 sat overnight without a proper security detail and other precautions until the crew showed up for the mission the next day. During pre-flight checks, the crew did not inspect both pylons loaded with missiles. They only inspected the one that held six unarmed ACMs, but logged that both pylons full of missiles were indeed checked and that they were unarmed. The crews then flew across the Midwest not knowing they were carrying six nuclear warheads. A B-52H seen with a ‘package’ of ACMs pre-loaded on their pylon at Minot AFB. , USAF After arriving at Barksdale, the jet sat for another eight hours without standard precautions associated with nuclear-armed aircraft. It was nearly a day and a half after the Minot AFB personnel blew off normal procedures and loaded the hot ACMs on the B-52 that the fact that the plane was actually carrying live warheads was discovered. The incident was the first of its kind in four decades and sent shockwaves through the Air Force and the Pentagon. A subsequent investigation showed horrible disregard for critical nuclear weapons handling protocols and everyone from four unit commanders down to those directly involved were heavily disciplined or removed from duty. All nuclear weapons handling was suspended at Minot AFB. It also resulted in a new set of procedures that were designed to make sure such a breakdown in procedures doesn’t happen again. It was a sad end to the troubled development and career of the world’s first stealth cruise missile. ACMs on a B-52., USAF/Public Domain In retrospect, the decision not just to retire, but fully destroy the AGM-129 cadre seems like a very poor one. Today, the Air Force is working on developing a new stealthy long-range nuclear-tipped cruise missile, the Long-Range Stand-Off (LRSO) weapon, a program that will cost tens of billions of dollars and won’t produce an operational missile until at least 2030. Raytheon, which owns the AGM-129 design after it bought Hughes Missile Systems, which bought General Dynamics’ missile portfolio prior, is competing with Lockheed for the LRSO contract. In the meantime, the AGM-86B is supposed to remain a viable deterrent even in an era of ever more capable highly integrated air defense systems, ones that now rely on look-down-shoot-down sensors more than they did 35 years ago and that are far more advanced in general than what existed when ACM was conceived. This begs the question, is the AGM-86B really a survivable deterrent at all? The true answer, that we will never officially get, is probably less comforting than we may want to hear. The truth is, the AGM-129 was way ahead of its time. Today, there are numerous stealthy cruise missiles in production or will be in production soon and they are becoming an extremely sought-after item. The USAF can’t get enough of Lockheed’s JASSM family of missiles , which continues to rapidly grow in capability, while the Navy is procuring the anti-ship LRASM cousin of JASSM, the stealthy Naval Strike Missile , and a powered version of the JSOW. Multiple foreign militaries have their own stealthy cruise missiles , as well. But these are conventionally armed weapons. It will be at least another decade until a nuclear-armed stealth cruise missile hits the USAF’s inventory again. That weapon, the LRSO, will be in many ways the son of AGM-129 and from what we are hearing, it will be absolutely loaded with the latest and greatest technology that will allow it to survive in the most inhospitable of combat environments. It is also meant to equip the USAF’s new stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider. Somehow this all sounds eerily familiar, doesn’t it?

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 22, 2020",Navy Amphibious Warfare Ship USS Portland Spotted Heading To Sea With New Laser Turret (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As expected, the San Antonio class landing platform dock USS Portland has left its homeport in San Diego, California sporting its new high-energy laser directed energy weapon from Northrop Grumman. The War Zone was first to identify that this was the mysterious system that the defense contractor was shipping to San Diego by barge from Redondo Beach back in October. Twitter account WarshipCam, which scans public webcams around the world for naval vessels, spotted Portland and her newest system heading out from San Diego on the SunDiegoLive.com stream on Dec. 2, 2019. The Navy had first announced its plans to install the laser on this ship as part of the Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) program in 2018. At-sea testing was originally scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of the 2019 Fiscal Year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2019. At the time of writing, neither the U.S. Navy nor Northrop Grumman has released a statement regarding Portland and its participation in the SSL-TM program. We have reached out to the Navy to hopefully get more information about the upcoming tests and the service’s overall plans for the project at present. The SSL-TM prototype at Northrop Grumman’s facility in Redondo Beach, California in October 2019., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Regardless it is a significant and exciting achievement to see the SSL-TM laser go to sea for the first time. The Navy envisions the system as being able to primarily provide enhanced defense against swarms of small boats and unmanned aircraft, as well as serving as a stepping stone to more powerful lasers in the future. SSL-TM is one of four programs that makes up the Navy Laser Family of Systems that the service is working on at present. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey also recently appeared in San Diego with what appears to be the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system, something The War Zone was also first to report on and that you can read about more here . A graphic depicting the components of the SSL-TM laser installation on the Portland ., USN An infographic showing the Navy Laser Family of Systems and how the Navy sees those programs supporting follow-on laser developments., USN Of course, this isn’t the first time the Navy has installed a laser weapon system on a ship, having already reached that milestone with the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System (LaWS) on the USS Ponce , an Austin class landing platform dock-turned-sea base that operated primarily in the Middle East until 2017. SSL-TM is a follow-on to the LaWS, as well as the Maritime Laser Demonstration (MLD) effort, which ran between 2010 and 2011. Northrop Grumman developed both LaWS and MLD. https://youtube.com/watch?v=awsQs4ct0c4 However, the SSL-TM laser promises to be significantly more powerful than either of these previous systems, being in the 150-kilowatt class. The prototype laser developed under the MLD program was in the 15-kilowatt class, though Northrop Grumman did also demonstrate a system consisting of multiple lasers that created a single beam with a combined power of 105 kilowatts. The LaWS laser was in the 30-kilowatt class. The SSL-TM testing on Portland will be important to demonstrate that the various components of the new system, including the beam director and the power generation and cooling equipment, work as intended in the harsh maritime environment and can sustain routine operation of the laser at full power. The Navy has said in the past that this will provide valuable information for crafting improved prototypes and eventually operational systems, including through follow-on programs that are already in the works. It will also offer an opportunity to develop and refine concepts of operation around using the higher-powered laser. A now-dated briefing slide on the SSL-TM program showing various target sets the Navy envisioned for the laser. Before choosing the Portland, the Navy had planned to use the decommissioned Spruance class destroyer USS Paul F. Foster , which now serves as the service’s designated Self Defense Test Ship , for the SSL-TM program. The plan in the past has also been to eventually transition a version of the system onto Arleigh Burke class destroyers ., USN Another briefing slide detailing operational applications for the SSL-TM laser., USN “We don’t want to wait for the next step to learn this stuff that we can learn now,” Frank Peterkin, the Navy’s senior directed energy technologist, told USNI News in February 2019. “This won’t change just because we go to a higher power laser. So we can burn down a lot of this operational risk, not just for the interactions and the interface but also being in close proximity to other weapons. And how do you coordinate, how do you decide what to shoot and when, things like that.” Whatever happens during the upcoming tests, Portland has now become a key part of the next major chapter in the Navy’s directed energy efforts. UPDATE: 12/4/2019— U.S. Navy Lieutenant J.G. Rachel McMarr, a Pacific Fleet spokesperson, has provided the following statement regarding Portland and the SSL-TM program: “The Solid State Laser – Technology Maturation Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (SSL-TM LWSD) is installed onboard USS Portland (LPD-27). However, as a matter of policy, we will not discuss installation specifics of the LWSD system, or planned or potential future operations.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Directed Energy Lasers News & Features"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There reports of an unusual U.S. airstrike on a minivan in a city in northwestern Syria less than 10 miles from where American special operators conducted a raid just over a month ago that led to the death of brutal ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It appears that this targeted strike also involved the use of an extremely specialized variant of the Hellfire missile, known as the AGM-114R9X , which substitutes the warhead found on standard models for a set of folding sword-like blades for minimum collateral damage. The strike reportedly occurred in Atmeh, which is situated in Syria’s Idlib province. The city is less than five miles from the Turkish border and lies fewer than 10 miles northwest of Barisha, where Al Baghdadi’s compound was located. There are reports that two individuals in the van died, but their identities and if they are affiliated with any known terrorist groups are unclear at the time of writing. There is one report that at least one person who was killed belonged to Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, or HTS, a group that splintered from Al Qaeda’s franchise in Syria in 2017. A map showing the general location of Atmeh and Barisha, to the south, within Syria., Google Maps A closer view showing the relative proximity of Atmeh and Barisha, to its south., Google Maps Pictures that have emerged of the van so far offer limited views of the damage, but it is clear that the weapon involved did not have a traditional warhead. The van in Atmeh shows extensive damage toward the front passenger side, but limited damage otherwise the rest of the vehicle. There are reports that the men inside the vehicle were “mashed” inside by the impact. There are clear similarities here to a strike that killed Abu Khayr Al Masri, then Al Qaeda’s number two leader, as he drove in his car in Al Mastouma, Syria, in 2017. This city is also in Idlib and is some 30 miles south of Atmeh. Al Masri’s car also suffered the most damage toward the front passenger side and is known to have been the work of an AGM-114R9X , which has reportedly been used extremely sparingly. The War Zone was the first to call attention to the likelihood that a previously unknown munition was used in that strike, which turned out to be the case. Without seeing the top of the van in Atmeh, which could show telltale signs of the AGM-114R9X’s blades striking the vehicle, and with such little additional information about the individuals who died in the strike, it is impossible to say for certain who may have been responsible and exactly weapons they may have been employed. However, the similarities between the two strikes strongly point to the AGM-114R9X being employed. The pictures of the van do show it in a relatively confined urban area, where a weapon capable of causing extremely minimal collateral damage would be ideal, as well. We also know that U.S. unmanned aircraft, such as MQ-9 Reapers, which can carry Hellfire missiles and are known to carry out targeted strikes, operate in this region of Syria. On Nov. 22, 2019, photojournalist Rami Al Sayed caught a glimpse of a Reaper flying in the area of Jindires in Syria, a town in Aleppo province that is located around six miles north of Atmeh. The particular aircraft was carrying four Hellfire missiles, a range-extending drop tank, and two other unknown pods. It is very likely that this latter pair of stores contained a mixture of sensors, such as radars with ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and synthetic aperture functionality and geo-location systems to zero in on targeted cellular or satellite telephone signals, as well as advanced data links . An MQ-9 Reaper seen flying near Jindires on Nov. 22, 2019., Rami Al Sayed/AFP via Getty Images Tracking and targeting terrorists based on the location of their phones is a known U.S. tactic and it would not be surprising that American unmanned aircraft, as well as manned platforms and assets on the ground, have been combing the area for those signals in the aftermath of the raid on Baghdadi’s compound. The Pentagon said that operation resulted in the seizure of a significant amount of intelligence that would be valuable in identifying and tracking down other major ISIS figures. On Dec. 3, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the raid had produced “good information,” including lists of ISIS financiers. Trump was speaking to reporters during a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in London on the sidelines of the annual NATO summit, which began that day. “I can’t tell you anything about what we took off the site. You’ll appreciate that,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told had also reporters during a briefing about the raid on Oct. 30, 2019. “We’re going to exploit that, and we expect it to help us as we go forward.” In the immediate aftermath of Baghdadi’s death, the United States also killed ISIS’ then-number two leader, Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, in another airstrike. The terrorist group subsequently named Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi as its new leader . In Tweet on Nov. 1, 2019, Trump indicated that he was also known to U.S. intelligence agencies, saying “ISIS has a new leader. We know exactly who he is!” Given reports that a member of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) died in the van, it is also possible that, if the United States did indeed carry out the strike in Atmeh, that it was targeting members of another group. If that’s the case, this would be the first reported U.S. strike aimed specifically at HTS since 2017. The U.S. military also acknowledged a strike on leaders of Al Qaeda’s present Syrian franchise, known as AQ-S, in Aleppo province on June 30, 2019. This is to say nothing of the strike on Al Masri back in 2017. The future of U.S.-led operations in Syria, in general, had been unclear following Turkey launching an intervention into areas along its shared border with the country in October 2019. This operation targeted the American-supported and predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and prompted U.S. personnel to hastily withdraw from many forward operating locations . Despite Trump’s announcement of a total withdrawal of American forces from the country, the United States has since bolstered certain positions, in eastern Syria, notably in and around numerous oil-producing areas. This has included the deployment of mechanized infantry from the Army National Guard with Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles into Dier Ez Zor province. The U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in both Syria and Iraq said in November that it had resumed operations against that terrorist group in that region. Elements of the 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team, a unit of the US Army National Guard, including M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, on patrol in Syria., US Army The Syrian conflict otherwise remains very fluid, especially with the new complexities that the Turkish intervention has brought, including a deal with Russia to secure a buffer zone along Syria’s northern border. How all of this has impacted activities targeting the terrorist group’s leader further West is unclear. The apparent U.S. targeted strike in Atmeh would indicate that the United States continues to actively pursue ISIS and other terrorist leaders in western Syria despite the shifting battle lines in the country and uncertainties in over-arching U.S. policy toward the conflict. UPDATE: 4:55pm EST— Nick Waters, a senior investigator at Bellingcat , who was first to notice the blade strikes from the AGM-114R9X on Abu Khayr Al Masri’s car after the strike in 2017, has found evidence of similar damage in the strike in Atmeh. This provides even more evidence that this was the missile employed in this strike. UPDATE: 7:40pm EST— An image has emerged of what may be a portion of the AGM-114R9X used in the Atmeh strike. UPDATE: 8:25pm EST— A reader has informed us that the minivan in question is a Mitsubishi Delica L400 , which is available as a right-hand drive vehicle and that this particular example appears to be in that configuration. This means that the missile impacted the front driver side, not the passenger side. UPDATE: 10:10pm EST— The War Zone has given the wreckage of the AGM-114R9X missile from the Atmeh attack a closer look, which you can find here .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 8, 2019",This Photo Proves How The Hellfire Missile That Uses Blades Instead Of Explosives Works,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the most recent known use of the AGM-114R9X Hellfire missile, a weapon that uses blades instead of explosives to kill its target with minimal collateral damage, literally smashing and slicing through them, evidence of exactly how the bizarre weapon works has come to light. Imagery from the scene of the attack, located less than 10 miles from where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in Syria, shows what appears to be the core of the weapon and its deadly appendages. It appears to be a gruesome, but stunningly effective device. The image, seen at the top of this story, shows a thick central hub structure that would act as a penetrator with six swing-out skeletonized blades. Basically, anything in the radius of the blades would die. The standard AGM-114 flies at roughly 1,000 miles per hour. It isn’t clear if this version of the weapon hits those speeds, but there is no indication otherwise. It’s unclear when exactly the blades deploy during use, but it is likely that they extend out from the missile via fairings that pop-off shortly before its flight ends or swing-out through slots in the missile’s body. A fuze system or direct inertia system could deploy them once the missile makes contact with a surface, as well. The Hellfire is just over five feet long, with its warhead section taking up the central area of the missile’s tube-like body. You can see how this payload would slot into where the explosive warhead would otherwise go in the image below: AGM-114 internal configuration. , Stahlkocher/Wikicommons The payload area is roughly a foot and a half long and let’s say the swords are roughly the same length, this would provide about a three and a half foot diameter kill zone, which is similar to what we see in the images of the vehicles that have been struck. It is the ultimate precision air-to-ground weapon—surgical both in metaphor and application. It would be highly interesting to see how this almost comic-book-like adaptation of the AGM-114 came to be. We definitely know there are places where these types of payloads are tested and the need for such a weapon obvious, but how such melding of old and new weaponry came to be would be fascinating to understand. In fact, I am just as interested in all the pitches that didn’t get selected considering how wild the one that did is. The image at least verifies how many of us thought this system would work and fits with the few non-attributed descriptions of its general concept of operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 3, 2019",China’s New Surveillance Blimp In The South China Sea Is Likely Just The Beginning,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery from last month shows that a tethered aerostat, a type of unmanned airship, floating in the air above one of China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea . This lighter-than-air craft is almost certainly carrying a sensor system of some kind, such as a radar. A network of these platforms could help provide additional, but relatively low-cost early warning capabilities, especially against low-flying cruise missiles, and improved general situational awareness throughout the disputed region. Private satellite imagery from intelligence firm ImageSat International first released the image of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands showing the aerostat on Nov. 24, 2019. One of the company’s satellites had grabbed this image of the island six days earlier. The reef is one of the largest of China’s controversial man-made outcroppings in the South China Sea, which the country has been expanding since 2014. “For the first time, #China’s aerostat, probably for #military #intelligence-gathering purposes, seen by #ISI at #Mischief Reef,” a Tweet from iSi on Nov. 24 read. “The use of #aerostat allows China a continuous situational awareness in this resource-rich region.” China has reportedly been actively developing aerostats for military use for at least two decades, according to Jane’s 360 , which said it could not immediately identify the type of airship seen in the imagery. The image does show it hovering to the eastern side of the port facility on the island. It makes sense to keep it away from the large runway on the western side of the island, as it could pose a hazard to aircraft. ImageSat International An annotated satellite image showing the locations of various Chinese facilities on Mischief Reef as of 2016., DOD/Digital Globe A map showing the location of Chinese man-made outposts in the Spratly Islands, including Mischief Reef, which had initially been classified as two seperate outposts., DOD It is also impossible to tell what sensor or sensors it might be carrying from the imagery. One of the most likely options would be a radar with air and surface search and potentially acquisition and fire control capabilities. A radar-carrying aerostat would provide a very capable, but also a relatively cheap option for monitoring various activity around Mischief Reef, as well as potentially cueing surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles to engage potential threats. The elevated position would help increase the overall range of the system substantially, which would be especially valuable for spotting low-flying threats, such as cruise missiles or swarms of small unmanned aircraft as they crest over the horizon. Though China is steadily improving the defenses on its man-made islands , low-flying cruise missiles certainly represent a continuing threat to its outposts. Aerostat-mounted radar systems can also remain aloft for long periods and, depending on their exact capabilities, in many types of weather, making them far more cost-effective and easier to maintain than manned aerial sensor platforms. They can also fly much higher, and therefore have far longer line-of-sight to the horizon, than even large mast-mounted ground-based radars . The aerostat flying over Mischief Reef may also have electro-optical and infrared camera packages, which could provide more immediate surveillance coverage around the island. It can also act as a radio relay so that line-of-sight communications are more robust with vessels and other islands nearby. Other payloads, such as those that provide signals intelligence, are another possibility. Again, the tethered aerostat platform offers a low-cost, but persistent means of providing this kind of sensor coverage around fixed locations. China would hardly be the first country to employ aerostats in this way. The U.S. military infamously poured billions of dollars into the abortive Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, or JLENS , between 1996 and 2017. Prototypes of this tethered aerostat surveillance system carried either a VHF-band surveillance radar or an X-band fire control radar. The JLENS program experienced significant cost growth and delays leading to its effective cancellation two years ago. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does operate a number of Tethered Aerostat Radar Systems (TARS) across the southern border of the United States and in the Caribbean, primarily to support counter-drug operations. Each one of these aerostats carries a Lockheed Martin L-88 wide-area surveillance radar . US Customs and Border Protection TARS sites., US Customs and Border Protection The U.S. Army, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, use a number of different types of tethered aerostats to provide exactly this kind of additional situational awareness around bases and forward outposts around the world. Many other countries, especially in the Middle East, are also now operating these American-made systems, such as the Persistent Threat Detection System (PTSD), Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS), Persistent Surveillance Systems-Tethered (PSS-T), and the Altus , as well. A member of the Afghan National Army stands underneath a U.S.-supplied PGSS aerostat. The turret that houses electro-optical and infrared cameras is visible on a frame below the lighter-than-air craft., USN The arrival of an aerostat at Mischief Reif could easily just be the start of an array of lighter-than-air craft carrying various systems positioned on China’s other man-made islands in the South China Sea as part of larger surveillance, target acquisition, and communications networks. It also makes sense that Mischief Reef would be where the Chinese military would start in its deployment of these capabilities, as it is one of the larger man-made outposts. The U.S. Navy’s Independence class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) USS Gabrielle Giffords , the first ship of this class of ships to carry the service’s new RGM-184A Naval Strike Missile , passed by Mischief Reef on Nov. 20, 2019, just two days after iSi’s image showed the aerostat there. Giffords was conducting a so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrol, or FONOP, which the United States performs to challenge China’s expansive and widely disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea and elsewhere . This patrol, together with another that the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer performed the following day in the Paracel Islands, which lie hundreds of miles to the northwest of the Spratlys, drew a particularly sharp rebuke from China. “The U.S. has kept sending naval vessels to stir up trouble in the South China Sea under the pretext of freedom of navigation,” a statement from the People’s Liberation Army’s Southern Theater Command read. “We call on the U.S. to stop such provocative acts to avoid the happening of any mishap.” Tethered aerostats with radars on board could definitely help give China more advance notice of FONOPs without a heavy reliance on airborne or even space-based assets. This, in turn, might give the People’s Liberation Army or China’s other security services more opportunities to challenge the Americans and try to prevent them from reaching their intended destination. The Chinese have shown a willingness to do this in the past, with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 052C Luyang II -class destroyer Lanzhou notably coming close to colliding with the Arleigh Burke class USS Decatur near Gaven Reefs, also in the Spratlys, during an incident in September 2018. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Type 052C Luyang II -class destroyer Lanzhou ,  at right, nearly collides with the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Decatur , at left, in September 2018., USN If nothing else, aerostats could offer a significant boost in China’s general situational awareness in the South China Sea. Whatever China’s aerostat plans in the South China Sea turn out to be, these platforms are certainly well suited to expanding the country’s already significant anti-access and area denial capabilities in this heavily disputed region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Russia Plans To Set Up Massive New Radar Array To Help “Control” The Arctic Region,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it will set up a new, long-range over-the-horizon radar system to help “control” the Arctic by providing additional early warning and monitoring capability with regards to various potential threats, including aircraft , cruise missiles , and hypersonic weapons . This announcement comes just over a week after the head of U.S. Northern Command, who is also in charge of the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command, called for revitalization and expansion of similar American capabilities in this ever more strategic region. The Russian Ministry of Defense revealed that the next 29B6 Konteiner radar would be installed in the Arctic on Dec. 2, 2019, according to state media outlet TASS . The day before, the first Konteiner radar, situated in the semi-autonomous Russian republic of Mordovia , officially began operations, six years after Russia finished building that system . From there, it provides early warning and general monitoring coverage of Russia’s western flank, reportedly including most of Europe and portions of the Middle East. “Further development [of 29B6 sites] is possible towards control of the Arctic,” Mikhail Petrov, Konteiner’s chief designer, told TASS . “This is what we are dealing with at present and this task is being actively considered.” Konteiner is an extremely large, bistatic system consisting of separate high-frequency transmitter and receiver arrays. The complete transmitter array, which has 36 masts, is just over 1,440 feet wide, while the 144 masts that make up the receiver are spread across an area 4,265 feet wide. The transmitter and receiver sites in Mordovia are around 186 miles from each other. A diagram showing the dimensions of the various components of the 29B6’s reciever array., via GlobalSecurity.org The system provides fixed coverage in one particular direction across a 180-degree arc. It can reportedly detect and track objects right up to the edge of space and between 1,240 and 1,864 miles away, depending on the size and type of the target, as well as weather and other atmospheric conditions. The 29B6 radar bounces its signals off Earth’s ionosphere, an upper region of the atmosphere, to detect targets at such extreme ranges. It does also mean that it is blinded to threats outside of its field of view, though. These types of over-the-horizon radars are useful for tracking the movement of targets at extended distances, but do not provide the necessary fidelity to actually cue surface-to-air missiles or anti-missile interceptors to shoot them down. They do, however, provide valuable early warning of potential threats as part of an integrated air defense network, so that aircraft, ships, and other ground-based sensors can work identify and possibly engage them. Their range means they can also be positioned further inland, making them less vulnerable to short and no-notice attacks. Setting up a second 29B6 system somewhere in northern Russia pointed toward the Arctic would make good sense and could potentially provide a wide-reaching, if more generalized capability to monitor for air and missile threats in the increasingly important region. Konteiner’s range could allow it to be positioned in a more hospitable environment rather than a location well above the Arctic circle, where it could be expensive and complicated to build and maintain the necessary facilities. It would still be linked to the larger Russian integrated air defense network, which would include smaller ground-based radars, aircraft, and ships based at a growing number of rehabilitated or all-new Arctic facilities that the country has been building in the past few years. Some of these air bases are already supporting increased numbers of aerial patrols in Russia’s far north, which could benefit from the general information the 29B6 would provide to immediately identify potential tracks of interest. A smaller, mobile radar system near the Arctkicheski Trilistnik, a new Russian base on Alexandra Land, an island in the Franz Josef archipelago, north of the Arctic Circle. , Russian Ministry of Defense It’s not clear exactly how capable Konteiner actually is at spotting and tracking low-flying cruise missiles or modern hypersonic threats, such as boost-glide vehicles or air-breathing hypersonic missiles . Regardless, it would still provide important additional long-range radar coverage toward the Arctic. The Kremlin’s focus on using the 29B6 to monitor for these threats from that region, as well as from other vectors, could indicate that Russia is increasingly concerned about American air- and sea-launched hypersonic weapons . This includes missiles that will eventually be available for some U.S. Navy submarines that could hide under the Arctic ice before launching a strike. Though the Russians have no specifically highlighted this capability, as a lower frequency radar system , the 29B6 could have the ability to at least detect the presence of incoming stealth aircraft or missiles . It is important to note that bistatic low-frequency active and passive radars do not negate stealth technology and the 29B6 would not be able to provide accurate enough information for an engagement quality radar track. Russia isn’t the only one concerned about its Arctic flank being exposed, either. On Nov. 23, 2019, U.S. Air Force General Terrence John O’Shaughnessy, commander of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), raised concerns about limited U.S. military situational awarness in the region at the Halifax International Security Forum in Washington, D.C. “We have to be aware of what is happening in that environment,” O’Shaughnessy said . At present, NORAD relies heavily on the North Warning System (NWS), which includes 15 AN/FPS-117 long-range radars and 39 AN/FPS-124 short-range radars positioned across northern Canada. The NWS is the successor to the Cold War-era Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, a significant portion of which was deactivated as part of the transition process in the late 1980s. A map showing the North Warning System as it was planned in 1987. The end of the Cold War led to portions of the system being curtailed., Noclador via Wikipedia The U.S. military also operates a number of large phased-array radars , primarily designed for detecting and tracking ballistic missiles, some of which provide coverage over the Arctic. These include Solid State Phased Array Radars in Alaska, Greenland , and the United Kingdom. These terrestrial sensors are further bolstered by space-based early-warning assets, an area where Russia has historically had much less capacity. Unfortunately, the foreboding environment makes improving ground-based U.S. early warning capability in the Arctic, including to be able to better spot cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons, which the Pentagon also sees as growing threats, as difficult for the United States as it is for Russia. “We’ve done this before,” NORTHCOM and NORAD chief O’Shaughnessy said . “Simple things become hard,” he added, citing specifically how satellite communications become more difficult above 65 degrees parallel north latitude due to how the satellite constellations are situated in orbit. Whether this means the United States may also turn to over-the-horizon radars, as the Russians appear to be, or focus more on other terrestrial capabilities or simply expanding polar satellite early warning coverage instead remains to be seen. It’s also not clear when Russia’s 29B6 radar pointed toward the Arctic may become operational. Russia began developing Konteiner back in 2007 and only finished building the first site in 2013. As noted, it then took another six years for the system to pass a variety of testing and evaluation before becoming operational. At the same time, this experience with the initial example of the system has no doubt provided lessons learned that could help speed up the construction and activation of future arrays. Regardless, the announcement underscores Russia’s steadily increasing efforts to expand its force posture and overall military capabilities in and around the Arctic region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 10, 2019",What Aircraft Snuck Trump Out Of Florida On His Way To Afghanistan For Thanksgiving?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Trump made his first visit to Afghanistan on Thanksgiving. Like the other surprise war zone Presidential visits on major holidays that have come before—most notable was probably President Bush’s trip to Iraq in 2003—this was a clandestine affair. We know a good amount about how the Secret Service, the White House Military Office, and the Air Force executed the mission, but a few questions remain, including what aircraft snuck Trump out of Florida so that he could climb aboard one of two highly modified VC-25As that serve primarily as “Air Force One” at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington D.C. and head off to the land of America’s “Forever War?” Here is an account of how the mission was pulled off from CNN : Trump golfed as usual on Wednesday, then was whisked away from Mar-a-Lago just after dark in a vehicle specially brought down from Washington earlier in the day, according to two people familiar with the plans. Even some Secret Service agents working at Mar-a-Lago were unaware that Trump had left the compound, according to a law enforcement source. The President boarded a military plane at an undisclosed airport and took off at 7:20 p.m. en route to Joint Base Andrews, the military base just outside of Washington, with the special car aboard, according to the two people familiar with the plans. The 747 Trump used to travel to Florida earlier in the week remained guarded on the tarmac of Palm Beach International airport throughout the overseas outing. The military plane had just four blue leather chairs and a portable toilet on board. Only a handful of aides and one member of the traveling press pool joined Trump for that flight. After landing at Joint Base Andrews at about 9:30 p.m., Trump boarded the second Air Force One 747 — which was stowed away inside a hangar, out of sight — where the remainder of the traveling press pool was already on board. White House officials and reporters alike were stripped of their cell phones and other electronic devices before takeoff. With windows drawn and the plane’s interior lights shut off, Air Force One left at 10:08 p.m. Reporters on board did not find out where they were heading until about two hours before touching down in Afghanistan. “It’s a dangerous area and he wants to support the troops,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham explained aboard Air Force One as she briefed reporters on the President’s destination. “He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there’s a lot of people far away from their families during the holidays and we thought it’d be a nice surprise.” Trump’s plane landed at Bagram Air Base at 8:33 p.m. local time in pitch darkness. Window curtains were drawn once again and the plane’s lights were shut off to conceal Trump’s arrival. Reporters were not allowed to report on Trump’s visit until minutes before boarding Air Force One again to return to the US. Planning for the trip began weeks ahead of time, but only a very tight circle of White House officials were aware. And the White House went to new lengths to avoid arousing suspicion. On Thursday morning, the @realDonaldTrump account posted an unremarkable tweet wishing Americans a happy Thanksgiving. That tweet and several other retweets late Wednesday and early Thursday had in fact been scheduled ahead of time to avoid arousing suspicions around a President who rarely goes a dozen hours without taking to social media. At first, the aircraft the President traveled from Florida to Andrews AFB on sounds small and relatively austere, like a C-21A, at least based on its interior description. But this would have put the President out of pocket with the National Command Authority during the flight as those aircraft do not have robust and secure satellite connectivity needed to support such a mission. A C-21 would have raised the least suspicion though, as it’s basically a Learjet 35, which the President never flies on. The shadowy Gulfstream C-20Cs that were meant to be hardened command post backups for Air Force One or even E-4Bs in an emergency have been retired from service. Also, none of these aircraft can swallow up an armored sedan, which was apparently part of the cargo manifest. The aircraft used was likely a C-17A Globemaster III with a very specific VIP pallet installed known as the Senior Leader In-transit Pallet (SLIP). This would also fit the odd description of the four blue chairs and porta-potty. Connectivity with the National Command Authority would not be a problem either. McGuire AFB specifically handles these types of missions in most instances with their uniquely configured C-17s and an inventory of roll-on, roll-off systems. You can read about the various VIP configurations used by the specialized unit’s C-17s in this past piece of ours. Senior Leader In-transit Pallet (SLIP) has been around for some time, here Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is seen using it on a C-17. It consists of four “world class” first class style seats with worktables. The cost of the first unit was $415,000, or over $100,000 per seat. A VIP restroom can be included with the package and any necessary communications packages can be installed on the C-17, as well. , AP SLIP., Selectech John Kerry using the SLIP., Selectech USAF C-17s visit airports all over the United States regularly. As such, one being present not too far from Palm Beach so that it can whisk the President away wouldn’t raise any suspicions. Also, these aircraft are equipped with similar defensive systems as the VC-25A, most notably LAIRCM, and have four engines for redundancy, all things the Secret Service would have liked. One of McGuire AFB’s C-17As. , USAF The rest of the account makes perfect sense and we can add that this time the President’s VC-25A chariot masqueraded as a KC-10A Extender tanker , using the hex code of one of those aircraft on its transponder. Our friend and plane tracker extraordinaire @CivMilAir had the KC-10 following the identical route POTUS’s plane would have taken after leaving Andrews AFB on its secretive mission and its return. The route over Europe the VC-25A masquerading as a KC-10 took on its way to Afghanistan. , @CivMilAir Once Trump left Afghanistan, his VC-25A headed to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. This is a common refueling stop for return trips from the Middle East by VC-25As. But in this case, instead of spending a couple of hours on the ground to refuel, the other VC-25A that had been sitting on the tarmac in Palm Beach flew to the base. So instead of waiting, the President simply switched planes and headed home under the standard Air Force One callsign. Why exactly the switch occurred remains a mystery. Maybe Trump or is staff just wanted to get home as fast as possible. If that was the case, it cost millions of dollars extra to save those two hours. Trump exiting a BMW after a short ride to the other VC-25A during the plane-switch at Ramstein Air Base in Germany that was part of his return trip from Afghanistan. , OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images One other part of the story is also worth mentioning—how Air Force One flew direct from Andrews AFB to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. The trip has been made multiple times before by VC-25As carting other Presidents in the past. Two routes could have been taken. One is to drop down over the Middle East and then hook north over Pakistan and into Afghanistan. This is an 8,650-mile trip. The other option would have been to push across the Black Sea, over Georgia, the Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan, and then down into Afghanistan. That trip is at best 7,350 miles long. These are minimum figures really, with actual route planning considerations, more distance would be included in either route, especially since the VC-25A would not be operating as Air Force One, which always gets top priority routing and air traffic control facilitation. Example Middle East route keeping the VC-25A out of potentially hostile airspace and near friend bases is roughly 8,650 miles long., Google Earth The most direct route, without passing over less than outright friendly territory, is 7,350 miles minimum. , Google Earth Considering that we know for certain the VC-25A didn’t land on its trip over to Afghanistan, it is interesting that the type could make such a long voyage. Even the shorter route that takes the VC-25 near less than ideal territory where the US has little or no military presence is just within the stated range of the VC-25A. Of course, that range is dependent on wind conditions aloft and other weather along its route, as well as the weight of the aircraft, and so on. We also don’t know precisely the range of the nearly three-decade-old VC-25As in their current configuration, which could differ a bit from their stated range of 7,800 miles. Even if it was right on the edge, this wouldn’t leave much room for contingencies, which is hardly convenient considering the person the aircraft is transporting and the mission it is on. If it took the Persian Gulf route, which is well established in the past and where there is a huge US military presence and plenty of divert fields for contingency operations, the trip would have been beyond the stated range of the VC-25 by a sizeable margin… That is without aerial refueling. Operators in modified trucks provide security for the President’s movements around Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan., OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images The VC-25A can tank in mid-air, just like its E-4B Nightwatch cousin. You can read all about the modifications to these aircraft that make this possible in this previous piece of ours . The system is not used operationally under normal circumstances, but in a time of great uncertainty and especially following a nuclear exchange, it can be used to keep a VC-25A aloft for as long as a handful of days. The VC-25A crews practice the refueling mission using the similar 747-200 variant-based E-4Bs, which use the capability often, including when the Secretary of Defense and their press cadre are onboard. In this case, if the northern route was taken, the capability may have not been required, but it is possible that tankers were airborne in the region, just in case. If the southern route was taken, it seems like it would have to of been a necessity. Recently, when traveling east to Vietnam , Air Force One stopped in Qatar for gas, but only did so after gassing up in the United Kingdom first. This brings into question how a direct flight to Afghanistan is possible? Even the most direct route from the UK to Vietnam is substantially shorter than the distance from Washington D.C. to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. And in the case of the Vietnam trip, a similar route over the Caspian Sea wasn’t taken, one through the Middle East was instead, which is substantially longer. I have never heard that aerial refueling was part of Air Force One missions to the war-torn country, but it may be a detail the Air Force doesn’t see a reason to delve into deeply. As for future missions, from what we have gleaned, the future Air Force One aircraft , the VC-25B based on the 747-8i , will actually have less range than the VC-25As that currently execute most of the Presidential airlift missions. This is counter-intuitive because the 747-8i is capable of greater range than its 747-200 forebearer, but if the official information is indeed accurate, modifications to the 747-8i airframe will substantially offset its enhanced long-range capabilities, dropping the design requirements from 7,100 miles to 5,800 miles—both of which are already less than the current VC-25A’s stated and demonstrated range. And of course, it is worth noting the aerial refueling capability has been eliminated from the VC-25B requirements entirely. So, there you have it, another cloak and dagger Presidential airlift operation is in the books. It won’t be long until an entirely new pair of jets take over these historic operations, but a C-17 with some blue first-class seats bolted onto her cargo floor will remain timeless, at least for the foreseeable future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The SS Petersburg (T-AOT-9101), a 56-year-old Chesapeake class tanker operated by U.S. Maritime Administration, put to sea as part of a month-long exercise to demonstrate amphibious logistical capabilities that can be put to use in the Arctic environment. Arctic Expeditionary Capabilities Exercise (AECE) 2019 is mainly taking place in and around Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, but elements of it are also being executed much further south. In SS Petersburg’s case, it left its mooring in Suisun Bay off Benicia, California, to exercise its core mission set—that being moving huge quantities of fuel from sea to shore—off of Coronado, California as part of the exercise. Exactly how it goes about doing this is pretty bizarre and looks even stranger to the average landlubber, to say the least. The antique ship uses a massive device called a Single-Anchor Leg Mooring (SALM) buoy to work as a nexus of sorts that conveys fuel from ship all the way to the shore. The system’s barge-like apparatus sinks to the seafloor while leaving a buoy on the surface connecting it to the ship. Lines then carry large quantities of fuel from the ship to the barge and then to a weighted conduit that extends out all the way to shore—up to four miles away—laying along the bottom of the sea. That conduit ascends up the beach to a mobile receiving and distribution installation called a Beach Termination Unit (BTU) that is ferried ashore. The SALM can support up to four tankers offloading their fuel at once. Globalsecurity.org Globalsecurity.org At first glance, it’s an odd and complex system, but it’s also effective and well-proven. Similar counterparts exist in the commercial world, as well. Petersburg can move a staggering 1,200,000 gallons of refined petroleum to an austere beachhead in a single day. But before the SALM can be put to work and the ship’s 225,000 barrels of fuel—as well as fuel from other tankers—can be sent ashore persistently, the huge SALM barge has to get from the ship’s deck into the ocean. That’s where the whole listing maneuver comes in to play. The ship is built to be able to trim itself to list up to 15 degrees to port so that the SALM barge and buoy system can be shifted from its tilting deck platform into the ocean. The whole affair is bizarre if not downright unnerving looking: USN USN USN USN USN USN Petersburg is one of five Offshore Petroleum Discharge System (OPDS) tankers that were built in the late 1950s and early 1960s that eventually found themselves assigned to the Ready Reserve Force. The tiny fleet was divided between three classes. Today, SS Petersburg is the last of the OPDSs, with her sistership SS Chesapeake , having been taken out of service in 2009. SS Chesapeake listing 14 degrees in order to get her SALM barge into the water. The photo was taken in 2008, not long before she was put out of service for good., USN USN USN The USMC currently relies on a number of methods for moving vast amounts of fuel from ship to shore. Remember that without gas, the modern Corps can’t fight and all of its vehicles and generator-dependent systems require copious amounts of fuel on a daily basis. A single new commercial ship under Military Sealift Command’s control, the MV Vice Adm. K.R. Wheeler , was introduced in 2007 to accomplish a similar role as SS Petersburg , but it is not a tanker and relies on other vessels to supply the fuel, acting as a node for transferring it from their holds to shore. MSC The Marines also leverage Navy LCAC hovercraft and landing ships to move fuel bladders and tanks ashore. The Navy’s new Expeditionary Transfer Docks will also come in handy for quickly transferring gas to the beach as needed. For higher volume, sustained operations, the Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS) is used. It’s a far more modular and adaptable system—it can also pump fresh water—than what the SS Petersburg represents, but it isn’t as powerful and doesn’t have as long of a reach. It can be installed on different ships and can be rapidly deployed around the globe as required. Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS) in use during an exercise off of South Korea in 2017., USMC Still, even with these newer capabilities, as it sits now, the SS Petersburg’s combined tanker and fuel transfer capabilities are unique and will cease to exist within the Pentagon’s portfolio when she is finally retired sometime in the future. The Marines have posited other concepts to replace some of this capability and to augment the capabilities they already have, but no firm plans for the Pentagon to procure additional dedicated vessels, and especially anything like the Petersburg, appear to be in place at this time. A USMC document from 2016 displays a possible future concept for moving large amounts of fuel from ship to shore and then distributing it throughout an island system located within a contested environment., USMC In many ways, SS Petersburg is a relic of times that may have finally passed us by—an age when massive beach landings were still seen as a highly plausible eventuality in a time of war. Fast forward to today and even smaller beach landings are becoming far less plausible. In fact, after years of debate, those at the top of the USMC’s power structure are admitting this and redesigning their procurement and combat strategies to focus less on amphibious landing operations and more on distributed forms of warfare across the maritime environment. You can read all about this new and controversial initiative in this past feature of ours . Regardless of the highly questionable possibility of huge amphibious landings in the future, the need to move fuel from sea to shore without elaborate dock and transfer facilities hasn’t and won’t go away. In fact, the ability to do so more flexibly and numerously with smaller vessels and teams will likely define such a capability going forward, and not just for combat operations, but also for disaster relief and other contingency operations. But until the Kennedy-era SS Petersburg pumps her last gallon, in the event that gobs of fuel are needing to be transferred from the sea to the beach, it’s still among the very best ships, if not the best ship for the job—even though it looks like it is about to sink while doing it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 17, 2019",Vital Logistics Ships Will Be Without Critical U.S. Navy Escorts In A Major Conflict,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what may be one of the most important reports I have read in a long time, David Larter of Defense News lays out an incredibly inconvenient reality for Military Sealift Command and its fleet of cargo ships and the Merchant Marines that operate them—in the next big conflict they are likely to be left to fend for themselves without any protection from U.S. Navy vessels. This is an especially troubling proposition considering roughly 90 percent of the Army’s and Marine Corps’ materiel will be relegated to transport on the high seas during such a crisis. In Larter’s piece, which you can and should read in full here , he talked at length with Mark Buzby, a retired Rear Admiral who now heads up the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration. His comments were both frank and unnerving: “The Navy has been candid enough with Military Sealift Command and me that they will probably not have enough ships to escort us. It’s: ‘You’re on your own; go fast, stay quiet.’ … Adm. Mewbourn at Military Sealift Command and I have talked a lot about this and we have been trying to get the word out to people that we are going to have to do things differently… Turn your navigation lights off, turn your [Automatic Identification System] off, turn your radars off, tell your crews not to use their cell phones — all those [Emissions Condition] things that we in the Navy are familiar with that are completely foreign to a merchant mariner and are seen as an imposition. … But it harkens back to some of the hard lessons we learned in World War II where in 1942 the Germans were sinking us left and right. Even some of the equipment that’s on ships now automatically transmits data… We put new cargo-control consoles on our Kaiser -class oilers at MSC, and one of the things we discovered soon after was that those things are talking constantly. … The last bullet point on one of the slides is ‘Learn how to swim… It’s to that point. There’s not going to be a bunch of destroyers around us as we take those ships over there. We’re going to be hitting the sea buoy, cranking it up and going hell-bent for leather, hoping to stay undetected.” You are probably thinking ‘but one of the Navy’s most important jobs is supposed to be keeping critical sea lanes open and to provide convoy duty to support a war effort?’ You are right, but that’s not where the Navy’s priorities have lied over the last two and a half decades or so. It’s a density and priority problem. The Navy does not have enough surface combatant with particular capabilities to fight a high-end conflict and provide convoy duty for what would be a massive sealift operation. And clearly, America’s would-be opponents have recognized this Achilles heel, just as they have with vulnerabilities in U.S. combat doctrine in the air . Simply put, it’s much easier to kill a brigade of armor by sinking it in the middle of an ocean than facing it head-on. Military Sealift Command fleet as of January 2018., MSC This truth also fits with what many of us have been pounding away at for the better part of a decade or more—that the Navy’s misguided investment in Littoral Combat Ships could end up being a very bloody and strategically damning mistake. These lightly armed and even more lightly armored vessels have suffered from low availability rates , are now only capable of focusing on one key mission and lack any sort of area air defense capability at all, not to mention the range and seakeeping of more traditional surface combatants. In other words, the Navy needed a modern multi-role frigate that can handle escort duty during a time of war yesterday. A ship that can tackle lower volume threats below, on, and above the surface of the water and persist over long ranges and in heavy sea states. That ship is finally in the works now under the FFG(X) program that intends to field its first operational frigates by around 2025. The Navy should put even more emphasis on speeding it up and expanding the program in order to reach better economies of scale that will make it as affordable as possible to procure large numbers of hulls. America’s logistics navy provides the lifeblood to the U.S. Navy’s fighting fleet and the other services rely on it heavily as well to move their gear over huge distances, especially during a crisis. , USN Having multi-role capable escorts is key as it’s not as if the threat to maritime convoys will come from one domain exclusively. Submarines may pose the most traditional danger when it comes to moving lines of supply vessels across the open ocean, but they don’t just launch torpedoes or lay mines. They can also fire anti-ship cruise missiles and some of them can sling dozens of them at a time. As such, a single adversary platform can represent a layered threat. Aircraft and surface combatants are also clearly an issue. As such, an escort ship has to be able to counter a multitude of threats that could attack suddenly from a number of vectors, not just one. This means anti-submarine, anti-air, and anti-surface warfare capabilities are needed, otherwise, multiple assets would have to be assigned to do the same mission. In addition, there aren’t enough multi-billion dollar destroyers to fulfill the demands the Navy already has, let alone those that will be required during a time of war. Assigning these high-end combat ships to convoy duty isn’t just wasteful, it will likely be impossible. DoD Larter also points out that manpower is also a major issue that could leave America’s total force with a gutted logistical train during a time of war, he writes: “Today, the Maritime Administration estimates that to operate both the surge sealift ships — the 46 ships in the Ready Reserve Force and the 15 ships in the MSC surge force — and the roughly 60 U.S.-flagged commercial ships in the Maritime Security Program available to the military in a crisis, the pool of fully qualified mariners is just barely enough. They need 11,678 mariners to man the shops, and the pool of available, active mariners is 11,768. That means in a crisis every one of them would need to show up for the surge, according to a recent MARAD report to Congress. In contrast, the U.S. had about 55,000 active mariners in the years prior to World War II, with that number swelling to more than 200,000 at the height of the war, according to most sources. That means that significant losses among the available pool of mariners would likely dissuade some from volunteering (bad) and would mean the loss of mariners with critical skills needed to operate the fleet for months or even years in a major contingency (worse). And even without losses, MARAD estimates the country is about 1,800 mariners short if any kind of rotational presence is needed.” He also goes on to discuss some very important lessons learned during WWII and how we may be setting ourselves up for logistical failure in a future conflict. MSC We reached out to David to get a bit more background on how he came to reporting on this critical but nearly invisible issue, this is what he told us: “The series I’m working on has been something I’ve been chipping away at over a number of months. It struck me that if the National Defense Strategy calls for preparing for a war with China or Russia or both, the US wouldn’t get very far without a robust sealift capability. Turns out, when you dig into the issue, the US has a serious strategic liability on its hands both in terms of the available workforce for a major surge and, like much of the rest of the military, in aging platforms in need of modernization. When you layer in the fact that the U.S. Navy is much smaller than it was in the Cold War and would be vital in opening up the sea lanes to move this equipment, responding to a Russian move in Europe or Chinese move in Asia would be very slow going. If the pace of war is speeding up, as CNO often says, this is one place where it seems the US could find itself in a logjam.” Yesterday, David also reported on the not so great state of Military Sealift Command’s fleet—a significant portion of which still run on steam power —making the possibility of even sustaining a logistics chain across an ocean all that more dubious. In addition, in a tweet he reminded us that airlift is not an alternative as it has major limitations, even when it comes to the USAF’s unique ability to maintain an air-bridge between two disparate locales: He is completely right. Take Operation Airborne Dragon in 2003. It took 30 C-17 sorties to bring in just five Abrams tanks, five Bradleys fighting vehicles, and a battalion command post, along with the personnel to man those vehicles and facilities. Keep in mind that a single tank company has 14 Abrams main battle tanks. In addition, facilities to even land those aircraft may be next to non-existent during the opening weeks or even months of a conflict—another similar hard reality the USAF is now finally coming to terms with . In addition, Sea bases can pop up virtually anywhere to work as a nexus between MSC’s largest logistics ships and the shore. Beyond the nuts and bolts of the issue, the bigger picture here seems to be that the Pentagon is in denial of the realities surrounding its ability to rapidly move material across the globe and especially into semi-contested environments. These are supply and demand issues as much as there are survivability ones. The good news is there are solutions to this problem, which includes pumping more funds into the military’s sealift ecosystem and accelerating and widening procurement of FFG(X), but it also could include providing some organic defenses to Military Sealift Command associated ships themselves. Containerized weapon systems are especially attractive for such applications. Some Military Sealift Command ships had Phalanx close-in weapon systems, but most, if not all now do not. Installing a more advanced but modular point air defense capability, such a containerized version of SeaRAM , would provide a robust last-ditch defense against aerial and some surface threats. Anti-submarine warfare is a much tougher nut to crack, but even modular torpedo defense systems, both active and passive, could be deployed in a similar role but to counter attacks from below the waves. Some of MSC’s most advanced ships have Nixie decoys , but others do not. Some of MSC’s combat logistics ships, like USNS Lewis And Clark shown above, have Nixie decoys and provisions for Phalanx systems, but the majority of the vehicle and cargo haulers do not., USN Finally, electronic warfare can go a long way in providing an affordable screen against certain kinds of attacks and from being detected by the enemy in the first place, all without actually arming cargo ships with additional kinetic weaponry. In fact, just the situational awareness the latest maritime electronic warfare systems provide could go a long way when it comes to MSC ships’ survivability, as avoiding threats is maybe the best defense of all. Expendable decoys could also be paired with an electronic warfare system, giving these big vessels a much better chance of averting an anti-ship missile strike than they have now. It’s also worth noting that the Navy has already been eyeing outfitting some of its logistics ships with bolt-on weapon systems , including cruise missiles, as part of a ‘distributed lethality’ model of operations. But adding offensive punch to some of these ships could also work as a valuable deterrent. USNS PFC Dewayne T. Williams (T-AK 3009) uses the Improved Navy Lighterage System Causeway Ferry system to move vehicles to shore during an exercise off the Southern California coast., USN Hopefully, Larter’s report will help to push the Department of Defense towards taking such a glaring weakness seriously. Sealift may not be sexy, but without it, America stands little chance in a protracted peer-state conflict overseas. They say logistics wins wars. If that is so, then the current status quo seems like a great way to lose one.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 31, 2018",Setting The Record Straight On Why Fighter Jets Can’t All Simply Fly Away To Escape Storms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been leading the coverage on the state of aircraft left behind after Hurricane Michael made a direct strike on the highly important Tyndall Air Force Base. We have posted pictures showing QF-16s, Mu-2s, and yes, F-22s, sitting among the rubble inside badly damaged hangars at the base. The USAF has stated that aircraft were left behind, with unofficial figures being reported that range from three to 18 of the precious super fighters riding out the storm on site. Even though I repeatedly explained why not all aircraft can fly off in advance of a storm’s arrival, I have been inundated with tweets, Facebook messages, emails, and comments ranging from people demanding to know how this could have happened to being outraged that the commanders at the base didn’t see that all of the planes flew out and that they should face stiff punishments for their actions. Some even claimed they should have been flown out on transport planes. These are naive and in some cases absurd statements that are totally divorced from the reality of tactical jet operations. Here’s why. At modern fighter is not a Honda Accord. You don’t just hop in it and drive it around for months until you finally have to take it for a one-hour oil change when the light comes on. If anything, they are far more akin to high-end sports cars that require a lot of expensive TLC to keep operating. The F-22, in particular, is more analogous to an exotic supercar or even a high-end race car than anything else. It requires dozens of hours of maintenance for every single flight hour and deep maintenance can take days or even many weeks to accomplish, depending on what is needed to be done and availability of spare parts, which can be scarce. An F119 engine is replaced on an F-22. , USAF On top of some aircraft being sidelined for extended periods of time for repairs, others have to go through periodic planned servicing, discreet component inspections, and invasive phase inspections, the latter of which sees the aircraft largely disassembled before being arduously put back together and flight tested before returning it to the active flight line after all its issues, or ‘gripes,’ are worked out. In other words, many of these operations are not ones you can simply stop and reverse to rapidly generate the aircraft into a flying condition in a matter of a day or two—in some cases, not even close. There are always a number of aircraft going through these planned maintenance intervals, that way a squadron’s inventory can remain fairly predictable given the demands being placed upon it. So it is not uncommon to have at least a handful of a unit’s aircraft incapable of flying due to foreseen maintenance, let alone unforeseen issues. That number can actually grow higher based on the type, the age of the aircraft, and the general readiness status of the aircraft’s community overall. An airman services an F-22. , USAF Take the 142nd Fighter Wing in Portland, Oregon—one of the best F-15 operators on the planet. They had a snap readiness drill earlier in the year that challenged them to get every jet airborne they could within 24 hours. This resulted in 13 aircraft taking to the skies, including the unit’s alert aircraft, which was an awesome achievement they should be proud of. The wing has 21 aircraft assigned to it in total. As I mentioned earlier, some military aircraft communities are better able to cope with a sudden demand to generate flyable aircraft than others. If you have been around a USMC or Navy Hornet squadron that is in a low-readiness period you will see a lot of aircraft missing parts and sitting zombie-like on the flight line or in the unit’s maintenance hangars. Cannibalization of airframes for parts, and in some cases not even to benefit the same unit’s aircraft, is a very common reality. You can read about this first hand in this past feature of ours . USAF This sorry state of affairs is slowly improving for the Navy and Marine Corps, but it still has a long way to go before reaching traditional readiness targets, let alone a new and arguably fantastical one Defense Secretary Mattis just set for them . The USAF’s 5th generation F-22 and F-35 fleets also suffer from similar parts shortages and logistical logjams. An aircraft that had critical components taken off of it to help keep another aircraft flying is not that likely to be able to wing it out of an air base in a matter of a couple days as a storm moves into the region. The F-22 fleet, in particular, sits at the lowest readiness rate across the USAF fast-jet inventory. There are a number of contributing factors to this, including the type’s short production run that pretty much everyone regrets in hindsight . But as of 2017, the F-22 community as a whole struggled to meet a 50 percent mission capable rate. Their legacy fighter predecessors fared better at generally above 70 percent. USAF So no, the commanders at Tyndall AFB—the home of F-22 training and a base with 55 of the stealth fighters on hand, as well as the home to many other aircraft—can’t simply click their flight boots together and magically get 55 F-22s in the air. And the very idea that those that lead elite fighter units don’t care enough about preserving the jets they have under their purview is simply outrageous. Trust me, anyone at a command level in the USAF fighter community cares plenty about their aircraft. If you think otherwise then you haven’t spent much time around these types of individuals or the culture they operate in. USAF But you know what commanders generally care more about than their jets? The lives of the humans under their command. This is not some abstract challenge to see how many jets can fly in a matter of few days. The crew chiefs, airframe technicians, pilots, egress shop people, accountants, operations folks, and every one of the hundreds of other people that make up a squadron all have lives outside of their jobs and families to protect. It seems as if some think that somehow a catastrophic storm doesn’t impact those who work in the air combat business. They have to evacuate just like any other person in a community. They can’t be sitting around tinkering on F-22s as a category four storm crashes into their hangar. They also have to support the crazy logistical operation of evacuating the aircraft that can fly, which is no easy feat. There is only so much capacity in a very finite amount of time that these individuals can provide during a hurricane evacuation scenario. At a certain point, they too have to rush to safety with their loved ones. And for very good reason. 100 percent of the housing on Tyndall and infrastructure to support daily life was destroyed by Michael. It’s all gone, and yet nobody died. You can view highly detailed imagery of the base here to see what it looks like in Michael’s aftermath. Just some of the devastation seen in high-resolution NOAA aerial imagery of the base. , NOAA As for many of the childish notions that many have thrown around over the last 24 hours with great authority—like flying aircraft away on transports or wheeling them out on trucks—they don’t help inform the public of the realities of these types of evacuation operations. No, these planes aren’t just Lego sets that you can take apart and pour into a C-5. Removing wings on an F-22? That is a massive undertaking, let alone getting a C-5 in and loading it up to fly away to someplace. Once again, limited capacity in a limited timespan, and that is a long-lead type of project. Throwing jets on flatbed trucks? People don’t realize how large of a flying machine a Raptor is. They are roughly 44 feet wide, 62 feet long, and weigh over 43,000lbs. They are not something you just throw on pop’s flatbed and skidaddle out of dodge. Nor are they made to be transported that way in the first place. And to where? You are talking about a highly sensitive asset packed with classified material. Its skin treatment alone presents a national secret risk. These aircraft are supposed to sit in last minute hurricane traffic heading somewhere as they hog up multiple lanes? The whole notion is ridiculous. And if they can’t seek refuge in time, you have a flying machine strapped to a flatbed. Good luck with that. Shipping a fighter via transport is a big and laborious undertaking. , Public Domain I even had people say they should fly them off on the backs of NASA 747s like the Space Shuttle. First off, those 747s no longer exist. Second, they only flew two types of aircraft in their entire history—the Shuttle and the X-45C . The Shuttle only flew after an amazing amount of engineering work and study and the X-45C also had to go through an extensive process. Just loading and unloading these craft took a special crane system to be erected and special mounting hardware. Anyways, I am not going to spend any more time on that fantasy. Tyndall F-22s and T-38 aggressors pack into one of the base’s main hangars to ride out Hurricane Alberto . That hangar was clearly not capable of taking the brunt of category 4 hurricanes., USAF So let’s debate the logic of basing these types of assets in major hurricane zones. Let’s debate building at least one large hangar facility on at-risk bases that can withstand Mother Nature’s most power onslaughts so that unflyable aircraft and critical gear have a place to safely ride out a storm. Let’s also debate the readiness of our air combat fleets and the service’s funding priorities in relation to those issues. But claiming that it is an outrage that every plane at Tyndall Air Force Base didn’t flock to safety at a moment’s notice is a sign of ignorance on this topic more than a hot take rooted in fact. Yes, F-22s are a woefully scarce and finite commodity within the USAF. Any loss, or even damage , to a Raptor is a significant event that has a real impact on the total force. But there is no getting around it, there will likely be substantial losses of not just Raptors but also T-38A Talon aggressors and Mu-2 radar operator training aircraft , not to mention QF-16s, due to Michael. When it comes to the QF-16s, the USAF spent millions per airframe turning those jets into full-scale aerial targets (FSATs) fairly recently. They can fly for years with or without a pilot in the cockpit after going through that conversion, so losing a number of them is not just some trivial thing and those airframes are badly needed for critical weapons testing and development purposes. The harsh truth is that fighter aircraft are not 737s, they don’t just reliably churn out hours upon hours of flight time without a major issue. They are finicky, maintenance intensive, and comparatively unreliable thoroughbred fighting machines that spend far more time on the ground broken than in the air—or even being capable of being in the air in the F-22’s case. And the more complex they are the less consistent they are operationally speaking. So save the outrage over F-22s left behind at Tyndall and let’s discuss solutions to what will clearly be an increasingly common and crushingly expensive issue to contend with in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Air Force One Has This Unique Navigator’s Cockpit Station That’s Unlike Any Other 747,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The two Boeing VC-25As that are often referred to generally as ‘Air Force One’—which is really the callsign of any Air Force aircraft when the President is onboard—are incredibly capable and highly customized flying machines. From featuring one of the most elaborate flying communications systems in the world to being covered with directed-energy turrets that blind incoming heat-seeking missiles, these aircraft have taken the 747-200 design they are based on to the absolute max. And still, after decades of reporting, multiple books written and documentaries filmed, these flying symbols of America’s might can still surprise. Case in point, last night I was watching the National Geographic documentary Inside Air Force One, when something briefly shown in the aircraft’s cockpit grabbed my attention. I have seen the film before, it’s fabulous and they have continued to update it over the years, but never before did I notice a feature I had previously never known existed on these historic planes. The VC-25As cockpits are configured for four crew—a pilot, co-pilot, engineer and navigator. The pilot, copilot and engineer’s stations have been shown for years, but apparently, a fourth console that is totally unique to these highly customized 747s is installed in what appears to be an enlarged rear cockpit area. VC-25A over the Statue of Liberty., USAF The 747 was designed originally for three crew, with a set of extra jump seats being arranged on the other side of the cockpit, across from the engineer’s cluttered instrument station. The next-generation 747-400 model that followed the first generation of 747s—the VC-25As are part of the classic 747 family as they were based on an advanced 747-200 configuration—cut the crew down to just a pilot and co-pilot with the help of modern avionics. On the VC-25A, a jump seat is still installed across from the engineer’s station, but behind that is a large console and a seating position facing forward that is purpose-built for a navigator. Check out the screengrabs below: Screencap Screencap The console has all the things one would find on an advanced navigational station, including digital navigational display, radar and barometric pressure altimeters, weather radar display, flight management system, DME-VOR, and other instruments and an area to inspect charts and do table-top work., Screencap The only other 747 that has something similar, at least that I know of, is the E-4B National Airborne Command Center , but that configuration doesn’t put the navigator facing forward in something of an open bridge-like layout like the one seen on the VC-25A. After doing some searching, I was able to find some video that gives another glimpse of this station and of the cockpit layout as a whole. Check out the clip below starting right at the 2:30 mark and keep your eyes peeled, it goes by fast: The need for the navigator aboard the VC-25A is likely multi-fold. Spreading out the crew’s workload helps for what already is pretty much the most demanding and sensitive airlift mission in the world. Also, back in the 1980s when the VC-25s were ordered, automation and ease of navigation weren’t anywhere near what they are today. But above all else, it probably has the most to do with the possibility that a VC-25 aircrew could find themselves flying in post-nuclear exchange skies—ones in which traditional navigational, air traffic control, and even weather tracking assistance may be all but non-existent. Being able to make it to a continuity of government site or to at least regroup with friendly forces would become a critical and highly challenging task. A rare shot of Air Force One and Trump Force One in Scotland, AP The fact that Air Force One is as much a hardened flying command post as an airborne West Wing, being able to quickly make navigational changes on the fly could be key to aircraft and its VVIP passengers survival during a major crisis. The ability to evade conventional threats pointed out by the aircraft’s electronic surveillance and countermeasure systems officers alone while still keeping a precise handle of exactly where the aircraft is in time and space would be essential during such an event. It will be interesting to see what the crew concept is for the VC-25A replacement aircraft that are based on the far more modern cousin of the 747-200, the 747-8i . These aircraft are already designated VC-25B. The 747-8i only requires a pilot and co-pilot to operate, so it’s possible that the engineer position would be combined with the navigator’s position, or both could be eliminated entirely, although that’s doubtful. 747-8i like the ones that will replace the two existing VC-25As., Boeing A similar, but even wider scope replacement program is just spinning up for the four C-32As that are largely referred to as ‘Air Force Two,’ but are used for Presidential airlift missions into smaller airports or when a VC-25A is not available. The VH-3D and VH-60N ‘Marine One’ helicopter fleet is also being replaced with the new type designated VH-92 . That is slated to reach operational status in 2020. I highly recommend you watch Inside Air Force One, which you can do so for free right now on National Geographic’s website linked here . It’s an outstanding look at the VC-25 and its mission. The way I stumbled on the film again is I had tuned in an hour early by accident to watch to another National Geographic documentary—this one on the Secret Service—that premiered last evening. That two-hour film, named United States Secret Service: On the Front Line, was absolutely jaw-dropping . It went far more in-depth and unveiled way more operational details than anything I have ever seen on the subject before. It too is an absolute must watch. I talk a lot about all the labor and cost that goes into just moving the President from one place to another and keeping them safe in general . These two documentaries combined really convey this bewildering reality to an almost unsettling degree. So there you have it, the full story of the Air Force One’s four crew cockpit and the navigator’s station that looks a bit more like it belongs on a starship than in an aircraft originally design from the designed in the late 1960s.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",China’s Lunar Satellites Could Stab U.S. Early Warning Satellites In The Back,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China continues to push forward with its ambitious lunar base program, one that supposedly aims for a manned lunar landing by around 2030. But there are emerging concerns that the satellites being sent to support this initiative could also have a far darker purpose—attacking the Pentagon’s most critical space-based assets that live in geosynchronous orbit, beginning roughly 22,000 miles above the Earth’s surface. These include strategic surveillance platforms, like America’s space-based infrared early warning satellite network that detects and tracks ballistic missile launches during their early boost stages and possibly beyond. Defense One’s Patrick Tucker broke the story after noting comments made by Jeff Gossel, the top intel engineer within the Space and Missile Analysis Group that reports to the USAF’s National Air And Space Intelligence Center, at an Air Force Association gathering that took place last Friday. Gossel said that China’s Queqiao relay satellite, part of its larger Chang’e 4 lunar exploration mission to the dark side of the moon, took a ‘lunar swing-by’ path on its way to its final destination at Lagrangian Point Two. He is concerned that the satellite, or future satellites like it, may have a secondary mission that could include supporting craft that are anti-satellite weapons, not lunar surveyors or landing craft. Gossel described the potential threat as such: “You could fly some sort of a weapon around the moon and it comes back — it could literally come at [objects] in GEO… And we would never know because there is nothing watching in that direction… Why do you need a relay satellite flying around L2? So you can communicate with something that’s going to land on the other side of the moon—or so you can fly around the other side of the moon? And what would that mean for our assets at GEO?” CASIC Gossel notes that the actual threat from Chang’e 4 remains small, but that it’s his job to identify these types of potential threats so that Pentagon can be better prepared in potential future conflicts. China and Russia are racing to develop new anti-satellite capabilities. Just last month, we broke the story of what appeared to be a new Russian direct-ascent, air-launched, anti-satellite weapon, and it is just one facet of a layered anti-satellite approach Russia is taking when it comes to countering U.S. capabilities in space. China is also doing the same. You can read all about these emerging threats in this past feature of ours . It is clear that America’s high-flying strategic satellites in geosynchronous orbit are increasingly vulnerable to attack. These include the aforementioned early warning satellites that serve a crucial role when it comes to ensuring America’s strategic deterrent. They not only warn of potential incoming ballistic missile attacks, but are sensitive enough to detect other significant heat-related events within Earth’s atmosphere. Other intelligence-gathering spacecraft, as well as weather, communications, navigational satellites, and more, that leverage the ability to stare persistently at one part of the globe also call the orbital region home. In total, roughly 600 satellites are up there, but not all of them are functioning. While some may outright discount the possibility that China’s lunar space program is being used to also develop key military applications, I would tell them to look at all the other work being done in the anti-satellite space by China, much of which has to do with countering satellites in lower orbits. The ability to launch a sudden attack from behind on multiple strategic satellites that are built to provide early warning themselves seems like a highly relevant capability for the PLA to possess. Future space-based sensors that are now among the USAF’s highest priorities, such as those that can track ‘colder objects’ as they race through or above the upper atmosphere during the mid-course part of their flight, most notably hypersonic weapons, will call this orbital band home. Cmglee/Wikicommons This, and China’s deep investment in hypersonic weaponry , in particular, is likely to press Beijing’s anti-satellite programs into high-gear. The Pentagon is open and clear about the fact that they see space-based sensors as the way to detect, track, and effectively counter hypersonic threats . And they are putting their money where their mouth is, with the objective of fielding the first of these satellites by early 2021 . Possessing the ability to swat these sensors down during a conflict would be highly important to the PLA, not just when it comes to sapping America of its panoptic situational awareness, but also just to ensure China’s own high-end weaponry can be successfully employed. If anything else, this also serves as yet another reminder of how America’s most unguarded flank is space. It also adds credence to initiatives that aim at moving away from large, expensive, hard-to-build and largely vulnerable satellites, to constellations of rapidly deployable smaller ones that are far more resilient when it comes to anti-satellite weapons attacks. https://youtube.com/watch?v=DIXoUzOgFV8 The very idea that the U.S. could have some of its most important space-based eyes suddenly poked out, leaving commanders in the dark when it comes to strategic events across an entire region of the globe, is and should be troubling. The Chinese have proven to be incredibly cunning when it comes to precisely identifying the Pentagon’s warfighting weak spots and exploiting them . Knowing just how much U.S. forces depend on space for their asymmetric combat advantage makes investing in elaborate capabilities to deny such an advantage make total sense. The fact that China could potentially be doing so while also pushing forward a moon shot initiative is a win-win, both in terms of deniability and in terms of return on investment. With all the talk now being that the U.S. and China have entered into a new Cold War , only expect more suspicious and potentially ‘dual use’ Chinese space exploration initiatives in the future.

Douglas Healey and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",Tales Of Nuclear Cruiser USS Long Beach From A Sailor Who Built His Career Aboard Her,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the most enigmatic ships of the entire Cold War period is the one-off USS Long Beach (CGN-9). She was the U.S. Navy’s first nuclear-powered surface combatant and was absolutely packed with the latest and greatest gear America had to offer when she was commissioned into service on September 9th, 1961. She looked like no other ship the world had ever seen before and she definitely had her quirks. One man, in particular, served numerous tours aboard Long Beach throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with the ship acting as a 721 foot-long steel springboard that catapulted him through the ranks and eventually to the position of Force Master Chief for the Commander, Naval Surface Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet. That man is Douglas Healey. So this is the story of a ship, but also of the journey of a man that built his reputation largely on the deck plates of that vessel during one of the most interesting times in the U.S. Navy’s history. So without further adieu, in Master Chief Healey’s own words, let’s begin: The family business My dad was a career Navy man. He had enlisted in the Navy out of high school during World War II under a program known as a “kiddie cruise” which allowed 17-year-olds to serve up to just prior to their 21st birthday. He got out of the Navy but stayed a drilling reservist. After I was born, he went back on active duty. I remember him serving on USS Bigelow , a Forrest Sherman class destroyer homeported in Mayport, Florida from 1960 to 1965, then at the Navy Supply Corps School in Athens, Georgia from 1965 to 1967. After that, he served two back-to-back nine-month tours in Da Nang, Vietnam with the Seabees. Following Vietnam, he was on the pre-commissioning crew of USS Gray (DE-1054), then director of Storekeeper Class C School at Naval Training Center (NTC) San Diego. He went back to sea duty on USS Dixie (AD-14) for three years and then his final tour was at Fleet Assistance Group, San Diego. He died while on active duty during this tour. He was a Master Chief Storekeeper (E-9) at the time of his passing in April of 1980.  I was an Electrician’s Mate-1 (E6) at the time, part of PCU (Pre-commissioning Unit) for USS Arkansas (CGN-41). Going Navy I graduated from high school in San Diego in June 1972 and attended Mesa Community College for a while, but wasn’t ready. So, I looked at what my best options were for receiving an education and training. After checking out both the Air Force and Navy, I decided to enlist in the Navy’s Nuclear Propulsion Program as I felt it offered me the most interesting and challenging training. I’d had three years of Junior ROTC in high school so after about a week or so I was instructing my company in the manual of arms when I was abruptly ordered to report to the battalion commander’s office. When I arrived, I requested permission to enter and when I entered, my father was sitting there drinking coffee with the battalion commander. I was able to share a cup of coffee with them and remember thinking “this isn’t going to be too tough.” Afterward, my company commander wanted to know why I hadn’t informed him that my father was a Senior Chief Petty Officer stationed at the NTC. I mistakenly told him “I didn’t think it was important.” That was a major error in judgment to say the least! I received some extra ‘military instruction’ that evening. I finished boot camp as a company honor man and with scholastic honors. SKCS Healey and EM3 Healey—father and son—both sailors in the U.S. Navy., Doug Healey Harnessing naval power Prior to Electrician’s Mate Class A school, I attended Basic Electricity/Electronics school at NTC San Diego. It was a self-paced course of 14 modules about electrical components, Ohm’s Law and other required knowledge for electricians and electronic technicians. I finished the course in just under a week. In Electrician’s Mate Class A school we learned about motors generators, shipboard distribution and troubleshooting electrical systems. In order to continue on to Nuclear Power School at Mare Island, I had to finish in the upper 50 percentile of my class. If I correctly remember, I was number two or three. At the end of Class A school, I was advanced to EM3 (E4). At Nuclear Power School we learned about the theory of reactor design and operation as well as learning about radiation and rudimentary chemistry. At Nuclear Power Prototype Training, I was assigned to the S5G reactor prototype (designed as the USS Narwhal ‘s power plant) where we learned the ‘hands-on’ operation of a naval nuclear reactor. We learned operations and maintenance and we also learned how to react during simulated casualty operations. I was one of the first Electrician’s Mates to qualify at S5G. There were two other prototypes at the site, an A1W (the USS Enterprise prototype) and an S1W (the USS Nautilus prototype). S5G reactor at Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. , USN Welcome aboard America’s largest nuclear cruiser, USS Long Beach After qualifying, I requested orders to a fast attack submarine (SSN) out of San Diego since my father-in-law (at the time) offered me enough furniture to fill an apartment if I could get stationed there. I received orders to a nuclear ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in New London, Connecticut instead. A classmate received orders to USS Long Beach and wanted to go to New England so we asked our advisers to see if we could swap our orders. After the order swap was approved, the sub-qualified sailors at S5G facility gave me a hard time constantly. I arranged with Long Beach’s Engineering Officer to report directly to Long Beach and then start my transfer leave in order to start my sea duty counter 30 days earlier. I wanted to apply for the Navy’s Enlisted Science Education Program (NESEP) which required a minimum of one year’s sea duty in order to be eligible. Unfortunately, when I reached the one year of sea duty point, the program requirements had changed and a full sea tour was required (four years in my case). When I reported aboard Long Beach at NAS Coronado, I looked up at the ship in awe. Here was the last ‘true’ cruiser built by the Navy. At 721 feet long, over 17,000 tons displacement and a crew of over 1,100 Sailors and Marines (there was a Marine detachment embarked), she was a truly impressive ship! USN My first impression as a crew member was of responsibilities of leadership. Supplies were being loaded and a ‘working party’ was called away. One of the division’s sailors failed to show up for the duty and the division-leading Petty Officer, an E6, was ordered to take the missing man’s place. The First Class Petty Officer was not the least bit happy and this impressed upon me to make absolutely sure that I did not disappoint my Leading Petty Officer! Navy ships have unique smells, sounds, and sensations. Every time I set foot on a ship, the memories of shipboard life and the unique routine that goes along with it come back to me. My first job on Long Beach was to qualify on the reactor plant. This involved completing basic engineering qualifications, damage control qualifications and my electrical watch station qualifications, both as a roving electrician and for monitoring the ship’s electrical distribution system. Long Beach had six 2500 kW turbine generators and two 1000 kW emergency diesel generators. After completing basic engineering qualifications, I was assigned to the electrical safety shop, ensuring the portable electrical tools were checked for safety prior to issuance. This was a challenging time in the Navy. It was going through the drawdown of the post-Vietnam era and there was a severe shortage of leadership personnel at the First and Second Class Petty Officer levels (E6 and E5). When the lighting shop needed a leading Petty Officer, the E Division Leading Petty Officer looked to the senior Second Class Petty Officers, but none wanted the position. I was one of the most junior Second Class Petty Officers but I asked if I could take the position and I was appointed as the leading Petty Officer in charge of the 115-volt distribution outside of the propulsion plant with 13 sailors reporting to me in addition to standing my watches in the engineering plant. USS Long Beach . Note the SCANFAR phased array radar system mounted on the sides of her ‘box’ superstructure. , USN In a class of her own Long Beach had two pressurized water reactors, two main engines, twin screws and twin rudders. For weapons, she had two twin rail launchers forward for Terrier missiles (and could carry over 100 of them), amidships she had an ASROC (anti-submarine rocket system) eight-cell launcher with reloading capability and two five-inch 38-caliber guns. Long Beach was originally designed without any guns and rumor has it that during sea trials someone asked one of the NAVSEA representatives what the ship would do if a patrol boat came up and shot at them and it was decided to install the five-inch guns. On the fantail, Long Beach had the Talos missile system . The Talos missiles, which could be nuclear armed, were about the size of a telephone pole and would ‘sit’ on the launch rail building up thrust before taking off. I was told that while on station off of Vietnam, Long Beach shot down a North Vietnamese MiG with one. My most prominent memory of Talos is from a missile exercise before our 1978 deployment. We were to launch one for some other ships to shoot at but the missiles were quite old at that point. After we launched the missile, a fin fell off and the missile pulled a three-G turn and came back at the ship! It spectacularly self-destructed as ordered from the launch console in Combat Information Center. Long Beach firing a Talos., USN In addition to the active measures for defense, the ship also carried chaff to confuse radars, SLQ-32 electronic warfare equipment and cryptologic equipment.  Since she was built as a true cruiser, Long Beach had a flag bridge and quarters to carry an admiral and his staff. This almost got me in big trouble as I was told to move some 115-volt receptacles in the flag conference room. I hit my head while working under the conference table, swore and wondered what kind of idiot wanted so many outlets under the table. I looked around and saw khakis with shiny black shoes and heard “I only wanted one at the end of the table where I sit” from the admiral in charge of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1 (we were the flagship). In 1987, we were deployed to the Arabian Gulf area during the Iraq-Iran War. We had the Commander of the Joint Task Force Middle East embarked. We had picked him up at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean around Labor Day and were to transfer him and his staff to the group relieving us (with the USS Iowa ) but he didn’t want us to leave as no other ship had the flag spaces we had. Fortunately, he was over-ruled and we were allowed to leave the operation area after over 100 days continuously at sea. Another unique thing is that Long Beach had an elevator that went from the main deck up to the 010 level (main bridge). It could stop on the 02 level (flag spaces), 03 level (CO’s in-port cabin) and the 04 level as well (flag bridge & flag plot, a mini CIC). During my 1st tour, the CO, Captain Schrader, had us secure power to it prior to getting underway. It was an electrician’s nightmare and broke down frequently. Every time we pulled into port in Subic Bay, we had workers over fiddling with it. On my second tour, I don’t remember a lot of problems with it but most of us wouldn’t ride in it because we didn’t want to get stuck in it. As a side note, with an enlisted crew of about 1,000, there was only seating for about 300 sailors in the enlisted mess decks at one time. As a result, you learned to eat fast and get up so a shipmate could sit down and eat. USN The best late 1950s Cold War technology money could buy Long Beach had several very complex systems. The Talos missile system and the SCANFAR radar system were just a couple of them. I was told that one time they powered it up in port and garage doors were opening and closing throughout the greater San Diego area and that it interfered with air traffic control radar at the San Diego airport. Generally, we couldn’t turn it on until we were at least three miles away from an airport for safety reasons. It was one powerful radar system and we had a huge contingent of Navy Electronics Technicians (ETs) embarked aboard to maintain it. When it was running it required two 200kW motor-generator sets running in parallel to provide the 400Hz power the radar demanded. We knew it as the AN/SPS-32/33 radar system. Supposedly when being built, Long Beach was ready before Enterprise and received the ‘billboard’ arrays intended for the Big E. Long Beach under construction., USN Besides 400Hz power, the system took a lot of 60Hz power and cooling water as well. Because of this, Long Beach also had plenty of chill water cooling available. The billboard arrays, and the big superstructure they were mounted on, made the ship a bit top heavy as well. Whenever Long Beach would make a turn, it would lean in the direction of the turn first and then lean a lot in the opposite direction. When this was done at dinner time we’d call it ‘having dinner rolls.’ For the longest time, the ship’s rumor mill had it that if Long Beach rolled to greater than 45 degrees to either port or starboard, the ship would capsize. In 1987 we were returning home to San Diego and because of the prevailing seas and our required course resulted in us taking seas on the port beam. One of the swells hit the ship just right and it heeled over to starboard for what seemed like a long time. The watch in Damage Control Central claimed he saw 47 degrees on the clinometer. You could hear stuff crashing in the galley and out on the mess decks. One of the juice machines came out of its mounting and crashed against a bulkhead. Afterward, the crew took to ensuring equipment was secured for sea much more seriously. USN My two sons made a couple of ‘Tiger Cruises’ on the ship and enjoyed it, although when we took a big roll they were a bit animated about it. A family friend also made one Tiger Cruise but he spent most of the time in his bunk seasick. Even a slight sea would cause Long Beach to roll but you became used to it. I remember during that same trip home we were in swells with water breaking over the 01 level forward! Up on the bridge, which was on the 010 level, the ship’s rolling motions were amplified dramatically because of the height. On the other hand, the ship didn’t pitch much (move up and down bow to stern). Additionally, Long Beach seemed to have a constant two to three-degree port list. USN Running on The Atom The major benefit to a nuclear-powered surface combatant, as opposed to a conventionally powered one, is the ability to stay on station for long periods without refueling. For nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the lack of stack gases and their corrosive effect on aircraft is another major benefit. There are several penalties of nuclear-powered surface combatants. First, there’s the high cost of training and keeping the crew. It takes almost two years of training before a nuclear-trained crew member reports to their first ship. Then there are the construction and maintenance costs. Construction of nuclear-powered surface ships is only done at Newport News Shipyard and the maintenance is only done at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and the Portsmouth Naval shipyard, in addition to Newport News Shipbuilding. There’s also the dealing with the nuclear material generated. The modern surface combatants like the Aegis cruisers and the Arleigh Burke class destroyers are gas turbine powered and require fewer crew members to operate. For example, USS Arkansas (CGN 41) had a crew of about 450 (comparable to a Belknap class cruiser) but the Ticonderoga class cruisers have a crew of only about 370. Long Beach at her commissioning on September 9th, 1961. The ship was an absolute modern marvel of her time. Note the massive Talos missiles pointing skyward. , USN First stop: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard The first place I sailed to after joining Long Beach was Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) in Washington. The ship would only go to PSNS for nuclear-related work combined with drydocking. The majority of the complicated work would be accomplished by the shipyard workers but the ship’s crew would have maintenance to accomplish as well. During the yard period in question, the ship’s hull was scraped and repainted and the voltage regulators on the ship’s service generators were updated. Back then, the crew remained living on the ship or were moved onto a living barge but remained in the industrial area. Later in my career, when I was a senior chief (E8) on the COMNAVSURFPAC/COMNAVAIRPAC Nuclear Propulsion Mobile Training Team, I was instrumental in getting funds put into yard maintenance to move the crew ashore out of the industrial area. Long Beach out at sea., Doug Healey Mastering 400 Hz In 1976, when we were returning to San Diego from Bremerton, our Division Training Petty Officer came around asking what schools anyone wanted to attend. I figured more schooling couldn’t hurt so my first choice was motor rewind school (you learned how to rewind motors, Long Beach had that capability) and my second choice was 400 Hz motor-generator maintenance. The 400 Hz motor-generators were used to provide starting power for helos and power for radars. 400 Hz motor-generator maintenance school was six weeks long and in San Diego, so I would also get six weeks at home with my family. As one of a couple of 400 Hz maintenance techs onboard, it helped me advance in rate also. An HH-3 Sea King on Long Beach’s flight deck., USN On cruise as part of the Enterprise Battle Group Long Beach left San Diego in September of 1976 on what was my first Western Pacific cruise (WESTPAC). We made a brief port call at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii with a salute to the USS Arizona Memorial. Upon arriving, we were told that we’d only be in port for a few hours and that only crew members with official business would be allowed off of the ship. Since E division was in charge of the movies for the ship, I went to the local Navy motion picture office to get new movies for the crew to watch. This also allowed me to make a quick phone call to my wife to let my family know we had arrived safely. This was long before the internet and email. Letters could take a couple of weeks to travel between the ship and home. Apparently, some of my shipmates went to the base enlisted club and got into a dust-up with some of the local sailors. When we left port after a few hours, the Engineering Officer (aka Cheng or Chief Engineer) had the supervisors go around and ensure the watch-standers hadn’t indulged in adult beverages. As a side note, the drinking age was 18 at that time. We left Pearl Harbor, once again saluting the Arizona Memorial, in company with Enterprise and the rest of our battle group. We headed down towards New Zealand. En-route, we crossed the international dateline at the equator enabling us ‘Pollywogs’ (newbies) to become ‘Golden Shellbacks’—a time-honored tradition. It was a different ceremony than what’s conducted today , not better or worse, just different. You must remember, Long Beach’s crew was entirely male. Afterward, we had a ‘steel beach’ cookout with burgers, hot dogs, and other cookout fare, but no alcohol. American ships were still dry. The Crossing The Line Ceremony goes way, way back. It has changed quite a bit over the years. Check out these sailors from one such ceremony back in 1953., Naval War College Museum After a few days’ steaming, we arrived at Auckland, New Zealand. We anchored in the harbor after dodging a few protest boats. The unions shut down the town for a protest because of our arrival. They were not fond of the Navy’s policy on nuclear arms on its vessels, which officially was ‘we can neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons on our ships.’ We pointed out to the Cheng that having an ‘Atomic Weapons Officer’ seemed counter that message. Anyway, once we were briefed on the protests (we were told not to challenge them), we were allowed to go ashore (in our uniforms for one day at least!). A few of my shipmates and I went to one of the nearby pubs for an adult beverage. In the pub, we met some of the locals, including some of the protesters. Almost everyone was very friendly. Some of the protesters told me it wasn’t anything against us, our ship or America, they were getting well paid to protest and they’d protest their own mom for the right amount. A lot of the other locals told us they were just enjoying the unplanned holiday. We wound up a few miles away from the town at a party. When it wound down, one of the locals asked if there were anyone who was sober and could drive a stick shift. I said yes to both and was tossed the keys to an MG 1100 to help ferry us back to town. It was interesting driving from the right-hand side of the car and driving on the ‘wrong’ side of the road! I thought that it would be funny if I were pulled over and showed the local cop my California driver’s license but we all made it safely back without meeting with the constables. After three days’ port visit, we got underway and held and exercise with the Aussie and Kiwi navies called ‘Kangaroo Two.’ The Aussies still had their carrier, HMAS Melbourne , but even during the photo op, she wasn’t allowed too close to either the Enterprise or us because of her collision with the USS Frank E. Evans during the Vietnam War. HMAS Melbourne is absolutely dwarfed by the Big E. , Australian Government/public domain Our next port visit after the conclusion of the exercise was Melbourne, Australia.  Once again, we were anchored out mainly due to being nuclear powered. The HMAS Melbourne was pier side in the port. Both ships were open for visitors. There was a line of well over a block to visit Long Beach and one could walk right up and go on the Melbourne . I met some locals from the RAAF (the Royal Australian Air Force) and asked them to take me to their favorite local restaurant and we ended up at a KFC! I explained I wanted to try Aussie cuisine and then they took me to an out of the way diner and the food was great but not much different from home. The majority of the cruise was without drama other than the Tu-95 Bear flybys with fighters from Enterprise escorting them off their wingtips. During this deployment, we also visited Subic Bay in the Philippines for a maintenance period, as well as Singapore (one of my favorite cities) and Pearl Harbor on the way home to San Diego. Enterprise and Long Beach together., USN Enterprise And Long Beach , closely related cousins born during the dawn of the nuclear Navy Enterprise and Long Beach were linked for most of their careers. Enterprise was the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and Long Beach was the first nuclear-powered surface warship. Long Beach was commissioned first, in September 1961, and Enterprise in November of the same year. They were both unique designs, each a kind of ‘one-off’ which generally doesn’t do well for ship designs. Enterprise had eight reactors while Long Beach had two. Long Beach was originally considered for the installation of sea-launched ICBMs, but the boomers (SSBNs) worked out and have owned the sea-based nuclear ballistic missile deterrent mission ever since. Long Beach was also planned to have the Regulus cruise missile but that program was dropped also. An early 1961 published rendering of Long Beach equipped with eight Polaris ballistic missiles. , Navy Rendering/Public Domain In the end, Long Beach seemed to be designed around the reactor plants, the SPS-32/33 (SCANFAR) radar and the Terrier and Talos missiles. The reactor plants were similar between Enterprise and ‘The Beach’ but there were enough differences that they were considered separate designs. Once the nuclear cruiser USS B a inbridge (CGN-25) was commissioned in 1962, the three ships were almost inseparable. At some point, Bainbridge required some maintenance and during my first tour on Long Beach , Truxtun had replaced Bainbridge as the third ship of the ‘nuclear trio.’ Having a nuclear-powered carrier battlegroup offered the fleet commander options that didn’t require constant refueling to remain on station. It was interesting that when on Long Beach’s bridge, you actually looked down on a carrier’s flight deck!  I’m sure that the air group’s pilots weren’t thrilled when Long Beach was on plane guard station (trailing the carrier in case of a mishap). We had an impromptu exercise with a Soviet Kynda class cruiser when they took up plane guard during my first deployment. After flight ops, the battle group went up to 30 knots and after a couple of days, the Soviets had a replenishment ship come out and refuel the Kynda . While they refueled, Truxtun would take up the safety position returning the favor they had provided during Enterprise’s flight ops. Once refueling was complete, we went back up to 30 knots! After a few days of this, the Soviets left our group. I guess they were tired of refueling. Bainbridge , Long Beach , and Enterprise, the first all nuclear-powered task force, sailed around the world in the summer of 1964. The group traveled over 30,000 miles in 65 days without the need for underway replenishment., USN A refresh then back out on another cruise After almost every deployment, ships go through what is called an ‘inter-deployment maintenance period’ due to the complexity of the systems on the ships and the normal wear and tear of use. It’s often a time when system updates and advancements are applied, as well. After a certain number of deployment cycles, the ship would go to a maintenance facility for extensive upkeep and or repair. For a nuclear-powered warship based in San Diego, this usually meant a trip to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. Our 1978 WESTPAC cruise wasn’t greatly different from the one in 1976-1977.  The major difference was the port visits. We didn’t go to New Zealand and our port visit in Australia was the city of Perth in the western part of the country. It was during this cruise that my orders to Class “C” School at NTC Great Lakes in Illinois came. I was scheduled to transfer from Long Beach in late October but because of a cyclone in the vicinity of the Philippines, I left the ship from Subic Bay as it was making preparations to get underway for storm evasion. I was sitting in my shop when I received a call from the ship’s personnel officer and was told I had 10 minutes to pack my gear and get off the ship. After packing my seabag, I collected my records (medical, dental and pay) along with my transfer orders. I was told the base would provide my travel pay. I was unaware that President Carter and Congress had a disagreement over the budget and there was no way I could be paid or get any travel pay. The travel office at Subic had a flight booked for me out of Clark Air Base and transportation to the air base. I had fewer than forty dollars since most of my pay went home to support my wife and son. I flew across the Pacific on a charter (Flying Tigers) to Travis Air Base near Sacramento, California. Fortunately for me, my wife had a sister who lived near the base and was able to pick me up. My wife arranged a flight from Sacramento to San Diego so we could drive to the base located near Chicago. An interesting note is that when Long Beach pulled out, she left about 375 sailors behind who didn’t get back to the ship before it left to avoid the storm. One of my friends who was supposed to transfer around the same time as me, but was unable to get off the ship. He was a Talos missile Gunner’s Mate and they had a problem with the missile handling system so he was unable to leave the ship before they sailed from Subic. Looking after from USS Long Beach as she rests pier-side in Subic Bay. , USN Welcome aboard USS Arkansas ! Arkansas was a brand new and very good ship. It was the last nuclear-powered surface combatant the Navy built. It was also more compact than Long Beach and had fewer crew members, but it had better accommodations. Equipment wise, it had two twin arm mark 26 missile launchers fed by a rotary magazine but carried fewer Standard Missiles (the new name for the updated Terrier missiles) and it had the unmanned five-inch gun mounts like the Spruance class destroyers had. Those of us who had been on Long Beach called Arkansas a ‘cruiser with a forged birth certificate’ since most of the official plans and manuals referred to the ship as a DLGN (nuclear powered guided missile destroyer), not a CGN (nuclear powered guided missile cruiser). However, her displacement of 11,000 tons equaled that of WWII cruisers. Being a member of the initial crew of any ship is a great experience as you will get to know the ship better than any future crew members can. I was there before the reactors were placed in the ship. A lot of the structural bulkheads were not complete and it was relatively easy to go from one end of the unfinished hull to the other. I even got to see Admiral Rickover ! He had a habit of going out on acceptance trials for all new nuclear-powered warships. He made an announcement on the ship’s announcing system which sounded like a slam on Newport News Shipbuilding. He stated “Newport News Shipbuilding used to have ‘commitment to quality’ on a rock at the entrance to the shipyard but now that rock is in a museum.” All of the plank owners were given a certificate signed by the Arkansas governor Bill Clinton designating us as honorary Arkansas Travelers. The state of Arkansas also helped sponsor a commissioning party for the ship’s crew. It was an interesting time as we did a lot of system testing that is only performed during the acceptance of the ship by the Navy. As one of the experienced electricians assigned, I was on the space turn over crew which consisted of ensuring the spaces met the Navy’s specifications (you can read more about this tense process here ). USS Arkansas sailing through San Francisco Bay. , Doug Healey Arkansas vs Long Beach Considering Arkansas and Long Beach each had essentially the same role in a battle group, I’ve always felt Long Beach was more capable. Arkansas ‘ missile launcher and gun mount positions seemed poorly thought out to me. The missile launchers each created a large no-fire zone for the guns both forward and aft. Arkansas carried fewer missiles than Long Beach and lacked a separate ASROC launcher so some magazine space in the rotary mechanism had to be reserved for ASROC missiles. Habitability wise, Arkansas was superior to Long Beach . The crew berthing areas did not have any passageways through them and each one had fewer bunks in it than on Long Beach . Arkansas had a bit less than one-half the number of Long Beach’s crew. In a lot of aspects, the difference between the two is not unlike the difference between a 1960 family sedan and a 1979 model from the same manufacturer. They both can accomplish the same tasks without a huge difference in performance. The newer model takes less to operate but in my opinion, the older model is more stylish. A close up of Arkansas bow area. Note the somewhat peculiar, if not entirely backward missile launcher-gun arrangement. , USN Back to California, back to Long Beach In order to get back to the west coast, I took a shore duty assignment as a recruiter in the Los Angeles Navy Recruiting District. It was an interesting time to be a recruiter. Recreational drug usage was high (no pun intended) among the target group for military enlistment, 17-25 year-old males. We actually had to get permission to send a female applicant to the processing station. There were a few reasons for this such as the ‘traditional’ jobs a lot of females wanted were overfilled with females (administrative and medical positions mainly) and at the time the sea duty slots for females were few and far between. We were even told not to send a female applicant, as enlistment candidates were called, for processing unless they were willing to accept a ‘non-traditional’ position such as an engineering job. This caused a small problem for one female I had sent for processing. She had scored exceptionally high on the ASVAB (military entrance exam) and would have been eligible for almost any position if all were open to women, such as the nuclear propulsion field which was closed to women at that time. So I had prepared her to accept an engineering position such as HT (hull maintenance technician) which I’d been told was wide open for women. The Chief Classifier, who had attended recruiting school with me, called and told me my applicant was not going to enlist for the position he’d offered her. This would have got me in hot water with the Chief Recruiter and the Enlisted Programs Officer at the district headquarters. I asked what he had offered her and was told it was a special air traffic controller school which was a rare offering. I asked to speak with my applicant and we talked about the position she’d been offered. She told me that she’d been interested in the HT position but after I explained the rarity of what she’d been offered, she agreed to take the air traffic controller training along with an advanced pay grade after boot camp. After that experience, I was very reluctant to send a female applicant for processing until I was working a booth at the Long Beach Grand Prix and met a Reserve Second Class who was a female and she relayed to me that her recruiter had been the guy who was the Chief Recruiter! Navy Ad I was selected for advancement to Chief Petty Officer (E7) during this tour. My regret was that my father had died from a heart attack while I was on the Arkansas and wasn’t there to witness my ‘pinning.’ As I mentioned earlier, my dad was on active duty as a Master Chief Storekeeper (supply & logistics) on shore duty in San Diego at the time of his death. At the time the Navy had only two promotion cycles for advancement to Chief (due to a budget crunch), first and last increments. The only ones who advanced in the first increment were those with many years of Naval service and since I only had seven years of service I was in the last increment. This meant I wore the Chief’s uniform for eleven months before getting the pay of a Chief. Around this time a vacancy opened at the recruiting station in Orange, California. It was a very competitive time for many reasons, not the least being you had to put four people in the Navy each month! I asked for and was assigned as Recruiter-In-Charge of Navy Recruiting Station (NRS) Orange, California. There were two recruiters assigned, including me. We each had to put the aforementioned four people (mainly men) in the Navy each month. My partner at the recruiting station was an Engineman First Class originally from the Philippines. Since we were both engineers, we hit it off from the start. The district had one Saturday a month when they conducted enlistments otherwise it was a Monday through Friday operation, however, if you had not made ‘goal’ (put your four in the war we used to say), you were expected to work on Saturdays. My partner and I aimed for goal by the 10th of each month so we wouldn’t have to work Saturdays unless our applicants couldn’t go for a physical and enlistment Mondays through Fridays. This didn’t necessarily please the zone supervisor, but he couldn’t say much as we were exceeding our goal each month. During this time, it was decided the Navy needed more recruits from the Hispanic community. The area around my recruiting station did not have a significant number of Hispanic residents, however, the school district was very good and we were able to get a good number of applicants for the Navy’s Nuclear Propulsion program so our lack of Hispanic recruits was usually overlooked. After about a year as Recruiter-In-Charge, I heard from my detailer that he needed nuclear-trained chiefs back at sea. I asked what billets were available and was told they were on California , Texas , Arkansas and Long Beach . He told me to put a request through the district CO and if approved he’d give me a spot on the Long Beach . I submitted my request and it was approved all of the way up the chain. I believe, each one of my supervisors who gave their approval thought that someone above them would disapprove my request. They didn’t realize that although recruiting is important, naval reactors were even more influential and filling Chief billets at sea was a high priority! Chief Healey, Doug Healey Still having fond memories of the Long Beach , it was an easy choice for me to return to sea duty on her and this time as a Chief. It also helped that Long Beach was homeported in San Diego while the others were based in Alameda, California. I knew Long Beach’s capabilities and I also knew the Chief’s accommodations were a bit better on Lang Beach compared with the other ships, even though Arkansas was much newer. I was also aware that Long Beach had well over 60 Chiefs, Senior Chiefs and Master Chiefs in the mess and with my father gone, I needed someone I could learn about being a Chief from. Since there were more in the mess, I felt I had a greater likelihood of finding good and less good examples to model from. We hadn’t yet learned to formalize the mentoring process in the Navy. I was correct in that there were more good examples to learn from on the Long Beach . Additionally, Long Beach still had a Marine Detachment and I was able to learn from the Marine First Sergeant and the Gunny. I believe this learning process helped me greatly in my career. A quick example was the Command Master Chief when I reported back to Long Beach was a nuclear-trained Machinist Mate. I was able to learn a lot about being a Command Master Chief from him. One quick story was when the ship was in a port for a visit, he had a group of the chiefs go out with him to check out the area. We went into one dive bar and didn’t stay long. On the way out, he pulled out a list of places that were ‘off limits’ from his pocket and crossed off the place we’d just left and announced: “now we know why that place is on the list!” Aerial view of US Navy ships docked at Naval Station North Island. They are (clockwise from bottom): the battleship USS NEW JERSEY (BB-62), the aircraft carriers USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) and USS RANGER (CV-61), the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser USS LONG BEACH ( CGN- 9 ) and the guided missile destroyer USS CHANDLER (DDG-996). , USN USS Long Beach 2.0 The Long Beach I returned to wasn’t greatly different from the ship I’d left before. The ‘billboard’ arrays of the AN/SPS-32/33 SCANFAR radar were gone and a new structure was erected over the aft superstructure to support the new AN/SPS-49 radar. A big AN/SPS-48 radar dish was also mounted on the forward mast. Gone too was the Talos missile launcher and all of the equipment that supported it. Long Beach had the cradles for the Harpoon anti-ship missiles on the fantail now. Otherwise, the remainder of the weapon systems were unchanged outwardly. I believe this altered the way the ship rode in the water as it looked like the bow was a bit lower than the stern now and it also seemed like we had a slight port list now. CGN-9 post refit., USN Setting sail alongside the USS Kitty Hawk as the Cold War heated up The 1984 deployment was different than my previous deployments on Long Beach from the start. On our way to Hawaii, at the start of the cruise, we burned up a bearing on the starboard shaft. The breakdown was caused by a watchstander’s failure to check the shaft alley hourly as required. This, I believe was caused at least in part by a shortage of Machinist Mates who would have normally been responsible for keeping track of the shaft bearings. As a result, a different division was assigned this responsibility, one they weren’t too thrilled about having. The bearing lost all of the oil from its sump and got so hot it damaged the shaft. I believe it was reported by the berthing where the Operations Specialists (formerly called Radarmen) slept. They allegedly could hear the bearing screeching. Regardless, the damage required Long Beach to stay in Pearl Harbor longer than planned and also necessitated going into drydock to replace the starboard shaft. Since we would be in Hawaii for a few extra days, my first wife and our sons came over and stayed with some friends of ours who were stationed there. While there, we noticed the Navy Exchange had t-shirts for sale calling USS Reeves (CG-24) ‘the only “real” cruiser in town.’ Needless to say, with Long Beach in port, no one was seen wearing those shirts! USN When we left Hawaii we sailed through the ‘Bear Box’ with EMCON (electronic emissions control) set to see if the Russian Bear reconnaissance planes could find us. They had no idea where we were and as we gradually turned on different radars, they finally came flying right down to where we were. We later rejoined the Kitty Hawk and made a port visit in Yokosuka, Japan. A group of took the opportunity to visit Tokyo Disneyland. As we were entering the harbor where Yokosuka is located, the Cheng (Chief Engineer) gave the ship a history lesson on how we avoided severely damaging the Yokosuka Naval Base so the US Navy could use the facilities after the Second World War, especially the dry dock facilities where the Yamato was berthed during the war. After a few days in port, we returned to sea with the entire Kitty Hawk Battlegroup. We went up into the northern Sea of Japan and while steaming in formation, a Russian Victor III submarine breached right in the middle of our formation. This wasn’t a surprise to those of us in the Engineering Department as we knew how noisy the ship was but we also had a Spruance class destroyer and a Perry class frigate in the group, both of which focus on anti-submarine warfare duties. A friend and I were sitting on one of the bits on the port side when he pointed out a periscope about 30 yards of the port beam. The Senior Chief Sonarman dismissed the sighting but when the submarine breached, the Sonarman ran down to the Combat Information Center! My friend knew a periscope when he saw one because he’d been on the USS Seadragon previously but was transferred off because of kidney stones which disqualified him from further sub duty. According to my friend, it can be very challenging maintaining periscope depth and if the sub is not trimmed correctly, it can easily breach (pop up to the surface). Since he’d been a qualified diving officer on his sub, I believed him. USN Later that evening, the battlegroup had an exercise planned to try to fool any sub monitoring the group. Kitty Hawk went alongside the USS Wabash for an underway replenishment (UNREP). When she concluded she was scheduled to modify her acoustic signature and move away and Long Beach would modify her sound signature and lighting to try to sound and look like a carrier and move into place alongside Wabash . Just as Kitty Hawk started to move away from Wabash , they passed a canex (cancel the exercise) call over ship-to-ship communications followed by “I think we (the Kitty Hawk ) hit something.” Soon after we noticed the Victor III on the surface, dead in the water.  We, Long Beach , offered assistance but were refused. The Battlegroup Commander left one of the frigates assigned behind to standby to provide assistance if needed but a Russian fleet tug eventually came out and towed the stricken Victor III away. Victor III fast attack submarine., USN We knew it was a Victor III because of the unique device on the stern vertical fin for the sub’s towed array sonar system. When we arrived in Subic Bay a few days later, they already had t-shirts proclaiming Kitty Hawk ‘the best ASW (antisubmarine warfare) platform in the Navy’ and others stating ‘ Kitty Hawk – 1, Victor III – 0!’ We were told by some of the repair personnel in Subic that a part of a blade from the sub’s screw was found embedded in the Kitty Hawk’s bottom. It was believed the Victor III was rolled through 360 degrees by the Hawk right after it struck her! The rest of the cruise was fairly uneventful and we were able to return home.

Luke J. O’Brien,"Updated on Sep 2, 2020",An Essential Guide To The Truths And Myths Of Chemical Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you were to ask the average person on the street to tell you about chemical weapons, odds are you’ll hear far more in the way of legend, born out of popular culture, than you will anything resembling fact. For most people, the only information they have on chemical weapons comes from movies like The Rock, episodes of 24 , or trashy spy thrillers. Worse still, because that level of background knowledge is so low, even those people who can speak with even a basic level of understanding can often be taken as credible, even as they rattle off incredibly misleading information. I should know this. Before I started really working in the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) field, I wasn’t much better. When I first joined the U.S. Army as an artillery officer, my sum total of chemical defense training was a short period of instruction as a cadet at Fort Lewis. That very limited instruction reinforced the fact that chemical protective suits are awful to wear more than conveying any real functional knowledge about chemical agents and their effects. Since moving into the WMD field, I’ve had the fortune to receive a great deal of education on chemical weapons at Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Aberdeen Proving Ground’s Edgewood Area, and a multitude of training courses across the country. I also had the honor of being selected as a National Defense University Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Graduate Fellow, where I was able to spend two years studying the ins and outs of WMDs at a technical and policy level. Because of this, I’ve been able to work with some of the most brilliant men and women across academia, government, and the military. DoD What I hope to debunk here are some of the persistent myths that arise whenever chemical weapons are mentioned in our national discourse. I also must note that I am currently an Army Reservist. As such, it is important to make clear that my views are my own and do not reflect those of the United States Army, the Department of Defense, or the United States Government. Chemical Weapons Basics If we’re going to myth-bust about chemical weapons, it might prove helpful to understand some the nuts and bolts that make up the topic. So, to start, understand that chemical agents can be categorized in two ways. The first is by their persistence and the second is by their mechanism of action. Persistence, as the name implies, is a measure as to how long they’ll remain in the environment. Typically agents are categorized as “persistent” and “nonpersistent,” but it’s important to realize that there’s not a hard line that separates the two categories. It’s more of a spectrum. The longer an agent remains in the environment, the more persistent it is. The quicker an agent disperses, the less persistent it is. Chemical weapons can also be categorized by their effects on the human body. There are four major types: pulmonary agents, blood agents, vesicants, and nerve agents. 1.) Pulmonary Agents: These were the first chemical weapons to be used on the battlefield. Sometimes also called “choking agents,” these weapons either kill or incapacitate by destroying the lining of the lungs and thus causing them to fill with fluid, preventing the lungs from being able to absorb oxygen. Pulmonary agents include chlorine, phosgene, and chloropicrin. Pulmonary agents are almost all non-persistent, clearing very quickly after release. 2.) Blood Agents: These agents kill by preventing the blood from being able to absorb oxygen. Think back to basic anatomy. Blood is circulated through the lungs, where it releases carbon dioxide for the body to exhale and collects oxygen to then distribute around the body. While choking agents prevent that oxygen from reaching the blood by destroying the lung lining, blood agents, in turn, affect the red blood cells, preventing them from being able to absorb oxygen. The most common (and well known) agent is hydrogen cyanide. Blood agents are also extremely non-persistent. When this lack of persistence is combined with the relatively high concentrations needed to create casualties, it’s easy to see why blood agents never saw really wide use on the battlefield. A pyrotechnician of the Society for The Disposal of Chemical Agents and Military Waste (GEKA) prepares a munition for an X-ray examination at a facility in Germany in 2013., AP 3.) Vesicants: These are otherwise known as “blister agents,” and cause severe chemical burns on any exposed skin. The most common vesicant is Sulfur Mustard, otherwise known in popular culture as “Mustard Gas” (which is a misnomer—Sulfur Mustard is actually a liquid), but other vesicants such as Lewisite also exist. It’s worth noting that while vesicants can kill you, the percentage of victims who will die is considerably small, around three percent. Death is typically caused by secondary infections caused by the chemical burns. Further, symptoms of Mustard exposure might not appear for several hours, so victims may have moved past their exposure location , as a group of BBC reporters discovered in during the Iran-Iraq war. Depending on their level of contamination, they might actually contaminate others. This can result in victims with contaminated clothing further contaminating other people and locations. As an example of this, Iranian chemical casualties were reported at the time as contaminating the medical staff at rear-area hospitals. Unlike pulmonary and blood agents, however, vesicants are persistent, with mustard sometimes taking days to weeks to clear. Consequently, vesicants have been used historically almost like minefields; if you contaminate major routes used for resupply, crossroads, or key equipment, then you can impact their operation. This means reinforcements heading to the front might become casualties as they move along contaminated roads. If you contaminate artillery positions, the crew needs to either take time to decontaminate or will have to work in protective chemical gear, which makes them move slower. This is something the Iraqis did during the Iran-Iraq War, mirroring an Imperial German tactic during the 1918 Michael Offensive during World War I. 4.) Nerve agents: These are the most deadly chemical weapons currently in existence. They degrade the body’s ability to control its own muscles. To put the process somewhat simplistically, imagine you want to ball your hand into a fist. Your body will use a chemical called Acetylcholine, which is used to tell the muscles to contract. If you want to then relax your hand, the body releases an enzyme known as acetylcholinesterase, which binds to the Acetylcholine and inactivates it, which then allows your muscle to relax. Nerve agents target acetylcholinesterase, binding to it and rendering it unusable. As such, if you were exposed to a sufficient amount of nerve agent, you would find it difficult to relax your fist. But, more critically, your body’s ability to pump air in and out of your lungs is impacted, as is the beating of your heart. This is also why one of the telltale signs of nerve agent exposure is pinpoint pupils regardless of the amount of ambient light; the muscles that control the iris of the eye have been commanded to fully constrict. There are two broad classes of nerve agent: G-Series and V-Series. The G-Series (“G” stands for “German,” since it was Nazi scientists who invented this class of chemicals) include Tabun, Sarin, Soman, and Cyclosarin. The V-Series (“V” stands for “Venomous”) include most prominently VX. G-Series agents tend to be nonpersistent (though that persistence varies, more on that later), and V-Series agents tend to be very persistent. As such, G-Series tends to be used more against military objectives that will have to be captured relatively quickly after an attack (imagine attacking a defended hillside, a trench line, bunker complex), whereas V-Series get used against more operational targets (such as airfields, ports, supply routes, major supply depots). A chemical warfare training exercise in Iran seen through a gas mask., AP Again, like sulfur mustard, none of these agents are a “gas,” but are instead liquids. That said, if you want to annoy your local chemical officer, refer to “nerve gas” in his or her presence. At a minimum, you’ll get them to twitch. So, these are the broad details you need to know to be able to understand what we’re going to talk about next. Here are a few myths that keep getting repeated, often by people who ought to know better. Definitions Matter: Not Every Unpleasant Weapon is a Chemical One Watching the news, you’ll hear plenty of people assert that chemical weapons have been used, be it the use of tear gas in any number of domestic protests in the United States to the use of battlefield obscurants , shells that generate clouds of smoke which prevent the enemy from being able to see, either with the naked eye or with thermal sights. But are these actually chemical weapons? The short answer? No. The long answer? Nooooo! Here’s why. Tear gas is classified as a “riot control agent” under the Chemical Weapons Convention . A riot control agent is defined as “Any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure.” States are prohibited to use these on the battlefield, but are permitted for domestic policing purposes. Unpleasant or no, crowd control is a legitimate government responsibility. But it seems strange that an agent that’s permitted for domestic policing would be prohibited on the battlefield Why is this? Turkish police fire off tear gas during demonstrations in Istanbul back in 2013. , AP Simple. During World War I, riot control agents were used in “mask-breaker attacks ” which were intended to improve the effectiveness of chemical weapons. Combatants would mix in riot control agents with lethal chemical agents, the intent being that victims would get a lung-full of a riot control agent, then be forced to remove their masks to cough or vomit. In doing so, the victim would then be exposed to a lethal chemical agent, which they would then inhale. It is possible Saddam Hussein did the same during the Iran-Iraq War. He used riot control agents against the Iranians, but it is not clear if he mixed in lethal chemical agents. White phosphorus, on the other hand, is not intended to have either a lethal or riot-control effect at all. It is intended primarily to screen friendly troops from enemy observation and is intended to have a secondary incendiary effect (which is actually not prohibited under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons ). Though the idea of being killed in an incendiary attack is unpleasant, it is distinct from that of a chemical attack. More on this when we get to myth #4. The ‘Kitchen Sarin’ Myth The most common description of nerve agents is that they are colorless, odorless, and invisible when in the atmosphere. This is true for Sarin, though other agents in the same family as Sarin will have a tell-tale odor (Tabun smells a little like fruit, and Soman smells like mothballs). But this is only when the chemical agents are both pure and on their own. Sarin itself might not be produced as a pure agent. Pure nerve agent could theoretically be stored for decades, but the more impurities the shorter the shelf-life. Iraqi, for example, during the Iran-Iraq War produced nerve agents as cheaply as possible, but with a high level of impurity, which meant that nerve agent used at the front had to be rushed from the production facility to the firing line. These impurities were noticeable. When delivered on the battlefield, they would appear as either a dirty-white cloud or with a yellowish-brown hue. Those impurities didn’t impact the effectiveness of the agent; they allowed the Iraqi Republican Guard to win key battles throughout the Iran-Iraq War, including the recapture of the strategically-vital Majnoon Islands in the al Faw Peninsula. Another example, albeit from a non-state actor, was the first Sarin attack carried out by the Japanese religious cult Aum Shinrkyo . Prior to their attack on the Tokyo subway system, Aum also attacked the small town of Matsumoto north of Tokyo, in revenge for local leaders suing the cult over a fraudulent land deal. The resulting cloud, due to impurities in the Sarin, resulted in a plume that looked not unlike fog , similar to the Iraqi agent used on the Majnoon Islands. In addition, Aum’s production was of a scale not unlike that of a state actor, with a large and complex manufacturing plant established for producing Sarin. This was perhaps a byproduct of just how unique Aum was, given the large number of specialty engineers that called the cult home. Photo taken in September 1998 shows the Satyam 7 facility at the AUM Shinrikyo cult’s complex in Kamikuishiki, west of Tokyo. The cult mass produced Sarin nerve gas at the facility. , AP In short, this argument seems to be built on the assumption that if a state is producing a chemical agent, it must be doing so in that agent’s pure form, and conversely, an impure CW agent must point to a non-state actor. As the Iraqi experience shows, states that are at war and under pressure will often skip the expense of producing pure agent and will manufacture with an “as needed” approach. Depending on the agent, some states aren’t even so picky as to turn their nose up at dumpster diving: the Egyptian chemical weapons program in the 1960s acquired its initial batch of sulfur mustard by cracking open artillery shells abandoned by the British military in Egypt at the end of World War I. Even the United States fell prey to this. When rushing to produce its M55 Sarin rockets during the late 1950s to counter a perceived Soviet advantage in chemical weapons, the Army recycled Sarin from other munitions, which resulted in the introduction of chemical impurities . Those impurities would eventually result in the rockets becoming leaky and unusable, eventually requiring the rockets to be dumped at sea . The environmental rules back then were far more forgiving. In short, there is a wide gap between the battlefield and the lab. Though the idea of a mad genius mixing together chemical weapons on his kitchen stove is frightening, the practical constraints are actually far more significant than most might think. And while governments have to be on the lookout for extremists who might be capable enough to produce chemical agents, there’s a reason why the majority of attacks using chemical weapons have come from state actors. Rescuers wearing gas masks take part in a countrywide Russian Emergency Situations Ministry’s drills in Petropavlovsk-Kamchtsky, Russia, October 3, 2018., AP Ironically enough, the impurities associated with chemical agents in Syria are often used as supposed evidence that the agent must have been made by the rebels and not the Syrian regime. Of course, this Analysis of the Syrian Government’s own declarations to the OPCW indicates their production method likely only resulted in an agent that was about 60% pure at best, putting it on par with 1980s Iraqi production quality. If a well-advanced state program struggled to get above 60%, what does that tell you about an extremist group’s chances? Lack of Proper Protective Equipment Points to a False Flag A common assertion made when defenders of the Assad regime want to distract attention away from a chemical attack is to argue that the Assad regime is not responsible for attacking with chemical weapons because the first responders are not wearing the kinds of protective gear that U.S. first responders would employ if faced with a similar threat. “If they’re not wearing a full chemical suit and mask, how is it they didn’t die immediately upon arrival?” Simple: persistency. Remember that nonpersistent agents evaporate quickly and are used when you need to move into an area quickly after a chemical attack. If you use a nonpersistent agent like Sarin, the agent will evaporate away into the environment in as little as a half hour. As an example, during the Iran-Iraq War the Iraqi Army used non-persistent nerve agents in this manner to capture the Majnoon Islands , killing hundreds of Iranian troops. The agent dissipated quickly enough to allow Iraqi troops to rush in and capture the objective. It was this rapid dissipation that had attracted the U.S. military to Sarin in the 1950s, with Edgewood Arsenal scientists arguing that the volatility of this particular agent would be such that it would rapidly spread into the surrounding environment (thus affecting the maximum number of targets before they had a chance to put on protective equipment) and then dissipate just as quickly. Soman , a much more dangerous nerve agent, was specifically rejected in part because it evaporated too slowly. So what does this have to do with this particular myth? If you’re moving into an area that has been attacked by nonpersistent agents like Sarin or Chlorine, you’re only going to need full protective suits if you expect exposure to drops or pools of liquid agent. This is most likely during an attack and immediately after, when the agent is being sprayed by its delivery munition. After that point, so long as you don’t touch any puddles of agent, Sarin is primarily an inhalation hazard. Even then, it takes a much larger amount of agent on the skin to cause lethal effects. Up until the 1980s, in fact, U.S. troops were trained to simply cut away any part of their clothes splashed with nerve agent, since protective clothing back then was essentially just normal uniforms that had been waterproofed. Say what you will about how unpleasant modern chemical suits are to wear, it could be a lot worse. U.S. Soldiers in their warfighting NBC suits prior to Operation Desert Storm. , DoD Another example of this is when U.S. Army Chemical Corps soldiers used to perform visual inspections of containers of Sarin stored in the open air with only a gas mask and wearing their normal uniform. Yet another example is this U.S. chemical weapons scientist placing a drop of nerve agent into a rabbit cage. Though he wears gloves and a mask, he is wearing a normal lab coat and much of the skin around his wrist and neck are exposed. Also, observe these chemical troops handling leaking Sarin bombs: though they’re wearing chemical gear to protect against the splash hazard, the backs of their heads are fully exposed. Also, remember that exposure to chemical agents isn’t a binary thing. The dose matters. Depending on your overall size, age, and health, just being exposed may not be enough to kill or even incapacitate you. If the dose is small enough, you might not even notice. If you’re arriving at the scene of an attack and the chemical agent has faded away to only a small level, you might inhale a dose and not be affected, or inhale such a small dose that you might only feel the effects later. This happened at Khan Sheikhoun, where first responders who had been at the scene of the attack arrived at the hospital and then had to seek treatment themselves. This was also a common occurrence during the Tokyo subway attack. Assuming you’re a rebel in the middle of Syria and you’re expecting a chemical attack, why wouldn’t you just buy a suit and mask from eBay just to be safe? Simple answer: sustainment. You need to remember that most modern chemical protective equipment has a shelf-life . The Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) suits the United States uses are issued in vacuum-sealed bags for a reason. These suits are designed to ensure that the individual user is somewhat comfortable while wearing them. Comfort is, of course, a relative term—there are very few service members who will react with excitement at the prospect of having to don their suits. To accomplish this, the suits are semi-permeable and have an activated charcoal liner. This is designed to allow (some) air to pass through the suit, but for chemical contaminants to be trapped by the liner. The problem is, the longer a suit is exposed to the outside air, the more environmental contaminants the liner will absorb. At a certain point, the charcoal won’t absorb any more agent, which in turn means that those agents will simply soak through and reach a soldier’s skin. Airmen don Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) protective gear at the Alpena Combat Readiness Traning Center, Alpena, Michigan during a chemical warfare training exercise. , USAF Worse, sufficient localized exposure can overwhelm the charcoal of a given area. There is a reason why you’re not supposed to kneel when wearing a JSLIST suit. If you do, and the ground is wet, the fluid will soak right through to the skin, carrying with it any contaminants that might be in the area. Charcoal might slow down permeation, but it won’t stop it. A common rejoinder might be asking me what protective steps I would take if I were going into an environment I knew to be contaminated. In a perfect world, I’d want to be in a full Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) suit. Failing that, I’d want to be in Tony Stark’s Iron Man suit. That said, however, if we’re really playing this game, then I’d say that more ideally I’d rather to be at home safe on my couch, and letting somebody else handle it. No matter what, as we sit at home and watch the Syrian Civil War unfold, we’re not faced with the same dilemma as people on the ground there. For us, we might want a full chemical suit. For them, they likely understand that one won’t be forthcoming and standing around while people slowly die isn’t an option. “Why Do We Make Such a Big Deal About Chemical Weapons When Thousands Are Killed by Conventional Weapons?” Another popular observation surrounding chemical weapons is the assertion that it’s silly to worry about chemical weapons attacks, especially in places like Syria, when conventional weapons cause so many more deaths. While this seems to make some degree of sense on the surface, once you dig a little deeper you will discover that it’s far more complicated. Chemical agents are a uniquely horrible form of warfare. The PTSD rates for combatants and noncombatants alike forced to fight and survive in a chemical environment are high , and exceed that even of high-intensity conventional warfare, and it is an effect that is passed from the survivors to their children. To deliberately deploy ignorant tropes to either protect the perpetrators or flat out deny that victims even exist is morally reprehensible. Chemical weapons are actually uniquely suited to targeting civilian populations. Even a semi-modern military can relatively effectively provide defenses to their troops against chemical weapons. You field protective masks and suits, you create vehicles with sealed interiors, and you provide decontamination assets to allow any chemically-exposed troops to clean themselves off. Yet providing the same amount of protection to an entire civilian population is extraordinarily cost prohibitive. Knowledge of how to use chemical equipment is also a perishable skill. It’s far harder to ensure that a civilian population knows how to use chemical protective equipment, even if you could afford to provide it to the bulk of the population. Consider that more Israeli civilians died from misusing their own gas masks than they did from Iraq’s Scuds themselves during Desert Storm. Chemical gear isn’t foolproof. It requires training on the part of the user. It’s far easier to factor in training for military formations than it is for a civilian populace. Israeli citizens periodically train to dawn gas masks at a moments notice. , IDF Given the scale problem with defenses, consider then a conventional weapon placed next to a chemical one. Generally speaking, you can offer similar protection to a civilian from bomb damage about as much as you can a uniformed combatant. After all, a wall or basement offers the same protection against shell fragmentation to a combatant as it does a civilian. A chemical weapon, however, potentially offers the scenario where a combatant will likely be safely protected by his or her protective mask, while a civilian likely will not. Of course, the world has been very lucky in that chemical attacks against civilian targets have been relatively restrained. We can, in part, thank the norm against chemical use for this. When chemical weapons use risks international outrage, it incentivizes the user to try to keep the scale as low as possible. This, in turn, helps reduce the death toll. When chemical weapons use becomes normalized, the potential for increased civilian casualties rises dramatically. “Why Would Assad Use Chemical Weapons? What Does He Have to Gain?” This is a topic I’ve written about previously , but it is still almost inevitable that whenever there is a report of a chemical weapon attack in Syria, people will inevitably ask “what does Assad have to gain using chemical weapons?” Often, this question is not raised honestly. That said, it preys on ignorance both about the war in Syria and chemical weapons in particular. Simply put, chemical weapons have been a useful tool to the Syrian regime. Given all we’ve talked about up to this point, this shouldn’t be too surprising a proposition. Insurgents and their host populations can’t protect themselves against chemical weapons nearly as well as they can conventional bombs. More to the point, the sheer terror factor of chemical attacks have their own utility. Counterinsurgents seek to defeat their adversaries by separating them from the population. In doing so, insurgents lose their necessary support base and are denied the natural concealment afforded by being able to blend into population centers. The Assad regime has used indiscriminate strikes on civilian population centers, from cluster munitions to barrel bombs , to affect such a population drain. Hazardous chemicals that are used to produce chemical weapons. , AP Idlib, the last remaining area outside of Syrian Regime control, actually stands testament to how well this works. The sheer number of refugees that have crowded into Idlib have in turn come from other areas subjected to similar indiscriminate population attacks. Defenders of the regime will often point to the fact that civilians fleeing from these areas were provided with buses to help with their evacuation. But the entire point of these air attacks was to make such transfers seem attractive, so as to drain the final sources of rebel support. Small chemical attacks, then, serve a key purpose despite their comparatively low body counts. Finally, this myth also shows a real ignorance of the dynamics of the Syrian conflict. For most western political audiences, there have only been a couple of chemical attacks. There was the Ghouta attack in 2013 (which resulted in the Syrian regime cynically joining the CWC while essentially continuing their chemical campaign), the Khan Sheikhoun attack in 2017, and the Douma attack in 2018. Those last two attacks resulted in retaliatory strikes by the United States and its allies. Yet there have actually been at least 50 chemical attacks across Syria since the start of the civil war. Other open source researchers have identified over 250 attacks. Chemical attacks in Syria aren’t the one-off things that conspiracy theorists like to pretend they are. Conclusion Despite the Chemical Weapons Convention, it is likely that the world will have to deal with chemical weapons for the foreseeable future. Multiple countries, such as Egypt, Israel, and North Korea, remain outside the Convention. Further, signatories like Syria continue to flaunt their obligations under the convention. In addition, given events in the news, it seems that chemical weapons remain an attractive option for state actors even at low-levels. Russian soldier geared up for a chemical warfare combat enviroment., AP Despite this, the international norm against chemical weapons matters. The stronger that norm is, the harder it is for states to get away with using chemical weapons, which means that they’ll ever eschew them completely or be forced to limit the scale of their use. There are numerous projects, such as CSIS’ Restoring Restraint , which seek to find ways to strengthen these norms further. But in order to do this, the public at large have to understand what chemical weapons are, what they aren’t, and what they can and can’t do. Education, in other words, is crucial. Hopefully, this quick explainer can play some role in that process. Luke J.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 17, 2019",Censored Craft Near Hangar Appears In Satellite Image Of Secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tonopah Test Range Airport has deep roots in clandestine air operations. From housing America’s captured Soviet fighter force during the Cold War, to being the home of the F-117 during the program’s top-secret operational years , with the type later returning there for its peculiar post-retirement era , the base has captured the imaginations of aerospace aficionados, albeit to a lesser degree than its sprawling and even more remote and guarded neighbor to the south, Area 51 . In recent years, the base is known to have hosted RQ-170 Sentinel stealth reconnaissance drones, as well as foreign air defense systems and other weaponry. It also serves as a launch site for testing upgrades made to special operations aircraft among other functions. Even successors of the Army’s ‘Stealth Hawk’ helicopters are rumored to operate from the installation and there has been much speculation that advanced unmanned systems , namely unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAVs) , currently call the base home. The reality is that if anywhere is going to support a small force of highly classified but operational aircraft, it’s Tonopah. Just as the F-117 lived in total darkness at the base for nearly a decade, most of what is flying out of there now is also very likely to use the cloak of night to ensure its own anonymity. That’s why it’s very peculiar to come upon the satellite imagery posted at the top of this article and below. The image is apparently part of a recent update to Google Earth and other mapping sites. It shows a craft sitting just outside one of the end hangars that make up the rows of 54 similar hangars arrayed across the north side of the base, also referred to as ‘canyons’ in Tonopah and F-117 vernacular. Bing Maps The image is interesting on two levels. First off, what exactly are we looking at? It’s hard to tell, but it certainly looks like an aircraft. To us it resembles a flying wing and is very similar to the RQ-170’s planform. The light color would also match. The only difference is that this aircraft appears to have a wingspan approaching 80 feet, which is significantly larger than that of the RQ-170 . So in that sense, this aircraft would be somewhere between an RQ-170 and the P175 Polecat in terms of proportions. This is the size of vehicle that we have posited to have existed for some time—a ‘Super Sentinel’ of sorts that is capable of performing strike and electronic attack missions. The openings to the southern portion of canyon hangars at Tonopah are roughly 90 feet wide, so they can accommodate a fairly large flying-wing drone. But once again, although we can guess, it’s impossible to assign an exact ID to the vehicle. As to why brings us to the second major reason why this image is significant—it has been edited. The photo, dated Oct. 1, 2017 and attributed to Digital Globe, has clearly been touched-up to conceal the details of the aircraft seen in front of the hangar. Usually, personnel at sites that work with sensitive hardware like secret aircraft are very aware of the schedules of imaging satellites that pass overhead. Test schedules and even the movement of an aircraft from one hangar to another can be dictated by the satellites’ predictable orbital paths. But no system is perfect and the need to conceal test articles or even semi-operational aircraft from overhead view is also dictated by the sensitivity of the asset. We have no idea what exactly happened here, but clearly, corrective action was taken after the satellite’s shutter had snapped open and close. Interestingly enough, another satellite image that was taken in July 2016 also shows indications of being doctored to conceal an aircraft sitting in front of the same hangar. In this case, the anomaly looks like it could be a MiG-29. The extrapolated wingspan of that blurry craft matches the Soviet era twin-engined fighter. Still, this is just a guess, as there is very little visual information to work off of. Google Earth The RQ-170 has been photographed in satellite imagery before. I actually wrote a post on just that back in 2015 . But when it comes to images of Tonopah Test Range Airport on Google Earth, photos that were in the system seemed to have dropped off. Including ones that show a UH-60 Black Hawk around a hangar that has shown a lot of activity in recent years. But never before have we seen what appears to be a unique aircraft deliberately blurred in an image. These revelations come as Motherboard has published a big story accusing Google of altering its mapping practices for national security reasons and in particular omitting updates of the range area just south of Tonopah Test Range Airport, which the contractor Sandia Corporation operates on behalf of Sandia National Laboratories. We’ve assessed Motherboard’s claims to be dubious at best and that area is not that secretive at all. It is primarily where nuclear bomb shapes are tested, but it also supports a rolling set of diverse tests for a range of ‘customers.’ Sandia has publicized the area’s purpose extensively even in their own video productions . Initially, Motherboard’s piece claimed that there had been no updated imagery of the area in question within the Tonopah Test Range between 2008 and 2017. After publication, the authors added an update to note that Google had at some point added historical images of ‘the gap’ for both 2014 and 2015. “Google Earth didn’t censor this area in Nevada. Our satellite imagery is licensed from third party providers which are commercially available and are not the property of Google,” a Google spokesperson subsequently told Motherboard , as well. “We update imagery by prioritizing areas that are most popular with users while complying with local and federal laws.” It’s true that if you plug in the map coordinates the authors provided, 37o41’6.39″N, 116o39’57.31″W, it does indeed bring you to a location and altitude where there is only imagery for 2007, 2014, 2015, and 2017. However, the Motherboard story includes a picture of a much broader area with the caption “The Tonopah Gap.” This picture appears to reflect what you’d see from an altitude of approximately 8.7 miles up in Google Earth. Again, for this particular position, there are only previous images of that location for 2007, 2014, 2015, and 2017. The central location of the “Tonopah Gap” as described in the Motherboard article., Google Earth However, if you zoom out less than a mile more, there is historical imagery of very similar resolution of the same area for every year since 2007. In addition, while the “gap” the authors of the Motherboard piece identified at the dry lake bed might have been the longest, a cursory look at other locations around the Tonopah Test Range Airport show that there is similarly absent imagery at various altitudes and date ranges between 2007 and 2016. If you explore the imagery well outside of the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range, which encompasses Tonopah, you’ll find similar ‘gaps’ in the utterly mundane and largely desolate Nevada desert. This would make sense and lends weight to the statement from Google that it updates Google Earth’s imagery library based on its understanding of user demand. It also further calls into question whether there is any particular significance to the absence of imagery, and only at certain altitudes, of the dry lake beds near Tonopah. There’s no clear indication that Google avoided that particular area specifically or deliberately. This innocuous piece of the Nevada Desert, at the coordinates 37o39’44.60″N, 117o08’12.39″W, situated 20 miles west of the “Tonopah Gap” has no imagery between 2006 and 2010, between 2010 and 2013, or between 2013 and 2016. This equals 8 years of missing imagery since 2006, the same total that is absent from Google’s library for the dry lake southeast of the Tonopah Test Range Airport.  , Google Earth Still, it is possible that there is some sort of censorship going on, as we also know that Google and/or its image providers have clearly censored specific locales in far more obvious ways, but it is more likely that they have not obtained or uploaded images of those particular areas for more benign reasons, as the company said in its statement. The team behind Google Earth was able to backfill images of the area in question without any apparent issue and it’s possible that they will add more shortly given the likely increase in interest in the area. The Motherboard piece does go into some detail about how entire images are kept from the public. This is either through ‘shutter control,’ asking companies to not photograph an area at all, or via ‘buy-and-deny,’ wherein the U.S. Government buys exclusive rights to images and then sits on them. The United States has reportedly never once ordered an imagery provider to use shutter control. Regardless, none of these mechanisms explains how individual objects get obscured or blurred in the images that do get released. That issue has been of major interest dating back to when the game-changing web tool was launched well over a decade ago. Google spokesperson Deanna Yick told Mashable the following back in 2012: “The satellite and aerial imagery in Google Earth and Google Maps is sourced from a wide range of both commercial and public sources… These third-party providers are required to follow the law of the countries in which they operate, so some of them may blur images and then supply us with those images. … We strive to publish the best data possible, and take into account many elements when determining which imagery is optimal, such as imagery date, resolution and clarity… We receive updated information from our data providers from time to time, and if those updates improve the imagery of the area based on all of those quality elements, we may elect to publish that updated imagery even if the provider has blurred certain regions of the image.” So the real story here doesn’t appear to be located on the dry lakebed to the south Tonopah Test Range Airport, but instead at the airport itself where there is real evidence that images have been manipulated to obscure sensitive objects. If anything else, the doctored images of Tonopah Test Range Airport add more evidence to the fact that the base remains highly active when it comes to supporting operations of sensitive if not top-secret aircraft.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2021",The U.S. Army Once Blew Up Tunnels In A German Town To Chase Away A Ghost,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Military bases and their surrounding communities are hardly strangers to ghost stories , often situated on or near the sites of famous battles and infamous deaths. While they’re good tales to tell on Halloween, rarely have they prompted any actual action. But one apparently did in 1970s, when U.S. Army soldiers are said to have destroyed a series of tunnels near their base in Germany to chase away a spirit – or at least try to put an end to the reported sightings. The town of Freihung, situated some 10 miles to the east of the Grafenwoehr Training Area , a major installation that the Army has occupied since 1945, is home to the legend of Die Weisse Frau , or The White Lady . The medieval noblewoman is said to have haunted the area since dying in a castle that once stood in the center of town, which is now the location of Gasthof Alte Post hotel. The exact cause of her death is unclear, but was supposedly sufficient to curse her soul to remain bound to the castle and its surroundings. The bulk of the reported sightings were in a series of underground tunnels underneath where the castle had stood, which the hotel was still using in the latter half of the 20th Century. White ladies are a staple in ghost stories around the world, with their white clothing and pale appearance often associated with purity. The legends often deal with the loss of an immediate family member, such as a spouse or child. These should not be confused with “ White Women ,” which also make common appearances in German and other European mythology and are understood to date back to Old Norse legends about elf-like spirits inhabiting certain locations. A member of the Grafenwoehr Public Affairs Office impersonates The White Lady of Freihung in 2012., US Army The White Lady of Freihung isn’t even the only one in the general area. Less than 15 miles to the south, a pair of these specters reportedly settled outside the town of Amberg after their unfortunate deaths in a separate castle. Per that tale, two wealthy sisters, one of whom was blind, lived there together. After finding out her sighted sibling had been stealing her wealth, the blind one cursed their home, at which point it supposedly sunk into the earth, killing them both. Though witnesses who claim to have seen the White Ladies of Amberg describe them as benign spirits, the ghost in Freihung is reportedly more aggressive. She wanders the streets at night and appears to drivers seated in the back seat of their cars as they drive through the area, according to the stories. She then disappears the moment they look back to check what they’ve seen in their rearview mirrors. All of this apparently became too much for the proprietors of the Gasthof Alte Post in the 1970s. Army soldiers from Grafenwoehr eventually came in to seal the tunnels under the hotel for good with high-explosives, according to an official 2012 story from the base’s public affairs office. US Army soldiers clear a room of mock enemies, not ghosts, in a shoot house at Grafenwoehr Training Area during a much more routine training exercise in 2013., US Army There’s no explanation for why the locals called in the American troops rather than German authorities or even civilian construction contractors. The demolition would have offered a training opportunity for Army engineering or other personnel, albeit a decidedly unorthodox one. Whether they were actually trying to drive out the ghost or just put an end to reports of her sighting, it didn’t work. The legend of The White Lady persisted in Freihung, according to the 2012 Army news item . It’s not clear if that’s still the case today. If she has moved on, it apparently took more than Army explosives to send her on her way.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 21, 2019",Historic Topgun Hangar At Marine Corps Air Station Miramar Is Notoriously Haunted,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to haunted military installations, ships, and even airplanes, one place pops into my mind above all others. That place is Miramar’s historic Hangar One that hosted the Navy Fighter Weapons School, better known as Topgun, for decades and was also featured in the cult classic flick by the same name. There are plenty of recollections of Hangar One being haunted floating around. I stumbled upon this lore by happenstance way back in mid-1990s when I spent time at the base, then known proudly as ‘Fightertown USA,’ as a teenager thanks to a friend of the family. This included some extended time in the F-14A simulator, which was a real highlight to this very day. When we were in VF-101’s hangars, which were situated across from the group of hangars that supported the adversary program and Topgun, some sailors were swapping a Tomcat’s engine and mentioned that they would be there till late that night. The other sailor replied something like, “rather here than in Hangar One, late nights there were creepy as hell!” I asked the high-time Tomcat instructor that was hosting me what the deal was and he said the place is notorious for being haunted. As the years have passed, that stuck with me and I have asked other Topgun personnel about the haunting. Some had personal experiences usually surrounding the labyrinth of offices that are arranged above the hangar bay. One even heard a massive crash and screams while working late in one of the bays, only to find the place peaceful and empty. The hangar definitely has seen a lot of history. Here’s how Paul Nickell, who was a student at Topgun and an instructor back in the 1980s, described the place in our exclusive series on taming the Tomcat and flying for the elite Navy Fighter Weapons School: “I think it was the second oldest hangar at Miramar, but it was designated Hangar One. It sat at the east end of Runway 24 Right, just to the north of the hold short line. Most likely built in the 1950s, it wasn’t there in the early 1940s when my dad was stationed at then Camp Kearny as a B-24 radioman. It had survived a flamed out pilotless F-8 Crusader crashing into it in December of 1969, a tragedy that took 14 lives. Across the north side of the hangar, facing the road, in huge deep-blue block letters was the word “TOPGUN.”  At the time, Topgun was not a household word. The average American had no idea what it was, but that would change soon. After parking in the lot across the street, we walked past a couple of large dumpsters on the side of the parking lot entrance, crossed the street, climbed a few steps and returned a salute from the gate guard. About 50 feet away, in the northeast corner of the hanger, was a single width blue metal door. Above the door was a white metal sign screwed to the corrugated grey metal siding which read “WELCOME TO NAVY FIGHTER WEAPONS SCHOOL” in black stenciled letters. In the center of the sign was a large sticker of the Topgun emblem. Entering the door, we were in a stairwell that went halfway up and then switched back to complete the journey to the second level. The walls of the stairwell were painted gloss white and were covered with neatly spaced red silhouettes of MiG aircraft kills from Vietnam.  Below each were the aircrew names and the date of the kill. Additionally, there were two recent silhouettes from Libya. At the top of the stairs, we turned left and started down a hallway. The right side was solid and was the exterior wall of the hangar. There was one opening on the right, about the size of a double door, with an accordion metal contraption across it so that no one would accidentally walk out the opening and fall 20 feet to the ramp below. The remainder of the wall was covered with a small group of pictures of the current Topgun staff and plaques. There were several rows of plaques that ran the length of the hallway, probably 100 yards or more. Each plaque was a gift from a crew that had attended training at Topgun, and each had a unique story behind it. There were literally hundreds of them. Down the left side of the hallway were the squadron spaces. The CO and XO offices were first with a secretary in front. There was a small ready room where the Squadron Duty Officer sat during flight ops. There were several small groups of briefing and debriefing rooms, along with two relatively large classrooms. Beyond that was the operations office and the training office. We were directed into Classroom One which was walled with 4X8 sheets of imitation wood paneling. There were tables and chairs to seat about 35 students plus a row of chairs with no tables across the back for additional guests. The left side of the classroom had a single air conditioning window unit that dumped the heat and humidity from the classroom into the hangar.  There were a few large TV’s in the corners. At the front of the classroom was a whiteboard, a podium, and an opaque plastic screen that slides could be projected onto from behind. At numerous places around the room there were models of different types of US and threat fighter aircraft attached to wooden dowels that could be used for briefing and debriefing purposes. Most of the furnishings of this room and the rest of the spaces had probably been lifted from somewhere else on the base or traded for through the Navy supply system. Obviously, none of it appeared nice enough to have had origins on an Air Force base.” So yeah, Hangar One provided a fairly rustic working environment considering the leading-edge of Navy fighter tactics development emanated from there for a quarter of a century. The famous stairwell at Topgun’s original headquarters at NAS Miramar. The school is now located at NAS Fallon in far more modern accommodations. , USN The horrific crash that Paul Nickell mentions is largely regarded as the source of supposed hauntings. The accident was horrendous, literally a worst case scenario, that took multiple lives and left the hangar with noticeable scars. The convergence of this historic tragedy and the strange happenings that persisted inside the hangar even after the Navy turned the facility over to the U.S. Marine Corps in 1997 resulted in an official story from the USMC about it. Although the story is no longer accessible on the Marine Corps’ site, it has been posted around the net. It reads in full: Haunted History spooks Hangar One Submitted by: MCAS Miramar Story Identification Number: 200419113431 Story by Cpl. Tara Dawn Smith MARINE CORPS AIR STATION MIRAMAR, Calif. (Jan. 8, 2004) History is something that lives anew whenever events and lives of the past are revisited for reflection or examination. However, it seems that in the case of Hangar One, occasionally history visits the present … in the form of ghosts. According to Joe Glasser, Martin-Baker representative at Miramar, there are those who have encountered the non-corporeal inhabitants of the hangar. Glasser explained one such ghostly event occurred one late afternoon when then Naval Air Station Miramar was transitioning into Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. An officer, from Marine Aircraft Group 11 then located at MCAS El Toro, knocked on the hatch of Glasser’s office and explained he would be surveying the offices in the hangar’s upstairs. Twenty minutes passed and again the officer was at Glasser’s hatch. This time however, the officer was out of breath and visibly lighter in color, said Glasser. When the Marine officer was able to articulate his concern, he asked if there were reports of unusual occurrences in the catwalks of the building. Glasser commented that he had heard rumors of “visitations from a netherly realm,” but hadn’t experienced first hand accounts. The officer then related his account of the events from his inspection of the upper offices in the hangar. Long hallways upstairs make it difficult for some to slip away from view quickly. So, when the MAG-11 officer heard footsteps and saw an opaque shadow through the frosted glass of the office, he expected to be greeted by someone walking the corridors. What he found appeared to be quite unsettling, said Glasser. When the officer opened the door to look for the person generating the footsteps and shadow, he saw nothing more than an empty hallway. These brushes with the supernatural begs the question, what past events of the hangar could cause it to be possessed by former and now deceased residents of the building? Jim Bradbury, the Martin-Baker representative in 1969, might know something about the haunted history of Hangar One. Bradbury explained he was visiting the base on business on Dec. 22, 1969 when he witnessed a tragic event that left 14 dead. The pilot of an F-8 crusader of Fighter Squadron 191 safely ejected over Kearny Villa Rd. after the engine of the plane seized, but the plane continued its course that passed through the hangar doors crashing into the north wall. The crash sent fuel spilling that ignited and engulfed several mechanics in the hangar. One ejection seat mechanic was working on a seat in a plane at the time of the event and was ejected into the roof of the hangar. Six F-4 phantoms stationed in the hangar were destroyed in the collision. Fissures that are still visible in the wall of the hangar serve as a scar of the crash. The hauntings and lasting damage to the hangar aren’t the only way this tragedy, and sacrifice of service members who paid the ultimate price, live on. A more concrete monument that stands as a testament to the event is a memorial located on the golf course that commemorates those killed in Hangar One on Dec. 22, 1969. A plaque with the names of all the deceased rests south of the driving range keeping the memory and history of those servicemembers alive. The aftermath of the 1969 F-8 crash., Public Domain A few years ago, I was talking with a technician who spent time in the facility back in the 1990s. He relayed some of the creepy stories he had heard of and one he experienced himself having to do with a shadow-like human figure approaching him head-on in a hallway before suddenly disappearing. I asked if he had heard any new reports of the Hangar still being haunted. He replied: “When the ghosts finally realized the base had been turned over to the fucking Marine Corps they probably got the hell out of there too!” You gotta love old sailors, even tragedy and manifesting spirits can’t keep their sense of irony and humor down.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to conveying concepts even as fascinating but as complicated as how to use layer depth to evade enemy sonar, eyes can glaze over very quickly and attention spans can evaporate. Pretty much everything that has to do with the shadowy art of submarine warfare is either very complicated or ambiguous, but like anything else, a very good teacher can make a world of difference. One man, in particular—retired submariner Aaron ‘Jive Turkey’ Amick— is such a teacher and has deservingly found a dedicated audience in YouTube’s potent gaming community. Beyond his gaming commentary, he has pulled out his whiteboard for viewers and has proven that the world of undersea combat and submarines isn’t nearly as inaccessible as it seems. Tackling subjects ranging from submarine to satellite communications to how high-tech steel leviathans of the deep deal with trash in a really down-to-earth and remarkably clear way has made his Youtube channel one of my favorites. Above all else, it provides a far more accessible explanation of the nuts and bolts of submarine warfare than pretty much anything I have seen in the past. On top of it, the primary game that Amick talks about, in addition to his explainer videos, relates right back to them and has captured my interest. The title is called Cold Waters and it looks like one impressive submarine combat simulator. Just as we have down in the past when we have seen ex-military personnel hit YouTube to share their expertise and passion by way of video game tutorials and explanations, The War Zone reached out to the Hawaiian shirt-clad Jive Turkey to find out how he ended up creating such a unique channel, what his background is, and yes, how he got that nickname! But before we dive into that, here are a bunch of his must-watch videos: https://youtube.com/watch?v=BcH22wOsUQ8 https://youtube.com/watch?v=_-3khvUtY9I https://youtube.com/watch?v=Eb6e_-HvBzw https://youtube.com/watch?v=LpktQLQqMo8 https://youtube.com/watch?v=Et5vdyF5Axs https://youtube.com/watch?v=wEUr_1ityME https://youtube.com/watch?v=93tLdaSDMI0 https://youtube.com/watch?v=0yeNJLUKnMk https://youtube.com/watch?v=V8d8CY9_6mM https://youtube.com/watch?v=_S9wRl9zpw0 Jive Turkey doesn’t just talk about tactics and combat systems—in addition to his eclectic gaming focused fair—he also gives fantastic explanations of how submarines function, how their command structures are organized, and more, many of which are prompted by reader mail. https://youtube.com/watch?v=C4NoXPvYkyk https://youtube.com/watch?v=Fx_Nst3eOGo https://youtube.com/watch?v=-hOgs9NsrJA https://youtube.com/watch?v=C_hkcg5O7Ck https://youtube.com/watch?v=En5I_hbRaFA https://youtube.com/watch?v=_JhiwV0s7yY https://youtube.com/watch?v=QsLYRmng1BU https://youtube.com/watch?v=uRgTCrPsHr4 https://youtube.com/watch?v=2hG-KTFjkeQ So who is the man behind the Jive Turkey moniker and these awesome videos? We found out in what turned out to be a particularly awesome Q&A: Clearly, you have a Navy background, can you give us an idea of what this background is? I joined the U.S. Navy in 1990. I spent a year going to submarine and sonar schools. During that time, the Navy was adding a lot of technical schools to the training pipeline and top students were moved into the next school instead of given orders to a sea command. This allowed me to move up from A school (basic sonar) to C school (advanced sonar) to multiple Maintenance Specialist schools just by keeping my grades up. By the time I got to my first submarine, I had attended most sonar schools the Navy had to offer. My first submarine was a 688 Los Angeles class fast attack boat out of New London Submarine Base in Connecticut, the USS Philadelphia . I remember checking onboard that morning, the crew was very busy. Everyone was bustling around, loading supplies and food. We were going underway for a deployment in just a few days. The senior enlisted man, the Chief of the Boat, sat me down outside sonar during my check-in process and told me I was very lucky. We are going on the most important mission in his 20+ year career. He was right. I spent the next 4 months underwater collecting intelligence that was used for the Daily White House Briefing in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union. I was hooked on spying. I loved it. I extended that sea tour as long as possible and conducted many intelligence gathering and training missions in the North Atlantic. The Navy never acknowledged our exact mission locations for good reason. After about five years of that, it was time to rotate to another command. There was a new sonar system that was being installed on subs and I took advantage of my rotation date to get back into the training pipeline. I spent half of 1996 in classroom learning the AN/BQQ-5E sonar system operation and maintenance. The last half of that year was spent learning submarine warfare tactics and current intelligence on every major sea power in the world. This was the most difficult and intense learning I have ever experienced. It’s a lot of memorization of hundreds of frequencies across dozens of platforms and weapons from over 30 countries. At night, we would take that knowledge and employ it in the Tactical Trainer—the most realistic submarine simulator ever built. With five years at sea experience and one year of intense training, I went back to sea on the Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarine USS Maine out of Kings Bay Naval Base in Georgia. I did a full tour of hiding 24 D-5 Trident nuclear missiles in the Atlantic. There were a few occasions when Russia would send their Akulas down to look for us, but it’s a big ocean. We just avoided them. USS Maine , USN After back-to-back sea duty tours, I thought I’d give shore duty a shot. I become an Instructor at King’s Bay Naval Base Trident Training Facility. I became a Master Training Specialist and taught in the tactical pipeline. I really enjoyed helping young sonarman become strong tactical advisors. Some of my students went to commands like the USS Jimmy Carter , which focus on Special Operations. In 2003, we invaded Iraq again. This increased the demand on our base security that was supported by both the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps. I volunteered to train with the Marines and assist in base security for a year. This was the most physically challenging time in my military career. By this time, I was over 30 years old and running obstacle courses and live fire exercises with Marines. It was great! Eventually, the Navy wanted me back at sea, so I took another fast attack boat out of New London. On the USS Pittsburgh , I conducted missions in the North Atlantic and South Pacific. The fast-paced lifestyle of a submarine sailor hunting in the world’s oceans came to a halt when my sub went into an extended drydock period. It was getting to the end of my career at this point and I didn’t want to spend it in a drydock. I requested a transfer. The Navy recognized my ability to teach and put me on a Training Tiger Team for the latest sonar system, the AN/BQQ-10. I rounded out 20 years of submarine service by going to multiple sea commands training their Weapons Department on employment of the new sonar tools in the BQQ-10 suite. How did you go from the shadowy world of undersea intelligence gathering and submarine warfare to creating awesome YouTube videos about it? After the Navy, I finished my degree in Computer Network Engineering and got a job contracting for IBM in central Florida. In the evening, I would record PC video games like Civilization V and post them to YouTube as a hobby. I had a very small audience of about 100 subscribers who regularly checked in to see what kind of shenanigans I was doing to alter ‘world history.’ In January of 2017, I resigned my day job and decided to focus on my YouTube channel full time. I began making videos regularly. But, my channel did not grow for five months and I was faced with the realization that maybe YouTube and online entertainment was not going to be my next career. Cold Waters was released in June of 2017 and I bought a copy. It’s a Cold War era submarine game centered around the American 688 fast attack submarine. I decided to record some Cold Waters gameplay while narrating real-world employment tactics. My first Cold Waters video ‘Greenland Sea Convoy Hunt’ got over 200K views. https://youtube.com/watch?v=FZ5qDn0KM8E Then, fellow YouTuber and Navy man ‘The Mighty Jingles’ found my channel while looking for Cold Waters tutorials and told his 700K subscribers to check out my channel. I went from 100 subscribers to over 20K in about three weeks in June of 2017. That’s when my YouTube career began. Tell us a bit about Cold Waters. Is the game fairly realistic? What makes it special? Cold Waters is a real-time naval combat submarine simulator. It has realistic physics, ship models, weapons capabilities and dynamic underwater acoustic environments. While contacts are automatically gained and faded, the player is required to classify them manually and maneuver their submarine for target motion analysis. Cold Waters uses player’s maneuvers to realistically improve a contact solution. The player then makes tactical decisions based on what limited information they have gleaned. It’s the most realistic nuclear submarine simulator since the Jane’s Dangerous Waters PC game. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IBxaxWQ8wdc https://youtube.com/watch?v=44N5Z2e_M4Y https://youtube.com/watch?v=y-OQM1xMcNo https://youtube.com/watch?v=yRTc5YgjgzM https://youtube.com/watch?v=CjRql5Zb_g8 https://youtube.com/watch?v=7rqaYlLPhOU You do such a fantastic job explaining very complex technical concepts in an accessible way. Where do you think that talent came from? Complex systems are difficult for me to memorize, so I break it down into general blocks. That simplification helps me remember how things work. It has an additional benefit of also ‘declassifying’ a lot of the topics I discuss. The exact process of how we do just about anything on a nuclear submarine is classified at various levels. Some mundane tasks still have a ‘confidential’ restriction. But, by using my generalized, block step method to convey these tasks, I not only ‘declassify’ them, but it also makes them easy to understand. What are five things people misunderstand or don’t even know about submarine warfare? 1.) It’s boring. We search 24/7 diligently for weeks and months often without anything to show except our own wellbeing. 2.) Submariners do a lot of different jobs. I was a Sonarman by rate, but I was also responsible for a firefighting hose team, a dewatering team, weapons handling, equipment maintenance, sonar division personal requests, and providing division and weapons department training. It’s the most I have ever worked in my life. 3.) Submarine warfare is happening right now. There is a continuous effort by other nations to gain a tactical at sea advantage over our weapon platforms. The U.S. Navy works hard every day to prevent that. 4.) It’s slow. When a target comes within detection range, it often just fades in slowly from background noise over several minutes. The operators must be patient and always vigilant. A quiet watch can become the most important watch of your mission in an instant. 5.) It will change your perspective on the world.  The most intense time in my life was hunting another human in a submarine. Man is the ultimate target because he’s clever and expects you. I have no interest in wildlife hunting now because I’ve hunted at a level that doesn’t begin to compare. How did you get the nickname Jive Turkey? I went to Public School here in the backwater swamp of central Florida in the 1970s. I was one of the only white boys on the school bus and the driver would yell, “sit your Jive Turkey ass down!” when he had been drinking. So, the other kids called me Jive Turkey and the name stuck.

Douglas Healey and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 25, 2019",Recollections Of Life At Sea And Some Advice From A U.S. Navy Force Master Chief,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the second part of our two-part series with Master Chief Douglas Healey, we jump into the back half of his career, during which we see Healey spend more time on a refitted USS Long Beach before taking assignments on two additional ships, as well as his rise to the position of U.S. Pacific Fleet Force Master Chief. We also get some rare straight talk on what the Navy needs most and on what it takes to be an effective leader, as well as so much more, from the veteran sailor. So without further adieu, in the Master Chief’s own words, let’s begin: Top Gun hits the theaters Long Beach’s 1986 surge cruise with Ranger was to fill a gap in the deployment cycles caused by another carrier’s problems. Our group commander, CruDesGru 1 (Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1), ‘volunteered’ Long Beach for it because we were thought of as the readiest cruiser on the West Coast despite a number of Aegis ( Ticonderoga class) cruisers in the Pacific Fleet. We had just won the award for the best anti-air warfare cruiser in the Pacific Fleet. We were deployed to the northern Pacific Ocean and gone from home for 59 days because if we’d been gone for 60 days or longer it would have counted as a deployment. I believe Top Gun came out around this time because I recall going to see it when we stopped in Anchorage on our way home to San Diego. The only difference I noted was that everyone thought they could become a Navy pilot afterward. Most of the movie watchers didn’t realize it was most likely a combat air controller on a ship like Long Beach that vectored Maverick to the MiGs! Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, especially the flying scenes. I think most F-14 jocks were a bit of hotshot. I remember my first cruise in 1976, when the aft lookout pointed out two smoke trails closing in on the ship at very high speed. Moments later, the two F-14s screamed past the forward superstructure and went vertical. I heard later that the CO was furious that we hadn’t picked up the jets on radar until they were upon us! This was before the installation of the AN/SPS-48 radar we received during the ship’s refitting in the early 1980s. The Aegis-equipped Ticonderoga class cruiser Bunker Hill ahead of Long Beach. , USN Swapping a carrier for a WWII era battleship Long Beach’s deployment as the flagship of the Surface Action Group (SAG) alongside the Iowa class battleship USS New Jersey was a very interesting deployment. We made more port visits that previous cruises but every time we entered a port after Pearl Harbor, the Admiral would helo over to the New Jersey and ride it into port. The New Jersey had an older Chief’s mess. A lot of the crew who had returned to active duty to bring ‘the Jersey’ back to life were still on it. I remember we had a get together at the Chief Petty Officer’s (CPO) Club in Pearl with their mess and at about 2200, their Command Master Chief got up and the entire New Jersey CPO mess returned to the ship. We were surprised, but like good Long Beach sailors, we remained at the club until closing time. USN It was an unusual cruise because of the lack of organic air assets. We were supported by P–3 Orions whenever they were available but otherwise, the only aircraft were the helos (helicopters) belonging to a frigate, a Spruance class destroyer, a Ticonderoga class cruiser, and the replenishment ship in the group. Since Long Beach and New Jersey both lacked helo hangers, neither one had its own helo. We never went anywhere at flank speed since the other ships in the group were all oil burners. I remember the papers in Hong Kong were impressed but I don’t think the Navy brass was too thrilled, especially the naval air contingent. I seem to recall hearing rumblings and references to when the Japanese sank Prince of Wales and Repulse. It was interesting seeing a broadside fired from those 16-inch guns. I also recall that New Jersey spent a lot of time steaming with one shaft locked because of a problem. Ships, like all other machinery, do wear out from age. We hosted the New Jersey’s Cheng (Chief Engineer) to watch the way we conducted engineering drills and he said he was amazed. He claimed that we ran far more complex engineering casualty drill than they could. The other memory from this cruise that stands out was the lack of mail. Without a carrier and its embarked CODs ( Carrier Onboard Delivery planes ), you don’t receive the same amount of mail nor the frequency of it. This wouldn’t be much of a problem in today’s internet age, though. USN A Desert Storm rolls through the U.S. Navy Although I was not stationed on a ship at the time of Desert Storm, this was the start of an increased operations tempo for the fleet. One of the first effects of the increased tempo was the start of a program called ‘stop loss,’ which was designed to retain personnel with skills that were in short supply. The mood was generally upbeat and most of the people I came in contact with understood the need to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait. The Navy had already been on an increased alert in the Arabian Gulf since the tanker escorts during the Iraq-Iran war. During my last deployment on Long Beach , we were near the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz while some of our destroyers shot up an Iranian oil platform after some belligerent action from Iran. I remember hearing the Iranians scrambled some of their F-4 Phantoms from an airbase and as soon as they lifted off we lit them up with our missile guidance radar and they decided to fly north, away from the action. I’m sure they were aware there was only one ship capable of taking them out from afar, the good ship Long Beach . Another memory I have from that general time was after the Iraqis had been driven from Kuwait, I was being flown to Bahrain from the Nimitz along with some of my fellow NPMTT (Nuclear Propulsion Mobile Training Team) and the C-2 COD landed in Kuwait City to drop off some Kuwaiti VIPs. We were allowed to get off the plane to stretch for a bit before continuing on. The smoke from the oil field fires was so thick that I couldn’t see my own hand in front of my face!  I remember thinking ‘this is probably taking a few years off of my lifespan!’ Those COD pilots were awesome for being able to land in that horrendous mess. An F-14 hangs over oil fires in the aftermath of Desert Storm., USN On a deployment aboard USS Fox— a ship that we’ll discuss in a moment — we were tasked with intercepting any of the Iraqis trying to smuggle oil to circumvent the restrictions imposed at the end of Desert Storm. According to the rules of engagement at that time, if we had an unknown contact, an aircraft or vessel not responding to our challenges, close to within three miles of our position, we were allowed to fire at them. At one point we had an airborne contact that was just skirting the three-mile boundary and not responding to our calls, so the CO had the ship close on it! As soon as we started to close, the contact identified itself as a helicopter from the logistics group based in Bahrain. I’m sure that helo driver got quite the thrill when his radar warning receiver started blaring because he quickly identified himself! Making Senior Chief My advancement to Senior Chief was the only time in my career when I didn’t get promoted the first time I was eligible. Since I was a nuclear-trained Electrician’s Mate, I was hampered by the number of quotas available. Still, I believe that because of my service on Long Beach , I was able to demonstrate the leadership to be selected for the rank of E8. Around the same time, I was in charge of the Long Beach’s Engineering Casualty Training Team and we earned our first ‘excellent’ overall on our Operation Reactor Safeguards Examination. We’d seen some of the newer Virginia class cruisers earn an excellent but I had been told by some that Long Beach was too old to be able to get an excellent grade, but we earned it. I believe it was because of that I was invited to serve on the CNSP/CNAP (SurfPac/AirPac) Nuclear Propulsion Mobile Training Team (NPMTT). This meant that I would be training nuclear trained electrical operators on cruisers and carriers in the Pacific Fleet. I would be helping the ships prepare for their Operational Reactor Safeguards Examinations. I was also sent to Career Counselor’s School in San Diego so I could advise and assist Pacific Fleet nuclear trained enlisted personnel on their assignments and careers. This position required a lot of traveling throughout the Pacific Fleet operating area. I also got to know the Commanding Officers of the nuclear ships and most of the Engineering and Reactor departments on the ships, especially the key personnel. Being a Senior Chief and part of the NPMTT, I noticed what I said seemed to carry more weight than before, even when I was a Chief. While on the NPMTT, I was selected for promotion to Master Chief the first time eligible again. USN Once I had decided to make a career in the Navy, my goal had been to become a Chief Petty Officer like my father. Once I made Chief, my goal was to become a Master Chief like he had been and once a Master Chief I knew I wanted to be a Command Master Chief. Becoming a Command Master Chief means going through a selection process even more stringent than being selected for Master Chief. Since I was nuclear trained, I had to obtain a release from Naval Reactors. By virtue of my having been a career counselor for the Pacific Fleet nuclear enlisted personnel and working closely with the nuclear-enlisted assignments at Navy Personnel Command, I knew that all of the sea duty billets for nuclear Master Chief Electrician’s were filled so that Naval Reactors (NR) wouldn’t have any concrete objections. Even when I was selected for promotion to Master Chief, I knew there were a limited number of quotas to advance and I knew who the other Senior Chief nuke Electricians were that were eligible, it was that small of a community. I was sure I would be one of the top three and I ended up being number two since I had only 17 years service and the top guy had over 20 years service. I thought that once selected as a Command Master Chief, I would be sent overseas as I had not been stationed overseas because of being a ‘surface nuke.’ I told the assignment person that I just wanted a ship and where didn’t matter. A few days later he called me back and told me I was assigned to the USS Fox (CG-33) homeported in San Diego! I was sent to the Navy’s Senior Enlisted Academy in Newport, Rhode Island from October until the middle of December of 1991. I was one of two Master Chiefs in the class and junior to the other one so I was the class vice president. I was excited to be going to my first tour as a Command Master Chief (CMC) and also found out that a Senior Chief in the class was going to the Fox as well. After Christmas, I flew out to the Arabian Gulf to join Fox on deployment. Courtest of Douglas Healey Welcome aboard the USS Fox! Although Fox was twenty-five years old when I reported as Command Master Chief, it was exceptionally clean, in great shape and had a superb reputation in the Pacific Fleet. It was an incredible experience since the Master Chief who preceded me had been sent home to retire before I reported. I heard from the Chiefs in the mess that he was short-tempered and tyrannical. I’d learned to observe and not make snap decisions and sudden changes. The first night underway from Dubai I was awakened at 2:30am by the announcing system calling for General Quarters because of a Class B (fuel oil) fire in number two fire room. It only took a couple of seconds to realize that was immediately below my berthing! The fire went out as quickly as it started. Apparently, some of the lagging (insulation) around the base of a fuel feed pump was giving off smoke and a watchstander in the space noticed it and when he peeled back the lagging there was a brief flash of fire. Another watchstander noticed the flash and called in the fire. There was no actual fire but the crew responded admirably. I met with the Commanding Officer later in the day once we were at our patrol station in the Arabian Gulf. A few days later, during one of our daily chats, the CO asked me how it felt being on a conventionally fueled ship. I told him it wasn’t bad but the refueling every three days or so wasn’t any fun. I also commented that I hadn’t realized that it got so chilly in the Gulf in the winter. USS Fox on patrol, USN One major difference I noticed fairly quickly was that the non-nuclear-trained sailors I knew would object quickly and strenuously to policies they disagreed with and were not reluctant to let everyone know about their discontent. One of the first policies I changed was I observed the engineering watchstanders were not allowed to eat on the mess decks ( dining area ) in their fire-retardant coveralls but the engineering Chief Petty Officers ate in the Chief’s mess in their coveralls. I asked why the crew wasn’t allowed to eat in their coveralls and was told it was the Chief Cook’s policy. I promptly informed the Chiefs that they couldn’t eat in their coveralls and was met with a loud outburst. After they calmed down, I asked the engineering chiefs if they were willing to work with me to change the Chief Cook’s mind. I spoke with the Chief Cook, the Food Service Officer and the Supply Officer and convinced them that the crew should be able to eat in their coveralls as long as they were not covered in grease and grime. The junior enlisted engineers were on a five hours on and ten hours off watch rotation (three section rotation) and did not have an abundance of free time to be changing their uniforms between standing watches, working eating and sleeping. I didn’t make too many other changes other than altering the conduct of the CPO disciplinary review board. I changed it from being a butt chewing session to a fact-finding session. I don’t believe the engineers on nuclear ships worked any harder than those on the conventionally fueled ships, the nuclear-trained sailors just had better opportunities. Fox bows out On my second and last deployment aboard USS Fox , we had a port visit in Singapore. As was tradition, while in port athletic contests were set up among the sailors off of the various ships in the group. Fox’s basketball team handily defeated the one from the USS White Plains . As young men are known to do on occasion, there were words exchanged later at the Junior Sailors Club on the Singapore Naval Base. Apparently, after a while, a full-fledged fight occurred. The next morning the Commanding Officers and Command Master Chiefs of both ships were summoned to the Battlegroup Commander’s cabin on the USS Abraham Lincoln . We were told that the crews of both ships were confined to their respective ships. In thirty years of service, this was the one and only time I was restricted to my ship. After a couple of days, the restriction was lifted and my Captain and I visited the White Plains where I was told by the White Plains’ Command Master Chief that he wasn’t surprised because his crew got into fights with other ships’ crews in their home port in Guam. This alerted me to the fact that young sailors were becoming more prone to quick flashes of violence over trivial matters. These quick leaps to violence are something I’ve noticed outside of the military as well. Once upon a time, there might have been fights between crews, but they would pass quickly and then all would go for a few drinks together. Now it seems as though the anger remains and the level of violence appears to escalate rapidly. I met with Fox’s enlisted leaders and promptly informed them that further fighting with other ships’ crews would not be tolerated and would adversely affect the supervisors’ performance reviews. We had no further incidents with other ships’ crews. Fox was a well maintained and expertly operated ship. Fox’s last Commanding Officer, in particular, was an expert ship handler. We were pier-side in Manama, Bahrain on the inboard side of the pier and were supposed to get underway to meet up with the Lincoln . After waiting on the harbor pilot for an exceptionally long time, he ordered the ship to get ready to depart. The harbor pilot showed up, we cast off lines. The pilot wanted to wait for the tugs but the Captain told him to sit out on the bridge wing and smoke while he got the ship underway without the benefit of tugs. He effortlessly got the ship underway without damaging the pier or the ship. Later, when we were back in San Diego and prepared for de-commissioning the ship. The Captain had the numbers and the ship’s name painted in bright white, the way it used to be done. As we prepared for our decommissioning ceremony, we pointed out to the crew the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG 54) was preparing for commissioning at the end of the same pier. It’s the circle of life for Navy ships. Popularpatch.com Saying Goodbye to Long Beach and the Navy’s nuclear surface combatant force I was sad to see Long Beach retired. When I transferred from Fox , I was assigned as the Command Master Chief for Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. I was on travel when Long Beach was de-commissioned and unable to attend the ceremony. I was also not in San Diego when the Long Beach’s stripped hull was towed out of San Diego Bay on its way the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. I was sent the pictures of the hull and it saddened me to see what was left of a once proud ship. Long Beach in Norfolk before she was stripped of her superstructure and mission systems., USN Since Long Beach was a ‘one-off,’ it would not have made sense to try to extend its life further. The hull may have been in good shape but a lot of the machinery inside had passed its planned life expectancy. The manufacturers for a lot of the equipment were no longer even in existence. For the rest of the nuclear surface combatants, they could have served further, however, the cost of their refueling and the manpower required to keep them going was beyond what the Navy decided it could afford. The Arkansas had a crew complement of about 450, a Ticonderoga class cruiser about 370 and an Arleigh Burke destroyer has about 340, so a major factor is the cost of manning the ships, not just once but over the expected life of the vessel. The nuclear ships just weren’t efficient in that respect. The Navy had studied converting Long Beach into an Aegis-equipped nuclear cruiser. This would have included a full rework of her upper deck superstructures, but the concept never made it to fruition., Public Domain Back to the future Helping to bring the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Higgins to life was a new experience for me as it was designed from the keel up to have a mix of men and women in the crew. Fortunately for me, I served as the base Command Master Chief at the Amphibious Base in Coronado which had both male and female sailors manning the installation. Another major difference for me was that I had a hand in selecting the crew for Higgins . I noticed quickly that some of the other DDGs (guided missile destroyers) in the construction pipeline were filling some of the positions that we still needed to fill. I was told by the new construction desk at the Navy Personnel Command that we were already near our ‘allotted number’ of female crew members! I explained to the individual at the other end of the phone line that we had three types of berthing for enlisted sailors. We had ‘male’ berthing, ‘female berthing’ and ‘neutral’ berthing. You may be wondering, what’s the difference? Male berthing has urinals in the heads (bathrooms), neutral berthing did not have urinals in the heads and female berthing didn’t have urinals in the heads and had two doors with a tiny atrium between the entryway. We were also having trouble manning some of the middle-level enlisted personnel (PO2s or E5s). I spoke with the Captain and Executive Officer and explained that we could get sailors, but we would have to accept graduates right out of the technical training schools instead of getting an experienced PO2s from the fleet. They agreed it would be better to be fully manned but I had to convince my fellow Chief Petty Officers. I met with the CPOs and informed them of the plan and there was some mild resistance. I explained to them that the only ‘bad’ habits their sailors would have would be the ones they, the supervisors, gave them. The end result was we sailed away from Bath Iron Works in Maine as fully manned with 348 sailors. We were told that Higgins was the first DDG they had seen sail away from the building yard with all billets filled. It wasn’t much of a gamble as new construction ships are rarely thrown into the breach. There’s a bunch of hoops the ship and crew must pass through to be certified as fully operational. Higgins was commissioned at Port Everglades, Florida in April of 1999 and we sailed through the Panama Canal on our way to our future home port of San Diego. Along the way, we drilled repeatedly to ensure we would be ready for action if needed. It paid off as we excelled at our early inspections and certifications and I am sure Higgins’ reputation was a factor in my selection as the eleventh Force Master Chief for Naval Surface Forces Pacific (SURFPAC). Newly minted Higgins on the Hudson., Courtesy of Douglas Healey Force Master Chief The SURFPAC Force Master Chief’s job description states “…serves as an adviser to the Commander on matters affecting enlisted personnel and their families” and is also a conduit between the Chief Petty Officer’s messes in the force and the Commander and serves as a member of the Chief Of Naval Operations/Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (CNO/MCPON) Senior Enlisted Advisory Panel. The Force Master Chief works closely with the Fleet Master Chiefs and the MCPON in developing policies and procedures to recommend to CNO for matters affecting the enlisted force. As a part of the CNO/MCPON Senior Enlisted Advisory Panel, one item I was especially proud of was getting sea pay authorized for ranks E3 and below. Before this, a sailor had to be an E4 and senior to get paid sea pay. In my opinion, the junior sailors, especially E3s and below, are some of the hardest working sailors in the Navy and yet, if they are assigned to shore duty they could possibly earn more money than those assigned to a ship. A shore duty sailor can be paid to not eat in the mess hall and even be paid to live off the base, whereas a sailor on a ship is expected to eat and live on the ship. The difference in money earned could be about $300 or more a month. The Admiral I worked for at the time told me, perhaps in jest, that he wasn’t in favor of E3 and below getting sea pay because it meant that ensigns (O1s) would get sea pay also. I replied to him that I didn’t care if ensigns got sea pay or not but that I felt the hardest working sailors should earn the additional money and I would fight to get it for them. Normally it takes a few years to get something like this approved but the Secretary of the Navy was able to find enough money in the budget to make it happen. Force Master Chief Healey looking very much the part!, Courtesy of Douglas Healey Another item I was proud of being a significant part of was the revisions made to boot camp. We were losing a significant number of young men and women to life-altering orthopedic injuries and needed to put an end to the losses. The Navy training Force Master Chief had a study that showed sailors marched as much if not more than the other branches of the Defense Department and the work shoes issued to the sailors were crappy. The Navy Special Warfare community (SEALs) had a flexible boot they used that was comfortable. We asked the manufacturer if they could make it with a steel toe and were told it was possible. Also, the ‘running’ shoes issued to the recruits weren’t very good and we were able to switch to some made in the USA by New Balance (which have an ‘N’ on the sides as a bonus) for physical fitness training. We also made other changes to the training provided to recruits to improve the quality of sailors reaching the fleet. Making room for the Navy’s next Master Chiefs Retirement and moving on is almost always a challenge, however, you must remember I was promoted to Master Chief with only 17 years in the Navy and there can only be a limited number of Master Chiefs in the Navy. I believe the limit is about one percent of the entire enlisted force, so from the time I was promoted until I retired, I limited the number of Master Chief spots that were available for others seeking promotion. If it were possible and I could have moved into a position where I could have been effective, I might have considered asking to stay in the Navy but it was time for me to move on to the next phase of life. After retirement, I went to college and moved away from San Diego. Five quick and interesting facts about USS Long Beach It was built keel up as a cruiser and was originally considered for launching intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBMs before the nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) were proven successful and was later considered for launching the Regulus cruise missile. The box shape of the forward superstructure was for an early form of phased array radar that swept 360 degrees electronically rather than having a rotating radar antenna. Long Beach had teak decks in the forward quarter deck area and a Marine detachment like the cruisers and battleships of World War II. The ship was originally designed with an all-missile armament, the two five-inch gun mounts amidships were put on after initial ship’s sea trials. At one time, Long Beach was one of the tallest ships in the Navy. Before a refit in the early 1980s, the ship was too tall to fit under the Coronado Bridge in San Diego. When Long Beach was on plane guard station astern of a carrier, the landing pattern for pilots had to be altered because of the ship’s height.  It was so tall that when you were on the bridge, you looked down on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. An early conceptual rendering of what would eventually become USS Long Beach , America’s first nuclear surface combatant., Public Domain A troubled fleet Our Navy’s current inventory of ships is insufficient to meet the demands being placed upon the force. The surface force ship construction and maintenance budgets have been woefully inadequate to meet the Navy’s requirements. I was told by an admiral that for years the surface ship maintenance budget has been understated and then the understated budget has been underfunded. It would seem to an outside observer (which I am) that the Navy doesn’t seem to have a well thought out plan to modernize and maintain the fleet it already has. Too often, the Navy’s shipbuilding plans would appear to be driven by rewarding congressional districts and corporations instead of meeting the nation’s needs and its national requirements. A lack of foresight for designing, developing and bringing new ships into the fleet seems to be a major factor as well. The Littoral Combat Ship is coming online without all of the mission modules to meet the Navy’s operational requirements for the ships and the Zumwalt class would appear impressive to the uninformed but it has guns without a projectile to shoot. The only currently successful shipbuilding program is the Arleigh Burke class destroyers, but just like the carrier air wings today, it looks like we’re headed toward a surface combatant fleet comprised of one type (Super Hornet). We cannot have all our surface combatant force made up of a single ship design, that being DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class. The newest Ticonderoga class cruiser, USS Port Royal , was commissioned in 1994 and there was no follow-on cruiser design. The newest frigate, USS Ingraham, was commissioned in 1989 and de-commissioned in 2014. Clearly, there’s been a lack of foresight in surface combatant design and development. Independence class LCS in dry dock, a place where these ships are far too often. , USN Russian Nuclear Cruiser Counterparts I do not recall any discussions about the Russian Kirov class cruisers among Long Beach’s crew during my time stationed on that ship. During my first tour on the ship (1975 – 1978), the Kirov was not operational in the Pacific and we saw more of the Kynda class cruisers in the then Soviet fleet. Our main concerns were the numbers of weapon systems on each Russian vessel. We learned upon the collapse of the former Soviet Union the main reason for the volume of weapon systems on Russian ships was to ensure that one of them would work. The nuclear powered Kirov class battlecruiser Frunze seen in 1984. , DoD Safety of nuclear-powered fighting ships Regarding the safety of the naval nuclear power plants, while all former sailors sign a debriefing notice regarding what can and can’t be released, I can unequivocally say while I was serving, we did not have any ‘sketchy’ moments. On the contrary, I remember as a newbie thinking that some of the safety precautions seemed to run contrary with the mission of a warship. Later in my career, I realized there were exceptions for battle conditions. Both enlisted and officer nuclear-trained personnel go through extensive, rigorous training before they ever set foot on their first ship or sub. Even though it was 1950s technology, the Long Beach’s reactor plants were very safe. The crews train constantly to prepare for unexpected casualties. I do not remember any close calls. Enterprise had the severe flight deck fire in January 1969 and the nuclear plant was never in danger. Without going into classified material, there are systems designed to put the reactor plant into a safe condition if the worst occurs. The Navy has had two subs sunk, Thresher and Scorpion and to my knowledge, there hasn’t been a problem as a result. Granted, anything made by man can fail at any time, it is the quality of the training received by the personnel operating the reactor plants that is the best defense we have against a major issue with the nuclear plant. The Navy also has a rigorous inspection process that nuclear ships go through at least annually. The inspections thoroughly evaluate the material condition of the reactor plant, the knowledge level of the nuclear operators and their readiness to respond to casualties. The casualties are simulated, but the level of the training is such that the simulations are very realistic. The ability of the ship’s engineers to conduct the casualty control training is also evaluated. The first concern evaluated is do the ship’s engineers safely operate the reactor plant? The nuclear-trained personnel are required to know the immediate actions necessary to put the plant in a safe condition and then check the established procedures for follow up actions as required. When the nuclear propulsion program was established, Admiral Rickover reportedly stated that “he could train monkeys to flip switches” when needed but he wanted his operators to understand how their actions affected the plant operation. Overall, I believe the Navy’s history of safe reactor plant operation speaks for itself. USN The Navy’s ship collision problem For as long as I can remember there have been collisions between ships. I think the disappointing aspect of the recent collisions among 7th Fleet surface warships is an apparent over-reliance on technology today. I do not understand why it appears that neither ship had lookouts with their ‘mark 1 mod 0’ eyeballs available to spot other ships in the vicinity but instead seemed to rely upon radar or other technology. I wonder if, in a way, to reduce the ship’s manpower, the number of lookouts were reduced, maybe even to zero? I think the Navy should immediately require, as a minimum, port and starboard lookouts be stationed. Regarding the operations tempo of the Pacific Fleet’s forward deployed naval forces, this is a situation that’s been known for quite some time. Additionally, as I stated before, surface warship maintenance has been underfunded for quite some time. These are not new problems and it is a fallacy to think that anyone above the level of the respective destroyer squadron commanders are seriously being held responsible for the situation. Sure, the 7th Fleet Commander had to retire earlier than he’d planned and the same goes for the Pacific Fleet Commander, who might have been selected for overall Pacific Command if not for the collisions, and the SURFPAC commander retired as well, but realistically speaking, the retirement of three or four star admirals is not a punishment. The bottom line here is that our Navy, especially the surface forces, need to get back to basics regarding seamanship. USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) loaded onto the heavy lift transport MV Treasure a fter a deadly collision., USN Recruitment and today’s Navy Recruiting has traditionally been a challenge for the military, especially when the economy is booming. It is challenging to locate, recruit and train the sailors needed to man the Navy of today, much less tomorrow’s Navy. The challenge becomes even greater when we consider that fewer future sailors have been around someone who served. We also have leaders that have not served and do not always have an understanding of what it takes to man a carrier battlegroup. One program that was in existence when I was at SURFPAC was called ‘Leaders To Sea,’ where educational and business leaders were sent out to ships operating in the San Diego operating area to see how their Navy performed at sea. I believe through programs like that and incentives provided to Recruiting Command it is possible to meet the Navy’s goals for recruiting and retaining quality personnel to meet the manning requirements. A recent USN recruiting ad. , USN Words of wisdom for prospective sailors Talk to family members and friends and if possible visit a Navy command and see how it operates. I think that a fair number of young men and women still have ‘seeing the world’ as one of the reasons they choose the Navy over say the Air Force. Future sailors should all be aware that they can’t all be Maverick in Top Gun or on a sub like the new film Hunter Killer and although the star of the television show The Last Ship is a flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer, they aren’t most likely going to be chasing a viral cure all over the globe. I just I hope they enter the Navy with some goals in mind and do their best to pursue those goals. Three basic things that would result in a more effective Navy today One of the things that made our Navy great during the Second World War was its ability to fall back on the training, especially damage control training the sailors received. Technology is important but the basics such as seamanship and damage control are very important. The Navy needs to really focus on these basics again. There should be a fully cohesive plan for modernizing and maintaining the fleet. Listen to the sailors, a time-honored saying in the Navy is ‘ask the Chief.’ I would extend it to the rest of the sailors as well. USN Three key elements that make a great leader, according to a Force Master Chief One of the best elements is the ability to listen. I was told years ago there was a reason that we were given two ears and two eyes but only one mouth. Listen to your people and observe them. Realize they want to do the best job they possibly can when given the opportunity. I was fortunate to have served with some of the best natural leaders and I watched and learned from them continuously. People need some time to decompress. Encourage your people to take time to get away from the job from time to time. They will usually come back refreshed and ready to excel even more. Also, pay attention to the interaction young people have with their shipmates and families. This can be an early indicator if there are problems ahead for them. Recognize your own weaknesses and strive to minimize them. Remember that life is a learning process itself. Also, proper delegation not only eases your burden but also gives your people opportunities to excel.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just a month before the Berlin Wall would begin to fall, the U.S. Navy and its allies in the Pacific held a gargantuan set of naval drills dubbed Pacific Exercise 1989, or PACEX ’89 for short. It was the largest combined allied armada since the end of World War II and worked as a symbolic showcase of the Reagan military buildup that played a significant hand in breaking the Soviet Union. In total, some 54 vessels of U.S., Korean, Japanese, and Canadian origins—as well as a number of submarines that were never disclosed—combined forces to show just how outgunned Russia was in the Pacific and how they could operate together as a cohesive fighting force. On the last day of the drills, a photo exercise (PHOTOEX) was held that was so big, none of the images have all the ships in-frame. Helicopter camera ships and F-14s equipped with Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod Systems (TARPS) were launched to capture the historic gathering. The F-14 TARPS image, seen at the top of this article, is remarkably impressive not just for the size of the fleet shown, but for the powerhouse vessels that make up its central core. USN These include the aircraft carriers USS Enterprise (CVN-65) and USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) , the battleships USS New Jersey (BB-62) and USS Missouri (BB-63) , the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser USS Long Beach (CGN-9) and the amphibious command and control ship USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19) . A number of the cutting-edge Ticonderoga class guided missile cruisers are also seen flanking the central lineup of capital ships. Not only is this an incredibly impressive amount of firepower, but its origins span from World War II to the late 1980s, when the photo was taken. What’s even more amazing is that more ships, including with two additional carrier battle groups, those of the USS Constellation (CV-64) and USS Midway (CV-41), also took part in the exercise. Popularpatch.com The battleships seen in these images, in particular, were pulled from retirement and regenerated as part of President Reagan’s ‘ 600 ship Navy ‘ initiative. In the end, the upgraded battleships would only serve a handful of years in front-line service before being put back into mothballs following their participation Operation Desert Storm and the demise of the Soviet Union. Five years later, the one of a kind and historic Long Beach would also be pulled from service, along with the rest of the nuclear-powered surface combatant force not long after. https://youtube.com/watch?v=H8e5sgjI4Zg PACEX ’89 was truly a unique moment in history that one can appreciate, but as current headlines frequently describe ever larger allied military drills in response to the rising threat posed by Russia and China, it really isn’t an era that one wants to repeat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Impractical To Tactical: Omani Royal Yacht Transforms Into Navy Training Vessel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The superyacht universe is intriguing due to its exclusivity alone, but there is some incredible engineering going into these ultra luxurious vessels. Sometimes that includes taking what was tactical and turning into the practical—or impractical when it comes to economic frugality. We have seen old frigate hulls reborn into new cutting-edge personal luxury liners. And sometimes, the reverse occurs—older yachts morph into military vessels. This is exactly the case with the Royal Navy of Oman’s Al-Mabrukah training ship. Now wearing a muted gray paint scheme of the Royal Navy of Oman and stripped of any external signs of luxury, the vessel served a far different role up until recently. The latest photo of Al-Mabrukah was posted on Twitter by Jeremy Binnie of Jane’s Defense Weekly: The 340-foot long pleasure yacht was built by renowned Italian shipbuilder Picchiotti in 1982 for Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Its ornate interior was designed by local interior design group Oman Rys and it’s accouterments were largely preserved during an extensive refit in 2009. In fact, the ship’s motif looks similar to an Omani Royal Flight 747-SP of the same era. You can see a complete set of photos of the exterior and interior here . The lineage of the ship itself, and especially the shell game of monikers it has sailed under, is as confusing as it is interesting. It was named for Al-Said for nearly 25 years. Whatever ship is serving as the principal royal yacht for Oman’s Sultan is always named Al-Said after the country’s ruling family. With only a small number of ships in the Royal Navy of Oman overall, the country routinely recycles other names, as well. The replacement Al-Said is nearly 170 feet longer than its predecessor and about three times the displacement. , Qatarperegrine/wikicommons When Oman took delivery of the present Al-Said— a 508 foot long megayacht built by Germany’s Lurssen shipyard and delivered in 2008—it shifted this older yacht to the country’s Ministry of Tourism, where it gained the name Loaloat Al-Behar — translated ‘Pearl of The Seas’ in English. Now, after the better part of a decade acting as a charter vessel, she has ended up joining in the Omani Navy as a training ship under the name Al-Mabrukah. The previous Al-Mabrukah , which had the pennant number Q30, had itself served as the Al-Said yacht until 1983, when she also became a naval training ship. In 1997, Oman began using her a patrol ship and pulled the ship from service altogether in 2014. Cyprus bought that ship, renamed it the Alasia , and commissioned her in February 2017 (shown in the tweet below). You can see exactly what the Loaloat Al-Behar interior’s interior looked like after her late 2000s refit in the awesomely bad charter promotion reel below. It was quite lavish considering the age of the hull, but in a nostalgic sense and was still dated in appearance by modern high-tech superyacht standards. The vessel was could fetch up to around $290,000 per week for exclusive charter excursions. It remains unclear as to the current interior configuration of the yacht turned training ship or if it still serves in some sort of VIP, liaison, or entertainment role of any kind. In fact, the vessel appears to have been for sale for an unknown amount of money prior to it being ported over to the Royal Navy of Oman. Who knows, maybe for the right price the ship could be acquired today . But considering that Oman is supposedly happy gifting one of the world’s most expensive private jets to a friendly ruler , it’s not like the oil-rich sultanate really needs the money. Still, with its helicopter landing pad, ample small boat storage, and plenty of space—during its charter days it could sail with a crew of 80 and up to 180 passengers for day excursions and 28 guests in 14 cabins on longer charters—maybe the newly minted Al-Mabrukah will end up serving as a naval patrol ship like its predecessor. So there you have it, the Al-Said turned Loaloat Al-Behar turned Al-Mabrukah, yet another odd-ball story in the sometimes happy and sometimes tragic lives of the world’s largest yachts. The Loaloat Al Behar before turning into a Navy training vessel. , Marc Parris/Charterworld.com Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can’t track test flights of clandestine experimental aircraft flying out of Area 51 with flight tracking apps and websites, but you can track the tankers that support some of those operations. Often times, tankers out of Travis AFB with the callsign ‘SIERA 99’ or ‘SIERA 98’ will support more mundane test duties over the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), but a tiny fleet of dedicated test tankers based out of the heart of the USAF’s flight test apparatus at Edwards AFB will provide much-needed fuel to very secretive flying machines. One of these flights was especially peculiar, occurring on September 20th, 2018 and taking place right over Area 51 that sits deep inside the NTTR under its own super-restricted airspace. The white and gray painted NKC-135R test tankers of Edwards AFB are very busy, with one airframe, serial 61-0320, flying a lot throughout 2018 (you can check these flights out for yourselves here on adsbexchange.com ). These flights take place all over the western United States. They include elongated racetrack shaped routes over Oregon and Washington in support of Boeing’s KC-46 program , flights out over the Southern California test ranges around the Channel Islands, and even deeper south, into an expansive and remote military operating areas across from the Baja Peninsula. But 61-0320’s most prolific flight profile is orbiting near Edwards AFB and supporting ongoing aircraft test programs at the base. Still, judging by the aircraft’s flight logs, it seems that its presence around Area 51, usually in the witching hour, has become increasingly in demand. NKC-130R 61-0320 refueling an F-35A high over California., USAF Normally, these missions seem to take place abreast or on the periphery of ‘The Box’ of highly restricted airspace over and surrounding Groom Lake /Area 51, which roughly measures 23 miles wide and 25 miles long. But on September 20th, 2018 the NKC-135, with no callsign, flew repeated routes at various speeds right over the secretive flight test facility. As you can see in the plot below, just before entering what is the most restricted airspace on the planet, the tanker held over Tonopah Test Range Airport . It could have ‘picked up’ an asset sortieing out of there before flying into ‘The Box’ or it could have just been holding overhead, we just don’t know. The first half of 61-0320’s flight on September 20th, 2018., adsbexchange.com The whole affair began at about 11pm local time, with the tanker spending four hours crisscrossing over and very near Groom Lake before heading southwest before disappearing. By this time it was nearly 3am and it remains unclear if the aircraft flew back to Edwards or recovered at Area 51 or Tonopah Test Range Airport. You can see the entire route for yourself here . It is worth noting that there is an error in the software that connected two flights into one. The next day, some ten hours later, the same jet flew a number of tracks over a desolate area north of Mojave Air and Space Port, before taking a straight route toward the coast—one that seems ideally suited for keeping over sparsely populated areas. The 61-0320 went ‘feet wet’ south of Grover Beach and north of Vandenberg AFB . Once it was on station a few dozen miles off the coast, directly adjacent to Vandenberg, the NKC-135 began doing racetrack refueling patterns. At times, the data, which is not always perfectly accurate, shows that it tracked abruptly inland before heading back out to sea. By the time the flight, now under the “GHOST 57” callsign, was descending into Edwards, it was nearly 5pm. Once again, this is a separate mission from the one over Area 51 the night before but the software bridged it into a single continuous track. The second sortie of 61-0320 that occurred the day after the flight over Area 51 but the software bridged it into one single track., adsbexchange.com 61-0320 is just one of two NKC-135Rs left in the inventory according to the KC-135 ‘bible’ written by Robert Hopkins. They are modified test tankers so if any tanker would be set up for such operations it would be them. As I mentioned at the start of this piece, other tankers support test flights based on the workload at any given time, but it’s probably safe to say the NKC-135 of the 418th Flight Test Squadron gets the most sensitive and challenging missions and even ones that require modifications to the tanker itself. This is likely an increasingly important necessity for advanced unmanned aircraft test operations . We have explored the unique and dynamic job of a KC-135 boom operator in the past, including the special job of refueling secret assets on test flights. You can read that entire feature here , but this is the part that relates most directly to this article: “Secret aircraft need gas too, and they get it at the hands of qualified booms sitting in the back of KC-10 and KC-135 tankers just like the rest of the unclassified fleet does, but the process is a little different. Edwards AFB has two refueling squadrons, although I only know of one KC-135 they actually own although it may be more now. The squadrons are the 445th FLTS (active duty) and the 370th FLTS (guard). The 445th [now the 418th Flight Test Squadron] supports all experimental aircraft testing while the 370th supports all developmental aircraft testing, but they both can share aircraft and crews, depending on mission needs and workload. These squadrons do not organically provide enough aerial refueling capability to meet testing demands so Edwards AFB calls for active and guard refueling squadrons from all over the US to go there for two week TDY’s (temporary duty assignments). Usually these include two jets and crews, except during busy times, like when a new aircraft is in full developmental testing mode, such as the F-22 in the late ’90s and early 2000s or the F-35 today. My first TDY to Edwards was in the early 2000s and my last was in 2006. We belonged to the 445 FLTS during our time there and you have to have a top secret clearance, not an interim clearance (all booms have top secret clearances or interim clearances for SIOP purposes ). When we left our home base, we were expecting to be there for F-22 support, at least that’s what our paperwork said. But when you get there it’s hit or miss what you actually get to refuel. If your flight plan is going into the “box” area tracks (restricted airspace surrounding Area 51), most likely you are going to have security with you (but not always), and most likely your going to see something maybe a few dozen people have seen before, depending on the compartmentalization of the project. It is very exciting to see what actually shows up on the boom to say the least. These two week missions consisted of flying every morning or night for around 3-4 hours and culminated with leaving on the second Friday, heading back to hour home base. If you were one of the lucky ones to see a black project, then the 445th Squadron Commander and Chief Boom Operator gave you the infamous tanker black world patch. It’s also known as a “Friday” or “morale patch.” I got mine as a fresh instructor Boom much to the jealousy of fellow Booms back home. We also got a certificate that was actually classified secret and had to be carried in our “secrets” bag. When returning to our home base, the certificates were displayed in the top-secret SIOP briefing room located in “The Vault” for everyone to see. That certificate was the first time I’ve seen the six stars used in conjunction with Area 51. Five stars representing the “5” and the additional star representing the “1” in the base’s designation. You can see the same stars on many clandestine program patches that were test flown out of Area 51. As for the certificate itself, unfortunately, I can’t share what else was on it. The patch, on the other hand, featured “Spooky” (from the Spy vs Spy comics), and our motto “Nobody Kicks Ass Without Tanker Gas…Nobody!” I was actually part of a lucky crew that flew into “a test facility in the center of the Nellis Range Complex” for a SCI briefing on a particular jet I would be refueling. It was a first actual offload to said jet ever. So it was pretty cool to be able to do the honors. Once again, our primary mission when TDY to Edwards AFB was for F-22 flight development and testing support. We took off right after they did and landed when they were done. They got all the gas they needed on the mission, which usually lasted three hours or so. And of course, we had unexpected guests from time to time like the Gray F-117s from the Skunkworks plant located over at Palmdale, as well as some other “unique” aircraft operating in the area that I cannot describe.” USAF/Public Domain Patch Art But once again, if you look at the flights of 61-0320 over the last year, and there are many into the NTTR area, they rarely cross directly over or even very near the base and never do so over and over in a tight pattern like the flight on September 20th did. There are other unusual flights of 61-0320 over the last year, but none quite as bizarre as the one described above. Beyond the regular refueling flights over the Mojave Desert, here are some interesting examples of other areas 61-0320 regularly services. 61-0320 spends a lot of its time supporting tests over the Pacific, adjacent to Vandenberg AFB., adsbexchange.com This track is one of many long routes over Oregon and Washington likey in support of KC-46 developments. , adsbexchange.com The NKC-135R often ventured far south of the Channel Islands to an area off of the Baja Coast that is a frequently used as a training ground for Navy carriers and their escorts., adsbexchange.com 61-0320 often flies into the NTTR, but stays on the western edge of the box of restricted airspace directly over Area 51. , adsbexchange.com This route took 61-0320 up and down the California Coast. It also flies regularly over the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains., adsbexchange.com This is the most common type of route (but not by all that much) for 61-0320, supporting test flights directly over or very near Edwards AFB., adsbexchange.com We have no way of knowing what test program the NKC-135R 61-0320 was supporting that required its presence directly overhead Groom Lake for hours on end on that September night, but it’s another reminder of just how active these tankers are in supporting clandestine aircraft development operations. The old adage we often come back to here at The War Zone is Nobody Kicks Ass Without Tanker Gas, often abbreviated as NKAWTG. It rings true whether it be for thirsty fighters over a war zone , special operations aircraft about to penetrate contested airspace at low-level, or even some exotic experimental aircraft being tested over America’s most notorious yet mysterious air base . In the end, America’s aerial refuelers are intrinsic to making it all happen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 20, 2020",China’s J-20 Stealth Fighter Stuns By Brandishing Full Load Of Missiles At Zhuhai Air Show,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the last day of China’s biennial air show and weapons expo in Zhuhai , a pair of the country’s J-20 heavy stealth fighters added a surprise twist to their routine—they popped open their weapons bays and showed off full magazines of missiles. This is the first time such a full load of weapons has been fully exposed and the first time China has officially shown off the jet’s complete internal weapons configuration in the flesh. What we see isn’t necessarily surprising, but it is interesting nonetheless. In the main ventral bays, the J-20 is carrying four PL-15 medium-to-long-range air-to-air missiles. The type is somewhat analogous to the American AIM-120D AMRAAM . Speculation about what missile actually would hold the PL-15 designation has bounced around a lot, with very long-range missiles and those fitted with throttleable ramjets also potentially receiving the designation, but now it seems the PL-15 is indeed a dual-pulse motor and AESA equipped missile with a similar profile as its predecessor PL-12. The PL-12 is loosely analogous to the AIM-120A/B. Chinese Internet Note that even with their clipped fins, only four PL-15s are mounted in the J-20’s bays in a similar fashion to the YF-22’s missile configuration. It isn’t clear exactly what the launch mechanism for these missiles is based on these photos. A staggered arrangement with six PL-15s may be possible in the future by the looks of the bays, but this depends a lot on the how the missiles are ejected from the bay itself. The F-22 uses a trapeze launcher system to chuck the missiles clear of the bay. The J-20’s main weapons bays also look remarkably uncluttered, which makes one wonder if the missiles are just mounted to static hardpoints inside, but this is doubtful as what appear to be launchers have been visible in the J-20s bays for years. Chinese Internet The most interesting part of this display of the J-20’s lethal payload carrying abilities is the pair of PL-10s deployed on the outside of the jet’s side weapons bays. This novel configuration is one of the most fascinating aspects of the J-20’s design. I was one of the first to point it out and explain its utility back in early 2013, when I wrote the following : “The F-22, a very loose analog for the J-20 ( emphasize very ), uses a canted trapeze that pushes the AIM-9’s seeker out into the air-stream for proper establishment of a lock before launch once the bay doors are swung open. Only once the missile has acquired a target and the pilot ‘receives tone’ (the AIM-9 series has an audible growl as it hunts for a heat source, once it finds one it goes from an intermittent growling sound to a solid tone, cueing the pilot to fire) the missile can be fired and only then do the launch bay doors close up. This method increases the F-22’s radar signature dramatically while also disturbing the airflow around the jet which makes for lower performance and a rougher ride during close-in air combat maneuvering, or dogfighting. Soon, the F-22 will have the AIM-9X Block II which features lock-on after launch data-link capability. In other words, the pilot can ‘acquire’ a target via his or hers onboard sensors, including the hopefully forthcoming Scorpion helmet mounted display… Once the target is ‘virtually locked’ within the AIM-9X Block II’s engagement envelope the pilot can quickly fire the Sidewinder, with the bay doors opening and closing momentarily, and allow the data-link to transfer the acquiring secondary sensor’s info to the missile after it has left the bay in the form of a vector [to the target]. The missile will fly in this prescribed direction so that it can acquire the target itself, at which point the AIM-9X Block II becomes truly ‘fire and forget.’ Once the AIM-9X Block II is integrated into the Raptor, and especially once the helmet mounted display is operational, the F-22’s side bay doors only have to briefly open to let the AIM-9X on its one-way mission. All this begs the question: If China loves copying the US when it comes to weapons systems, why not just build something similar for the J-20 when it comes to deploying its short-range air-to-air missiles? The answer is quite simple, lock-on after launch capability is not an easy one to achieve. It is technologically complex, requires deep systems integration (software architecture permitting), and robust testing using live missiles, and thus it is expensive. China, being the resourceful and cunning folks that they are, figured out a way to employ any new or relatively archaic high-off-bore-sight short ranged air to air missile while keeping the jet’s aerodynamics relatively intact (doors closed during prolonged maneuvering while the missile hangs out on its rail) while also minimizing the impact a ‘deployed missile’ has the J-20’s low radar cross-section. That is right folks, China just said “we don’t want to have to rely on LOAL capability, so why not just temporarily (as in for seconds or minutes) mount a similarly agile, but much less complex and expensive, short ranged air-to-air missile outside of the bay during times when close range combat is imminent?” This is exactly what they did, and honestly, I think it is genius. Radar signature becomes a small factor when fighting for one’s life at close range, having a reliable missile ready to make a u-turn off the rail and subsequently turn your enemy into chaff is so important that is can be seen as a life and death requirement [especially for a big, not remarkably maneuverable fighter]. The alternative, such as the reality the F-22 has faced for the better part of a decade, is that you open the bay up for prolonged periods of time and pay a large penalty in radar cross section and [some] performance. Also, by building a relatively simple contraption, kind of similar to one of those bars that goes on your lap on a roller coaster, albeit with a missile attached, Chinese engineers simplified the launch system and also probably made it much lighter than an F-22 type design. Once again, genius. Another point to be taken from the J-20’s short-range air-to-air missile launch mechanism revelations are that designers absolutely thought it was necessary to give this jet high-off-bore-sight close range missile capability from day one, and in a reliable and persistent nature when needed. This could be due to lack of maneuverability and/or because of its mission, which I have said for years is to break through the enemy’s (American, Taiwanese etc.) fighter cover and take out their enablers (see tankers, AEW&C, C2 and connectivity nodes). In such a case, being electronically silent is your best bet at surviving, so using infra-red passively guided missiles, which require no electronic emissions, at medium-close ranges may be your only play, at least for anything that does not put out a continuous or semi-continuous form of radiation (see AWACS or JSTARS). In that case, a passively guided anti-radiation missile may be the J-20’s weapon of choice, or a medium-long range AAM that can get within locking distance and featuring active radar or IR for terminal homing, via a traditional data-link feeding the J-20’s targeting picture to it provided by passive sensors (IRST, ESM etc). A diagram of how the rail works as well as a shot of it dating back to roughly late 2012 during the J-20’s early testing in Chengdu. , Chinese Internet Here’s a cool little animation of how this system works. Something I would like to emphasize from my original analysis is that the PL-10 that is fired from these side bays is something of a short-to-intermediate range air-to-air missile. This means that in addition to the missile being capable of high-off-boresight shots that are cued via the J-20’s helmet-mounted display or other sensors during a dogfight, it is also capable of near beyond-visual-range engagements as well. Able to reach out over a dozen miles or so (possibly substantially farther according to different assessments), this missile, combined with its ability to ride outside of the J-20’s side-bays, can be used as a silent assassin of sorts. The J-20 can leverage its stealth and sneak up on targets without emitting any electromagnetic energy, using just its advanced passive avionics , which includes electronic surveillance measures, infrared search and track and electro-optical targeting systems, and third-party sensor data fed to it via data-link, to locate its prey. In other words, the J-20 can take advantage of the PL-10 when maximum emissions control tactics are used or when it has snuck up on its target and gets within close, but not yet short-range. Using these methods, the J-20 pilot can also use the PL-10 for offensive tasks when its longer-range missiles are expended. Considering the jet only carries four long-range missiles, at least at this time, being able to wield the PL-10 to its maximum potential is key. Once again, this is in addition to using the missile in classic close-range dogfighting scenarios. Finally, an infrared-guided missile with decent range like this and the ability to hang outside the bay for prolonged periods of time is also a good fallback when fighting in heavy electronic warfare environments as the missile’s imaging infrared seeker is not impacted by electronic warfare tactics. As for the rest of the J-20’s air show display, it looks pretty much exactly as what one would expect from a big, canard-equipped heavy fighter-interceptor that doesn’t possess gobs of excess power. It can roll fairly fast and it can change direction quickly and point its nose decently, but it bleeds energy very fast and energy recovery is likely slow. But extreme agility wasn’t the motivation idea behind this design, so that isn’t surprising. With uprated engines, it will only get more capable in this regard, though. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UVG_I8Ywenw At the air show, the J-20’s designer even teased that the thrust vectoring tech that is now being tested on a modified J-10B, a jet that flew at the show as well, may find itself on the J-20, or maybe it has even already been tested. Equipping the J-20 with thrust vectoring now seems counterproductive as it adds weight to an aircraft that is already in need of more powerful engines. But as time goes on, and as new powerplants are fitted, the weight issue may not be so pressing. Still, the added capability of thrust vectoring is debatable, but as the J-20’s designer stated, it could reduce the J-20’s canard deflections during flight. Fluttering flight control surfaces are not good for a stealthy aircraft’s radar cross-section. This is an issue I have discussed in depth before and one of the biggest knocks against the J-20’s delta-canard design which puts those surfaces—two huge ones in fact—up front where a stealthy aircraft’s radar cross section is most sensitive and important to its survival. So maybe that alone is enough to justify migrating thrust vectoring tech to the J-20. https://youtube.com/watch?v=DRj6q6dGDus China did do something else pretty unique at Zhuhai 2018 in that it appears that they devised a way to allow a J-10 to ‘torch.’ Of course, this operation was made famous by the F-111, and Australia’s ‘Pigs’ in particular . The maneuver, which included dumping fuel and lighting it on fire with the jet’s afterburners, was forbidden in the U.S., at least in the latter years of the F-111’s reign, so it is a bit funny that China seems to have gone out of their way to pull something similar off. It appears as if this ability uses the August 1st Display Team’s smoke oil injector to function. It could also be a malfunction of that system, but I doubt that’s the case. Either way, it’s cool to see a fighter in China torching it up!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The gathering for the Centennial Of The Armistice Of World War I that is occurring in France this weekend couldn’t have come at a better time. The globe is slipping closer toward two new Cold Wars and the potential for a conflict among the world’s most powerful nations in rising with each passing day. In all the excitement surrounding these accelerating geopolitical shifts, we lose sight of just how terrible the situation really can become. The prosperity of huge numbers of lives and the health of this shared spaceship we call Earth literally hangs in the balance. The rhetoric surrounding tensions between the U.S. and Russia, as well as China, has become far more cavalier than it was in the past. A fresh nuclear arms buildup is also emerging, which act as a very costly, and potentially hazardous, adventure in strategic doctrine. Suspicions run deep between the major players and the rulebook that seemed to have even been in place even during the Cold War appears to be disintegrating before our very eyes. What’s more concerning is that the political equilibrium is swinging away from freedom and liberty and toward authoritarianism and nationalism. The very cooperative spirit that built the alliances that kept the world out of a cataclysmic conflict for the better part of a century is showing signs of fracture. There is no doubt we are in far more perilous times than we have been for nearly three decades. So the fact that a collection of American and European leaders, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, sat together today and were given a vivid refresher on the massive losses and suffering that World War I brought to this planet—a clear reminder of how truly un-romantic war actually is and how, above all else, it is best at dehumanizing the individual and destroying the human soul en masse. World War I, the “war to end all wars,” featured human destruction on an industrial level. It was bloody, muddy, diseased, and largely futile. Human flesh became systematic fodder for machine gun fire and gas attacks brought about death in man from the inside out. All the while, the underpinnings of mechanized warfare as we know it today emerged from this conflict. For better or worse, war is the ultimate catalyst of technological innovation. US Army 37-mm gun crew manning their weapon on September 26, 1918 during the World War I Meuse-Argonne (Maas-Argonne) Allied offensive, France., US National Archives The Great War also gave birth to the circumstances that brought about another world conflict twenty years later, World War II. Life as we know it today was largely shaped by that crisis, and the things human’s did during it have blighted mankind for eternity. Yet World War I was so brutal that it doesn’t even get the romance treatment by Hollywood that World War II receives. Movies like Gallipoli and All Quiet On The Western Front left us sitting in shock. In essence, World War I has played as a giant blood stained warning to mankind regarding its own uncanny ability to self-destruct. With all this in mind, getting leaders together from countries that had a direct hand in this horrific waste of human life 100 years ago to collectively face such a glaring and terrible past together provides a sober reminder of what the future could potentially hold. They can sit there and hear the nauseating descriptions of what their predecessors presided over and think to themselves “can I really allow anything like this to really happen on my watch?” Mother and child wearing gas masks, French countryside, 1918., Bibliotheque nationale de France Thankfully, World War I occurred in an era before nuclear weaponry was viable, but today that isn’t the case. World War I was a horrendous affair, but no contraption available then had the ability to unilaterally vaporize an entire city in an instant and gunpowder and gas didn’t have the cumulative ability to end all human life on earth. So yes, this somber gathering in France has far more meaning than a memorial alone. Hopefully, this message sunk in with those sitting in the front row. As we focus our gratitude on those Americans who served their country in uniform, and especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice , it’s most important to remember that if you truly respect and appreciate our service people, then demand that they only be sent to fight conflicts that absolutely couldn’t be avoided and ones with clear objectives where there is truly a steadfast will to win and a realistic path to victory. I hope, for all our sake, and especially those of our soldiers, airman, sailors, and marines, that the specters of World War I visit each VIP seated at that Armistice Day anniversary ceremony in Paris today to remind them of just what’s at stake and how small missteps can turn into a tragedy of global proportions. Above all else, they should be reminded that each name on a military roster has friends, a family, hopes, dreams, talents, and something to give to society in addition to their military service if they so wish to take that route. They could be their sons or daughters. They are not replaceable and they are not forgettable.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Stan Lee Fought The Nazis As A U.S. Army Playwright During WWII,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Legendary comic book writer Stan Lee has passed away at the age of 95. Though most fondly remembered for co-creating world-recognized characters such as Spider-Man and Iron Man , and contributed to the storylines of dozens of others, including Captain America , Lee was also a proud U.S. Army Signal Corps veteran who wrote film scripts and the text of other training and recruitment material during World War II. His work afterward, and that of Marvel , the company where he was editor in chief for decades, continued to serve as a recruiting tool and otherwise often presented positive images of the U.S. military to the masses. Born Stanley Martin Lieber in New York City, New York in 1922 to Romanian-born Jewish immigrants, Lee reportedly enjoyed writing from an early age and graduated early from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx in 1939. He then went on to join the Federal Theatre Project , a federally funded arts program that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had originally created during the Great Depression as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Through family connections, Lee secured a job at Timely Comics, initially performing menial duties for the staff there. In 1940, however, as the Nazis continued to their rampage in Europe, he got his first writing assignment with a filler text story in Captain America Comics #3 . Both the character and the storyline are notable. The very first issue of the series had shown the titular Captain American punching Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in the face. The comic was dated March 1941, but actually hit newsstands more than a year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii that drew the United States formally into World War II. The #3 issue also introduced the character’s iconic star-adorned circular shield. The United States was not at war with Germany, or its Axis allies, when Captain American Comics #1 came out. Stan Lee’s first comic book writing would appear in the third issue., Timely/Marvel Comics Joe Simon , who created Captain America along with Jack Kirby , later made it clear that the character was an overtly political creation . He explained his intent was to make clear his objections both to the Nazis and their supporters, including in the United States , as well as isolationists who argued for the United States to avoid getting embroiled in the expanding war. Simon and Kirby both left Timely in late 1940 over disputes with publisher Martin Goodman, who in turn named Lee as the interim top editor. After the United States entered World War II, Lee, who was then only 19, joined the Army, where he was assigned to the Signal Corps. The legendary Stan Lee later in life., AP The service initially trained the young Lee to install telephone lines , but eventually discovered his writing experience. He says he was given the job title “playwright” and was one of only nine such individuals in the Army at the time. Other members of the group, known as the Signal Corps Training Film Division, were or became famous artists, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning William Saroyan , Charles Addams who created The Addams Family , film director Frank Capra , whose work included Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It’s a Wonderful Life , and Theodor Geisel, who is much better known to the world as prolific children’s author Dr. Seuss . Captain America creators Simon and Kirby also ended up in the military, though the two served in the Coast Guard and Army infantry, respectively. Lee isn’t being apocryphal about the playwright job description, either. At the time, the U.S. Army had a formal Military Occupation Classification, code 288, for this position. The entry from Technical Manual 12-427 , Military Occupational Classification of Enlisted Personnel , dated 1944, describes it as follows: “Writes scenarios and scripts for theatrical, radio, or motion picture productions for entertainment or instruction of military personnel, or for publicity purposes. Creates plots and sequences with instructional narrative, or adapts fictional, nonfictional, or historical material to dramatic form. Bears in mind the characteristics of the medium for which he is writing and forms his presentation and script accordingly. Indicates desired camera procedure, method of presentation, sound effects, and backgrounds. Civilian experience in writing or adapting scripts or scenarios for radio, stage, or motion pictures required.” The official entry on Playwright, Military Occupation Classification Code 288, from the 1944 Technical Manual 12-427, Military Occupational Classification of Enlisted Personnel ., US Army Lee definitely had those qualifications and it’s hardly surprising the Army decided to put him in that role. “I wrote training films, I wrote film scripts, I did posters, I wrote instructional manuals. I was one of the great teachers of our time!” he said in one interview in 2016 . After World War II ended, Lee returned to his job at Timely, which evolved into Marvel in 1961. He remained editor-in-chief until 1972, at which time he succeeded Martin Goodman as publisher. Captain America had been a popular character during World War II, but disappeared from Timely’s regular cast by the end of the 1950s. Stan Lee, working for what had become Marvel, was involved in revitalizing the character in the 1960s. Lee’s own Spider-Man, among the other characters he co-created, has remained a particularly well known comic book icon, as well. “He’s become our Mickey Mouse,” Lee once said of the web-shooting superhero. Lee is remembered for working to advance various social justice causes through his medium, including creating Black Panther , the first mainstream black superhero, and the X-Men , which tackled issues of diversity and inclusivity, in the 1960s. He never shied away from addressing hot-button topics, either, with multiple Spider-Man comics in that decade referencing the Vietnam War , student protests against that war , other forms of political corruption and activism , and other contemporary controversial topics. He always remained proud of his Army service, too. “This is one of my proudest moments,” Lee said at the annual Emerald City Comicon in Seattle, Washington in 2017, where he received a lifetime membership to the Signal Corps Regimental Association and an honorary membership to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, which is stationed at nearby Joint Base Lewis-McChord. “Excelsior!” he added, his signature catchphrase. Marvel, along with license holders in charge of turning the comics into movies, have even established formal relationships with the U.S. military over the years. One of the more recent examples of this was a tie-in with the U.S. Army and 2011’s X-Men: First Class . The upcoming film Captain Marvel , the alter-ego of U.S. Air Force Colonel Carol Danvers in the comics and the movie, looks set to continue reinforcing the link between the Marvel universe and America’s armed forces, if informally in this case. “The world always needs heroes, whether they’re superheroes or not,” Lee said in 2016 . “Since time immemorial there were stories and legends about evil people who had superpowers and some human being had to find a way to conquer them.” Stan Lee was, without a doubt, a cultural force whose influence will continue to be felt in the United States and around the world for decades to come. As the United States observes Veterans Day , it seems worth remembering Lee’s patriotism and service, as well. Excelsior! Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Armies Land U.S. Army"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019","This Isn’t An Early B-2 Cockpit Mockup, It’s For A Previously Undisclosed Special Ops Transport","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman recently released an awesome series of videos that detail the genesis of the B-2 Spirit—the world’s first stealth bomber—via testimony from those who brought it to life. The videos also include a bunch of historical images and video taken during the flying wing bomber’s development . One of these images grabbed my eye as it looked like no Advanced Technology Bomber —the program that gave birth to the B-2—cockpit concept I have ever seen. I reached out to Northrop Grumman about the puzzling photo and what I got back confirmed my suspicions. In the previous article, in which I questioned the photo’s origins, I wrote: “Second is this image of the mockup of a cockpit. The panel layout is vaguely similar to the one that made it into the B-2 but the B-2 has a two-crew side-by-side cockpit. Was this for a technology demonstrator that predated the actual B-2 itself? Maybe the single station was going to be mirrored for the actual aircraft, but there are other oddities. For instance, the panel is smaller, lacking the two lower side-by-side cathode ray multi-function displays. It also has a ‘canopy severance’ handle. The B-2 doesn’t have a canopy but it does have hatches that its ejection seats fire through. A central windscreen support structure also seems to indicate that this is a single seat cockpit concept, or at least a tandem one…” As I subsequently came to find out, the image made it into the B-2 video presentation by mistake—which would be incredibly easy to make. The photo in question doesn’t belong to the B-2 program, at least not directly. Instead, it came about from a previously undisclosed program from the 1990s called the Special Operations Low-Intensity Combat Mission Aircraft. Northrop Grumman We know virtually nothing more about this program or where it ended up developmentally, but it is one in a long line of program names and designations given to the requirement for penetrating tactical transport aircraft that specialize in special operations missions and are in many cases low-observable (stealthy) by design. Following the doomed operation to rescue American hostages in Tehran in 1980, known widely as Operation Eagle Claw , the need for a short-takeoff and landing (STOL) tactical transport capable of penetrating enemy airspace became a high priority. Over the last three and a half decades, the need for something far more survivable has manifested itself via a labyrinth of program names and stated capability requirements—the vast majority of which seem to have evaporated into the dark shadows of the classified world. And it’s not clear if any of them even made it to and especially past the flight testing phase, but there are reports of sightings of aircraft that seem to fit the bill. The sheer number of programs alone makes the idea that none of them ever amounted anything highly questionable. The aftermath of Eagle Claw drastically changed the trajectory of American special operations and the gear they use to accomplish their missions., Public Domain The CV-22 Osprey has satisfied a portion of these requirements after decades of development, but that platform—which uses nap-of-the-earth flight profiles and electronic warfare and other advanced countermeasures to survive in enemy territory—is hard pressed to provide deep infiltration and exfiltration duties in very high-threat environments. Additionally, it was only in May of 2011 that we came to know of a very low-density stealth helicopter capability , but those aircraft are highly limited in terms of range and payload and still rely on low-altitude penetration, bringing into question the extent of their low-observable capabilities. The CV-22 has provided a basic remedy for the penetrating tactical STOL transport requirement problem, but it has its limitations and its ability to pierce through the thickest and most advanced enemy air defense networks will continue to erode as time goes on., USAF Even with the existence of these platforms, the requirements for a stealthy STOL transport not dissipated, with multiple initiatives having been documented as officially ongoing in recent years. So could the Special Operations Low-Intensity Combat Mission Aircraft be out there in an operational form? It is entirely possible. But you can’t really get a good idea of where it may fit into the grander scheme of a potential stealthy special operations transport capability by looking at this scant piece of evidence alone. That’s why we have endeavored to tell a much larger story of the history of these requirements and the many projects they supposedly catalyzed over the decades, some of which included the participation by the most brilliant minds in the aerospace field—including Burt Rutan’s Scaled Composites—which is now owned by Northrop Grumman. So stay tuned, we have been working on our full expose on the mysterious case of America’s missing stealth transports for months, and it should be hitting Thewarzone.com in the coming days.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 13, 2022",This Is What A Northrop F-23A Would’ve Looked Like If It Had Beaten Lockheed’s F-22,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop’s entrant into the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, the YF-23, has become one of the most enigmatic and misunderstood flying machines of the jet fighter age. Today, many are quick to proclaim that it deserved to win against Lockheed’s YF-22. That is certainly debatable, especially considering the aircraft’s unique attributes in relation to the realities of air combat today and the fact that YF-23 checked every box on the USAF’s rubric just like its competitor. Yet one of the questions I get asked the most is what would an F-23A have looked like? The F-22A changed significantly in form from its YF-22 technology demonstrator progenitor and the truth is Northrop’s offering would have as well. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. With that in mind we set out to leverage an array of sources, including the actual blueprints for the proposed pre-production F-23A, and were able to bring the super fighter that could have been to life nearly three decades after it was passed over by the USAF. In this very special installment in our ongoing YF-23 series , we worked with our favorite aerospace artist, Adam Burch of Hangar-B Productions , to show the world exactly what the F-23A would of, or at least could have been. This has been in the works for over five months and it was well worth the wait. The process to create these renderings was painstaking, to say the least. Every detail available was pored over to give birth to the most accurate portrayal anywhere of what this aircraft would have looked like. Late night email exchanges between us were down to single degree cants of the engine nacelles and individual markings on the on the jet’s wings, but mostly I watched as this thing came to life, in awe of Adam’s uncanny ability to make something of a nerd dream of mine materialize. I knew he could do it like nobody else as he already brought Boeing’s F-32 to life in a number of amazingly accurate renderings we shared last Spring. I cannot thank him enough for all his time and effort on this project. It’s rare you work with someone who loves what they do so much and has the talent to really make something magical happen out of thin air. Once again, this is not fan art from the imagination, this is a realization of the real thing as it was going to be. Only the smallest details where specific information wasn’t available were filled in with care. So without further adieu, behold, Northrop’s masterpiece that wasn’t, the F-23A ‘Black Widow II’: Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions You will notice that the F-23A would have been longer and more smoothly molded than the prototype technology demonstrator that came before it. The YF-23’s big trapezoidal nacelles would become more blended into the F-23’s fuselage and its engines would be spaced closer together at slightly toed-in angles. Without the requirements for thrust reversers, which was baked into the YF-23 design but the hardware was never fitted, a more efficient low-observable flap-nozzle could be installed and the flat exhaust troughs would get updated heat-resistant coverings. The F-23’s nose would be redefined to accommodate a powerful active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and its intakes would be drastically changed. Gone was the innovative but high-risk ‘gauzing panels’ that worked to separate turbulent boundary layer air from entering serpentine intakes. In their place was a diverterless supersonic intake-like configuration similar to what is seen today on the F-35 and J-20 , among other aircraft. The intake leading edges would be serrated as well, giving them a menacing look and enhanced low-observable properties. The F-23’s boat-tail would also be simplified, with a simpler overall ‘w’ shape, with the additional indentures found on its YF-23 predecessor deleted. The F-23A’s weapons capacity was expanded and offered more relevant weapons storage than the single bay found on the YF-23. The bays were arranged to carry a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinders in the front bay and four to five AIM-120s in the rear bay. Air-to-ground munitions could also be carried, including much larger weapons than what the F-22 is capable of carrying today due to the greater depth of the F-23’s rear weapons bay. The refueling port would be moved over from the aircraft’s centerline to its left over-wing shoulder position, offering pilots a similar tanking ‘picture’ as the F-15 Eagle. The landing gear would also be strengthened and the ventral barrel section would feature a less acute and more blended mold-line. Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions/YF-23 via Venzo Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions/YF-23 via Venzo Beyond being more refined, the F-23A is a narrower and somewhat elongated design iteration of the YF-23, which would have likely helped improved its already blistering kinematic performance and excellent radar cross-section metrics. But still, as you can see in the scaled illustrations below, the F-23 was to be a beast of a fighter that was overall larger than the F-22 Raptor—the aircraft that became the end result of ATF competition. Even more eye-opening is the F-23 when viewed comparatively to its unofficial namesake, the P-61 Black Widow. Northrop’s legendary night fighter-interceptor of World War II isn’t considered small by any means, quite the opposite, but it’s absolutely dwarfed by the F-23. Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions/YF-23 via Venzo Adam Burch/Hangar-B Productions Here are some thoughts from Adam Burch on his experience raising the F-23A from the dead: “The F-23A model was the result of long hours of research, supposition, dead ends, frustration, fits, starts, and restarts. Above all else, in bringing the ‘Black Widow II’ to life, I drew on my own experience as a professional aerospace engineer, amateur historian, middling pilot, and terrible meteorologist to produce something I hope will do her designers, engineers, maintainers, and pilots proud. I attempted to remain faithful to the reference material wherever possible before succumbing to creativity and shamelessly lifting design cues from production aircraft, such as the F-22A. As with all ‘what if’ projects, there are many questions regarding small details about the final design that may never be answered and that is just fine with this artist! If you’re interested in more of my work you can find it at www.hangar-b.com . I look forward to working closely with The War Zone team in the future to bring more depictions of the musty and unexplored corners of aerospace history to life.” A huge thanks to Adam Burch for showing us what could have been by bringing the F-23A to life in these wonderful images.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Watch This Haunting Video Of Gunner Being Buried At Sea In Badly Damaged Torpedo Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Writing about warfare day-in and day-out for years hardens you to the avalanche of conflict-related imagery and video you see on a daily basis, which ranges from gruesome to heroic. This job literally makes you examine the worst and the best humanity has to offer on a daily basis, but once in a while, a piece of media will really move you by surprise. This happened today when @history1history posted a video of a TBM Avenger gunner being buried at sea with his battle damaged aircraft. Apparently, this is the only time this happened during the war. In the clip, we see the Avenger, which was hit hard by flak, limping back to the carrier. Once it lands, the rear turret gunner’s cockpit is covered up and the aircraft is ceremoniously rolled off the fantail of the ship in a unique burial at sea. You see, Aviation Machinist Mate 2nd Class Loyce Edward Deen’s body was so badly mangled from the anti-aircraft shell that took his life that it couldn’t be removed from the torpedo bomber’s rear cockpit. Deen was just 23 years old when he died on that fateful mission. The operation he was participating in at the time of his death was the Battle Of Manila. It was two hours into a sortie when his Avenger, which belonged to Torpedo Squadron 15 (VT-15) based aboard the USS Essex (CV-9), was hit by anti-aircraft artillery, killing him instantly. Before the Battle of Manila, Deen and his Avenger crew flew in many battles, oftentimes returning to the carrier with their aircraft badly damaged.  He was wounded on one such mission during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Instead of going and recovering on a hospital ship or land base, he elected to stay with his Avenger aircrew on the carrier so that he could return to flight as soon as possible. From left to right: Pilot Robert Cosgrove, Radioman Digby Denzek, and rear turret gunner Loyce Edward Deen. This heroic Avenger team flew in a number of Pacific theater battles. , Public Domain There is a wonderful website dedicated to Deen and his Avenger crew’s heroics during World War II which you can access here . In it, they describe his final day as such: “Each day, reveille was sounded on the USS Essex’s intercom at 5:30 am. Breakfast was served in the mess hall at 6:30am. Throughout the night, the planes scheduled for the next day’s mission were being prepared.  On the flight deck, the Hellcat fighters were in front so they can take off first and protect the group and the carrier. In the rear were the Avenger and Hell Diver bombers and torpedo planes. After breakfast, pilots attended briefings in the ‘Ready Room’ to get their final orders, weather conditions and the plane that was to be assigned to them. That day, Lt. Cosgrove received tail number #93 – a new plane just acquired in Ulithi Atoll a few days ago. Lt. Cosgrove’s orders were to go after the Japanese cruisers in Manila Bay.  After the briefing, Lt. Cosgrove joined his crew, Digby and Loyce, and they went topside to their plane. Loyce climbed into his gun turret for the final time. The VT-15 group took off mid-morning and it would take about two hours to get to the Manila Bay and release the ordinance. There, they encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire from a Japanese cruiser and Loyce was killed from two AA shells. In the 2001 History Channel documentary film “Battle Group Halsey” interview, Capt. Cosgrove recalled, “Denzek told me over the intercom that Deen was hit bad. Then, Densek came back up thru the small passageway to sit in the cabin behind me. He stayed there until we landed.” During the attack, the plane and its controls were heavily damaged.  Lt. Cosgrove had his hands full and used all his strength and skill to return another un-flyable plane.  It was very sad, long and harrowing two-hour flight back to the carrier that included two thunderstorms. Shortly after Loyce’s burial, the USS Essex went into “general quarters” status for the entire evening due to the Kamikaze attacks around them. On November 6th, 12th, 13th and 14th, Lt. Cosgrove courageously got back into a new plane and attacked those same cruisers in the Bay of Manila. On November 15th, Air Group 15 disengaged from combat missions and returned to Ulithi Atoll to be replaced by Air Group 4 from the USS Bunker Hill. At Ulithi Atoll, the surviving 45 members of Air Group 15 transferred to the USS Bunker Hill which was returning to Pearl Harbor for a week. Then, the USS Bunker Hill went to Seattle and brought Air Group 15 home.” It’s amazing to think that Deen launched off the carrier on another mission that day not having any idea that he would not return to the carrier alive, let alone that his mangled corpse would be rolled into the sea along with the aircraft he was flying in. The sheer number of lives that were sacrificed, many in a cruel flash of happenstance, to win World War II is truly chilling, but metrics alone, and even still images, can’t tell the story of just how brutal the conflict was and how undiscriminating and sudden tragedy was doled out during it, like this short piece of footage. An Avenger and its crew getting ready to fly., USN War is a very nasty business and the glory that goes with it is largely manufactured after the fact. Being blown to pieces and tossed off the stern of a ship inside the broken aircraft that you died in just hours earlier is a somber reminder of that.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 5, 2019",The U.S. Sold This Unique Stealth Drone Called ‘Scarab’ To Egypt In The 1980s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier in 2018, Scaled Composites, an aviation company well known for its advanced and novel designs , and now a division of Northrop Grumman, quietly posted a series of previously unreleased images online of a stealthy reconnaissance drone called the Scarab. Decades earlier, Scaled had built an initial batch of the unmanned aircraft on behalf of what was then Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical, who, in turn, sold them to just one customer, Egypt. Teledyne Ryan, which itself became part of Northrop Grumman in 1999, developed the jet-powered, ground-launched Scarab , also known as the Model 324, specifically to meet Egyptian requirements in the early 1980s. Scaled was directly involved throughout the entire design and flight test processes. It’s not entirely clear what the specific impetus was for Egypt’s interest in the drone was, but in 1978, then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had signed the Camp David Accords with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin . This led to a formal peace treaty between the two countries the following year. It also came along with a pledge by the United States, which had mediated the deal, that it would provide both countries with significant amounts of often advanced military aid. To this day, these two countries are among the top recipients of American foreign military assistance. Scarab could have been attractive to the Egyptians as it would have provided an advanced aerial reconnaissance tool that would have been highly survivable against most, if not all of the air defense threats in the broader Middle East region at the time. This means that it could collect details imagery of enemy positions without the need for air superiority to ensure its survival. Scaled Composites employees carry a nose section for a Scarab at the company’s plant in 1988., Scaled Composites The Scarab was definitely a state-of-the-art design at the time with a purpose-built stealth shape . Teledyne Ryan already had years of experience experimenting with stealthier drone designs for the U.S. Air Force, including the AQM-91 Firefly , also known as Compass Arrow, and YQM-98A , or Compass Cope. The Model 324 also featured a lightweight composite airframe, which helped improve its performance and further reduce its radar cross-section. Export laws prevented Teledyne Ryan and Scaled from using carbon fiber, so the latter firm devised a novel “composite sandwich panel structure with fiberglass and Kevlar for skins and PVC foam cores,” according to Scaled’s website . Scarabs under construction at Scaled Composites., Scaled Composites Scaled Composites “Even with these lower-performance materials, Scaled engineering a wing that was strong and stiff enough to accommodate all of the required flight loads,” the company’s profile on the drone continues. “In fact, the vehicle experienced an extreme negative g pitch-over due to a control problem on the first flight, and did not fail any composite components during the ensuing out-of-control event.” Other components of the unmanned aircraft proved extremely durable, as well. This was in part a result of the need for the drone to survive being repeatedly blasted into the air from a ground-based launcher using a modified rocket booster from a Harpoon anti-ship missile . A Scarab on its launcher., Scaled Composites “On one occasion, the 18,000 pound-thrust launch rocket motor exploded at launch and pitched the vehicle approximately 10 feet vertically into the air,” Scaled’s website notes . “The vehicle then fell back into the incinerating launcher and bounced out into the desert. The integrity of the fuel tank was not compromised during this event.” The entire system included a truck-mounted ground control station and power generation system that also served as the prime mover for the trailer-mounted launcher. It’s not clear who built the 8×8 all-wheel-drive truck, but it appears to have an independent suspension system very reminiscent of a family of designs the Standard Manufacturing Company was developing at the same time. The U.S. military tested a variety of the Standard Manufacturing vehicles, including a wheeled self-propelled anti-aircraft gun called Excalibur , but never adopted any of them. The complete Scarab system., SDASM Archives The six-wheeled trailer also had an auxiliary motor to allow crews to more readily move it into its actual launching position when detached from the truck. The truck-and-trailer combination had a maximum speed of 52 miles on improved roads, but also had some off-road capability. A complete system with a Scarab on the launcher was also small enough to fit inside a C-130 cargo plane. After blasting off from its launcher, Scarab could reach a top speed of nearly 650 miles per hour and an altitude of up to 40,000 feet, depending on its predetermined altitude and mission profile, and could carry a payload of more than 250 pounds over a total distance of 1,400 miles. When it returned to base, its small jet engine would cut out and a parachute would deploy. The drone would eventually sail down to earth, landing on a set of inflatable airbags hidden inside the fuselage and wings. The recovery sequence for the Scarab., Teledyne Ryan The Scarab’s Air-Bag Impact Attenuation System (ABIAS), which cushioned it when it hit the ground after parachuting down to Earth., Teledyne Ryan Crews on the ground had a line-of-sight command link that they could use during the beginning and end of the drone’s flight. Beyond the range of that control station, the drone would use pre-programmed waypoints and an inertial navigation guidance system to get to and from the intended area. Later on, Egypt upgraded the Scarabs with a GPS-assisted guidance capability. As delivered, the Scarabs could carry either a KS-153A optical camera or a Loral D-500 infrared laser camera system. The latter used the laser for infrared illumination, allowing the camera to capture images at night. Both cameras, however, employed wet film that required processing after the mission was over. The drone could not transmit any imagery back to base during flight. A graphic showing a typical mission profile and operaional setup for the Scarab., Teledyne Ryan Egypt’s President Sadat, who was assassinated in 1981, never got to see the Scarabs and almost certainly didn’t initiate the program. Scarab’s first flight occurred in 1987 and Sadat’s successor, President Hosni Mubarak , accepted the first examples the following year. Scaled Composites built a total of 29 Scarabs for Teledyne Ryan, which shipped them to Egypt and trained members of the Egyptian Air Force how to fly them. Teledyne Ryan built another 30 Scarabs independently as a second-run and delivered those to Egypt as well. It was the first time Teledyne-Ryan had exported an unmanned aircraft of any kind, which the U.S. military had not adopted, to a foreign country. The Egyptians only established one unit to operate the drones at Kom Awshim Air Base, approximately 50 miles south of Cairo. An Egyptian Scarab launcher in action., via GlobalSecurity.org In 1988, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marines did join together to develop an air- and ground-launched derivative that could be employed both as a target drone and an unmanned reconnaissance platform. Unfortunately, in 1993, the Navy and Marines dropped out of the program. The Air Force could not afford to purchase the drones, then known as the BQM-145A Peregrine , by itself and subsequently canceled the entire project later that year. The Peregrines lack the visually distinctive hump the Scarabs have on top of their rear fuselage, with their twin air intakes being arranged pectorally instead of having a single intake mounted dorsally. Workers roll out one of the prototype BQM-145As., SDASM Archives An undated photo of an F-4 Phantom II fighter jet, privately owned and carrying the US civil registration code N420ES, with a BQM-145A on its centerline pylon during a test., SDASM Archives Of the 59 Scarab drones the Egyptians received, they reportedly never even uncrated 50 of them, according to Scaled . The nine operational examples did fly some 65 operational missions, but there’s no information about what areas they flew over or for what purpose. There are reports that during Operation Desert Storm, the U.S.-led coalition considered asking the Egyptians to commit the Scarabs to help increase overall reconnaissance coverage. True or not, the conflict ended before the drones went to work, though. Regardless of their operational activities, the delivery of the drones to Egypt caused something of a stir inside and outside the United States. The biggest concern was that Egyptians might try to modify the Scarabs into stealthy ground-launched cruise missiles that could have presented a significant threat to other countries in the region and potentially have a destabilizing effect. The Missile Technology Control Regime , a voluntary arms control arrangement covering missiles and unmanned aircraft, which was in place at the time, only prohibits the export of systems that can carry a payload of more than 1,100 pounds to distances greater than 185 miles. This would not cover the Scarab with its stated payload capacity, though it might be possible to increase the payload at the cost of overall range. Either way, Teledyne Ryan did not sell Scarabs to any other customers. An Egyptian Air Force CH-47 Chinook helicopter recovers a Scarab after a launch. The drone’s deployed airbag landing system is visible in black under the fuselage., SDASM Archives The exact status of the remaining Scarabs is unclear. As of the late 1990s, Teledyne Ryan was still actively supporting the program in Egypt. After Northrop Grumman bought the firm in 1999, it took over that support contract. “We are working on a contract with the Egyptians to do upgrades on that aircraft, we are negotiating that as we speak,” Rick Ludwig, then-Director of Unmanned Systems Business Development for Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems, told FlightGlobal in 2006 . “They still fly that aircraft about once a month.” The next year, Northrop Grumman said it was still in talks with Egypt over potentially upgrading the Scarabs, to include new guidance systems and sensors. The addition of digital still or video cameras and a two-way satellite data link to send that imagery back to base in near real time could have significantly improved the drone’s capabilities. The video below includes footage of a Scarab during testing, beginning at 5:33 in the runtime, followed by clips of the air-launched BQM-145A Peregrine. There’s no clear evidence that that upgrade program ever went forward and it may have eventually ended up hampered by political developments. In 2011, Egypt experienced mass protests that led to the ouster of President Mubarak the following year. Then, in 2013, the Egyptian military launched a coup and took power from the subsequent democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi . President Barack Obama subsequently put a freeze on military aid to the country, but lifted those restrictions in 2015 . President Donald Trump’s administration has continued re-establishing military ties with the country and has also advocated for increased American arms sales abroad in general. At this point, the Scarabs, many of which may have been sitting in storage for decades, may be too expensive and impractical to modernize and put to more active use. The idea that the Egyptian Air Force was only flying one of these drones once a month a decade ago doesn’t suggest it was particularly invested in retaining anything but a token capability. All told, the Scarab’s story may end in relative obscurity. Of course, there’s always the chance that someone might uncover one of them in the future still in its crate sitting in an Egyptian warehouse and hopefully send it to a museum.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 22, 2019",Why F-5s Beat Out F-16s For The Navy’s Latest Commercial Aggressor Contract,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Government Accountability Office recently announced it had rejected a protest from the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company , or ATAC, over a U.S. Navy multi-million dollar contract award for “red air” aggressors that went to its less established competitor Tactical Air Support, Inc. , or TacAir. The supporting documentation offers extremely interesting insights into the requirements the service had asked of prospective private contractors and the capabilities those firms offered. The information is especially enlightening as the U.S. Air Force is likely taking similar factors into account as they consider bids for their own massive adversary support deal . GAO only posted its decision online in November 2018, despite having reached its conclusion on Sept. 28, 2018. The decision has been “subject to a GAO Protective Order” and now publicly available in a redacted form. Under the contract, worth $118.9 million over the next five years, TacAir will support the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC) and the Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program, better known as Topgun , both of which are located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon in Nevada. They will also provide aggressor duties for carrier air wing workups which happen a few times throughout the year. A fleet of at least five modified F-5AT jets will fly a combined total of approximately 1,700 hours annually under the fixed-price deal. A fuller description of the basic mission set this new force of private aggressors would provide is described as such in the GAO’s documentation: Pursuant to the PBWS, the awardee was to provide contractor owned, operated, and maintained aircraft for a “wide variety of airborne threat simulation capabilities to train aircraft squadron aircrew and shipboard system operators on how to counter potential enemy advanced airborne threats, tactics, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Electronic Attack (EA) operations.” More specifically, the awardee was to provide “tactically-relevant 4th Generation fighter jets for air-to-air tracking, targeting, and tactical intercept, offensive/defensive counter-air, and air interdiction operations to include associated equipment systems that interface with various platforms and ground force personnel.” Contractor aircraft were to simulate non-western threat aircraft capabilities in an air-to-air environment. So basically, these aircraft would serve in a similar role as Fallon’s resident fleet adversary support unit, VFC-13 , but would be enhanced with, at a minimum, better radars, radar warning receivers, and electronic warfare capabilities. Contract protest “ATAC primarily contends that the aircraft the awardee proposed for performance cannot meet various technical requirements. ATAC also challenges the evaluation of the awardee’s technical risk and price realism, as well as the agency’s best-value determination,” GAO explained in its formal decision . “We deny the protest.” The final bids from both contenders and their risk/confidence scores. , GAO It’s undoubtedly a major blow to ATAC, the incumbent, which has been supporting those training activities for more than 15 years and has provided more than 50,000 hours of adversary support in the process. TacAir’s bid was also less than half the price of ATAC’s proposal, pointing to a potential cost issue that may become a major factor in future adversary contracts, just as it has been in other high-profile U.S. military purchases as of late. One of TacAir’s ex-Jordanian F-5s, which will eventually get upgraded to the F-5AT standard., Frank Crebas/Bluelifeaviation.com ATAC’s pitch had centered on providing ex-Jordanian F-16AM Viper fighter jets, which would have much higher performance than TacAir’s upgraded ex-Jordanian F-5s . However, they would also have been far more expensive to operate and less reliable. Altogether, ATAC had argued that TacAir’s proposal did meet the Navy’s basic performance requirements, it failed to adequately account for the service’s stipulations about radars in the aircraft, did not provide enough planes to begin with, and was unrealistic in terms of the quoted final price for the services. In rejecting each one of these claims, the GAO provided very granular details on TacAir’s winning proposal, many of which are interesting in their own right. A Royal Jordanian Air Force F-16AM taxies past American personnel at Misawa Air Base in Japan during Exercise Eager Lion 2014., USAF Aircraft performance ATAC protested the Navy’s contract award to TacAir in part because it contended that its competitor’s F-5s could not adequately or safely meet various performance requirements. This included arguments that the jets did not meet the Navy’s endurance needs and would not be able to provide “24/7” availability for all missions due to the aircraft’s potential limited ability to fly in certain configurations in hot weather. The Virginia-headquartered incumbent initially asserted that the F-5s would simply not be able to meet the endurance requirement at all. “Upon review of the record, the protester acknowledged that when TacAir’s F-5s were configured with a [redacted] external fuel tank the F-5 would be able to fly the threshold level endurance profile after all,” GAO noted. Endurance mission profile threshold and objective requirements for the contract. , GAO ATAC then claimed that the addition of the single drop tank on the aircraft’s stores station would prohibit the jets from safely taking off when the ambient temperature was over 68 degrees. This, in turn, would render the aircraft unavailable for long endurance missions for much of the year at NAS Fallon, where temperatures routinely exceed that.

TacAir’s aircraft will fly in a similar configuration in support of the US Navy’s training requirements., Chris Lofting via Wikimedia The F-16AMs would have no such restrictions, according to ATAC. TacAir and the Navy countered by saying that ATAC had misinterpreted the performance parameters in the F-5 operator’s manual, deliberately or accidentally, and that the jets would be able to operate with the external tank even if the temperature reached 115 degrees. “We afford particular deference to the technical expertise of agency personnel regarding judgments that involve matters of human life and safety,” GAO said. The watchdog also said it could find no actual mention of a 24/7 availability requirement in the Navy’s contracting documentation. “Aviation operations may be limited based on all types of weather,” TacAir had told GAO itself. “For instance, an aircraft, such as the one proposed by Protester, may be restricted from flying or limited in its ability to meet certain performance requirements during a thunderstorm.” ATAC’s final complaint about the performance of F-5s centered on the ability of the aircraft to perform various mission sets, including those requiring certain maneuverability parameters, with the external tank fitted. GAO rejected that argument saying that TacAir had proposed multiple aircraft configurations to meet different mission stipulations and that the Navy had not required the winning party to provide a single type of aircraft in a single configuration to meet all of its needs. A TacAir F-5 destined to become an F-5AT, in a “clean” configuration as it might fly during certain training missions., TacAir Different radars The Navy’s contract required potential contractors to offer aircraft with a sufficiently advanced mechanically scanned array (MSA) radar, as well as provide a path toward potentially adding an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar into at least some of their aircraft. If the service pursues those optional line items, TacAir will need to have one AESA-equipped jet in its fleet within 18 months and a second within 30 months. ATAC argued that the F-16AMs it planned to acquire from Jordan would already come with a suitable MSA radar and that there were already AESAs available on the market specifically for the Viper. Throughout GAO’s discussions, the names of all of the specific types of radars are redacted, but the F-16AM already has an AN/APG-66 MSA type. Raytheon’s Advanced Combat Radar (RACR) or Northrop Grumman’s Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) are AESA radars that can easily slot into the F-16. There are also foreign options, like Israel’s EL/M-2052 and possibly a variant of Selex’s promising ES-05 Raven . https://youtube.com/watch?v=RSVziY1Zwn8 As such, ATAC felt TacAir’s proposal, which involved modifying all of its F-5s with some type of new radar, should have been considered “high risk” rather than “low risk” and counted as a strike against their bid. GAO disagreed, saying it found no clear fault in the other contractor’s plans. TacAir actually put forward three radar options. Based on the information GAO received, the firm will provide the Navy with four aircraft with one type of MSA radar that meets the threshold requirements and a fifth aircraft with a separate, more advanced type. If the Navy opts for the AESA option after that, the small fleet of TacAir aggressors working at NAS Fallon could theoretically end up with three separate radar types of varying capabilities, or at least two types regardless of if the AESA option is executed or not. Although it is not spelled out in the GAO’s report, it is likely that a data-link system will allow the F-5AT fleet, which is receiving a massive avionics upgrade beyond just new radars, to take advantage of the best available radar in the formation. As such, a single high-end radar-equipped jet out of a formation of four aircraft is a huge force multiplier and would help significantly with portraying more capable enemy threat profiles. F-5AT’s new avionics suite is cutting-edge and its open architecture design will allow new systems and capabilities to be added in the future., Garmin/TacAir It is highly unlikely that this means the first four F-5s will retain their very dated and limited AN/APQ-153 or AN/APQ-159 radars originally installed the Tiger II. In addition, TacAir’s website says that its jets have one of or a mix of AN/APG-66s (same radar on earlier block F-16s) and Leonardo Grifo-series pulse-doppler types. TacAir did cite upgraded Brazilian F-5EM , Singaporean F-5S/T , and Thai F-5T aircraft, as well as the F-20 Tigershark and F-5E Tiger IV, as examples of the ease of installing improved MSA radars into the aircraft. The F-5EM and F-5S both have Grifo-F radars, while the F-5T has an Elta EL/M-2032 , another popular compact pulse-doppler type. There is no evidence that TacAir’s F-5AT designation has any relation to the Thai F-5T configuration. A Brazilian Air Force F-5EM., Brazilian Air Force The F-20, an advanced F-5 derivative Northrop unsuccessfully pitched to the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and other customers in the 1980s, featured General Electric’s AN/APG-67 . This radar is still found in other light fighters, like Taiwan’s AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo and Korean Aerospace Industries’ FA-50 . It is possible that TacAir could end up equipping its initial F-5ATs with this radar set, but more capable and more plentiful systems are now available. GAO said TacAir also provided a detailed schedule outlining its plans to install an AESA radar into another aircraft if required. Though we don’t know what type of radar the company has in mind, and as we noted earlier there are multiple options, Northrop Grumman’s SABR would be particularly attractive considering the company that makes it is the F-5 OEM and is already doing the rehabilitation on the company’s airframes at their facility St. Augustine, Florida . It is also a cutting-edge system that would provide many years of relevance and big capabilities to the F-5AT fleet. Although not entirely conclusive, the GAO’s posting also seems to point to Northrop Grumman’s SABR as the AESA option in the following passage: With respect to TacAir’s solution for AESA capability, the [DELETED] system, the agency points to TacAir’s detailed explanation of how it intended to exceed the RFP’s capability standup requirements and integrate the radar system into its F-5s within 10 months. The agency highlights that TacAir proposed to use the same radar bulkhead modifications that it already planned for its baseline aircraft. Moreover, the Navy specifically notes that the [DELETED] radar would “fit within currently defined power and cooling requirements and support the existing pilot-vehicle interface.” The agency also points out that [DELETED] is the manufacturer of both the [DELETED] and the F-5, and the awardee proposed that [DELETED] would be TacAir’s “partner for aircraft re-assembly, modification, and depot level maintenance.” In fact, according to TacAir, [DELETED] had previously demonstrated system performance with a comparable radar in the F-5E. The dimensional constraints of a modified F-5 nose more in line with the configuration of the one on the F-20 is also stated as evidence that packing a more powerful radar into the F-5’s general design is both possible and has actually been implemented before by the OEM itself. TacAir’s radar modification proposal was more complex than ATACs, but the Navy agreed with the company’s assertion that it followed well-established procedures that have already been used to upgrade 127 F-5s around the world. As such, there was no concern that the upgrades wouldn’t be complete within the required schedule. An F-20 Tigershark., USAF How many planes? Another of ATAC’s contentions was that TacAir would not be able to provide the necessary capacity the Navy had demanded with only five aircraft on the flight line at Fallon. ATAC’s proposal was to have nine F-16AMs on site from the beginning. GAO rejected the argument that the service had “improperly relaxed the requirements by allowing TacAir to ‘get away with only four aircraft,’” stating that the language outlining the requirement in the original contracting documentation was clearcut. However, TacAir had stressed that its five jets would only be an “initial operational capability,” and that it would have 10 aircraft available in total, both at Fallon and in reserve elsewhere, within a year. This would include two AESA-equipped jets if the Navy decided to pursue that option. The Navy told the GAO it was fully aware of the nature of TacAir’s proposal and, as a result, the watchdog deferred to the service’s belief that this would meet its requirements. Having five aircraft on site, with four operational and one in reserve, does meet the bare minimum requirements for the contract, but does raise questions about whether it allows for any surge in training missions, especially in the first year. Though TacAir says that it only expects to fly around 1,700 hours annually, the Navy told GAO that the firm was aware that this number could actually be as high as 2,300 hours per annum. TacAir would need all 10 planned aircraft to meet that demand and has no plans for that added capacity to be available in the first 12 months. TacAir does have the added strength of being located in Reno, Nevada, approximately 60 miles from Fallon, which could allow it to more readily surge aircraft to the Naval Air Station as necessary. It also allows TacAir to more readily swap out aircraft for necessary heavy maintenance and avoid gaps in service. Also, as we noted earlier, a sizable contingent on contractor-maintained F-5s are already located at Fallon. So there may be substantial synergistic impacts of adding more of the same type to the flight line. VFC-13 F-5Ns sitting on the flight line at Fallon., Jerry Gunner/Wikicommons Aircraft fatigue life was also a major factor in the contract tender. With older aircraft, the question of could either company provide enough airframe life with the aircraft allotted to complete the contract was clearly relevant. TacAir, which already owns its F-5s unlike ATAC with its proposed F-16AMs, provided extensive details about each aircraft in their existing stable that would be used to support the contract and it was made clear that they would have no trouble achieving the tender’s maximum flight hour requirements. The issue of only having five aircraft, at least initially, to fly four aircraft missions potentially twice a day (four-turn-four) was also raised with TacAir’s proposal. Under such a scheme the company would have to deliver roughly an 80% mission capable rate. The reality is that F-5s currently flying for the Navy achieve that and more as the type is fairly simple to maintain and operate, especially compared to complex 4th generation fighters. So this argument was also batted down. “Ultimately, while ATAC is unsettled by the prospect of only one spare aircraft on the flight deck – instead of the two spares it proposed to utilize – the Navy did not share ATAC’s concern,” GAO concluded. “We will not sustain a protest where the agency’s evaluation is reasonable, and the protester’s challenges amount to disagreement with the agency’s considered technical judgments regarding the specific elements of an offeror’s proposal.” ‘Price realism’ With all of these other complaints in mind, ATAC’s final argument was that TacAir’s bid, whether or not it met the Navy’s requirements, had an unrealistic total price. “To support its arguments, ATAC performed its own detailed assessment of TacAir’s proposed prices and concluded that the awardee faced ‘extremely significant’ losses as a result of pricing the contract too low,” GAO noted. The Navy actually came to this conclusion itself and asked TacAir to reassess the total cost of its bid, which it did. This implies that the firm original offer was even lower than the final price point of $118.9 million. This is substantiated by earlier reports that the contract was worth less than $106 million . VFC-13 is the resident fleet adversary support squadron at Fallon and it also flies the F-5N/F.  , USN The Navy had also issued the contract as a firm, fixed-price deal, which the service, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, have been increasingly using to help save money and limit risk. As such, there was no specific requirement to analyze TacAir’s cost estimate, since the company would have to accept any cost growth. “Unrealistically low prices or inconsistencies between the technical and cost proposals may be assessed as proposal risk and could be considered a weakness under the technical factor,” was something the Navy had included in its original contracting documentation. However, as noted, it only accepted TacAir’s proposal after revision. The firm had also employed a novel pricing strategy to only charge the Navy depreciation costs for the minimum four operational aircraft. It would effectively eat those costs for the six other aircraft it could end up committing to the red air mission at Fallon over time. It is reasonable to question whether this is a sound business strategy in the long-term and it does carry some inherent risk about whether the company will be able to remain solvent over the course of its contract with the Navy. At the same time, for TacAir, the prospect of any losses was clearly acceptable in order to take over an expanded version of ATAC’s long-held role at Fallon, which could put it in a good position for future contracts if it performs at or above expectations. ATAC’s current fleet includes L-39s, Mk58 Hunters, and F-21 Kfirs, the latter of which has had a near constant presence at Fallon for many years. , ATAC This could be a very relevant issue in the coming years as the U.S. military as a whole continues to expand its use of private contractors to provide “red air” adversaries for training and exercises. Doing so helps reduce the strain on U.S. military personnel and assets, freeing them up for higher priority missions, and reducing costly wear and tear on advanced aircraft while also saving money. It actually enhances training in some ways as well and brings a different perspective and unique gear to the fight. The U.S. Air Force, in particular, wants to begin awarding contracts in 2019 for aggressor support at a dozen locations or more. Those deals could be worth up to $7.5 billion in total between 2019 and 2029. TacAir and ATAC, along with other competitors, such as Draken International , are competing for those contracts. We could easily see one or more of these firms use novel pricing schemes to try and undercut each other. We have already seen similar strategies emerge in major aircraft production deals recently. Boeing secured contracts to build the Air Force’s T-X jet trainers and MH-139 utility helicopters , as well as the Navy’s MQ-25 drone tankers , by offering significantly lower bids than its competitors. Those awards all went unchallenged. A final decision Footnotes in the GAO’s report also give us a glimpse into the other criteria that were examined and scored, although exactly how large an impact these criteria had on the final decision remains unclear. The report states: ATAC’s F-16s met the objective level performance requirements in the following areas: speed, ceiling, turn, endurance, mission recording, identify friend or foe, communications, data links, and electronic warfare. TacAir’s F-5s met the objective level performance requirements in the following areas: ceiling, mission recording, identify friend or foe, communications, data links, infrared captive air training missiles, and electronic warfare. TacAir also was assessed a strength for its radar warning receiver capability. In the end, it was decided that the advantages the F-16 brought to the table just didn’t outweigh the cost difference for this specific mission set. With the GAO summarizing the decision as such: In assigning the proposals outstanding technical ratings, NAVAIR evaluators identified numerous aircraft performance categories where the offerors’ proposed aircraft met or exceeded the objective level performance requirements, as well as other areas where the proposals reduced risk. Specifically, for ATAC’s proposed F-16s, the evaluators assigned strengths for meeting nine objective level performance metrics, and the evaluators identified six proposal features that reduced risk. TacAir’s modified F-5s met seven objective level performance metrics and included one feature that would enhance the training mission, and the proposal contained two aspects that reduced risk. Price evaluators also documented the offerors’ notably different approaches to pricing the fixed-price contract. The evaluators observed that the “large variance” in proposed prices was “largely contained within . . . the price of acquiring, operating, and maintaining the proposed aircraft in baseline configuration.” Specifically, ATAC, which proposed the second highest price of the offerors, included in its proposed price the costs of purchasing all nine of its F-16s and importing the aircraft to the [United States]. TacAir, which already owned its F-5s, included in its lowest-priced solution only the depreciation costs for the RFP-required minimum four aircraft, among other price-saving measures. The evaluators also highlighted that F-5s “typically have lower acquisition and maintenance costs.” The SSEB briefed a source selection advisory council (SSAC) on its evaluation findings… and the SSAC prepared a report recommending that TacAir be awarded the contract. The source selection authority (SSA) thereafter performed a comparative assessment of proposals. In his tradeoff, the SSA plainly acknowledged that the F-16 aircraft had a“performance advantage” over the F-5. The SSA also assessed ATAC’s technical risk as “slightly lower” than the other offerors because the firm had “only a few insignificant modifications to perform on their aircraft.” In addition, ATAC’s past performance was deemed “more advantageous” than TacAir’s “non-relevant” past performance. With respect to price, the SSA documented TacAir’s “pricing strategy” and noted that the firm’s strategy was “the primary cause of the significant positive price delta with the other offerors.” Ultimately, the SSA concurred with the SSAC that TacAir’s proposal represented the best value to the agency. In reaching this conclusion, the SSA noted that while ATAC had an advantage over TacAir under one of the nine technical elements (aircraft performance requirements), all other technical elements were considered “essentially equal for all offerors.” He concluded that TacAir’s “very significant positive price delta . . . far outweigh[ed] the sum of the value of the relative performance benefits of the other offerors and the evaluated past performance advantage of two of the three other offerors.” Taken 2009, this photo of a TacAir L-29 ‘Viper’ trainer at Stead Field in Reno is a good example of TacAir’s less visible but very interesting past. The company has not pioneered the private aggressor marketplace to the scale that ATAC has, but they have been very active in consulting and testing duties for the Pentagon and others. They even seemed to have had a hand in more shadowy affairs, like the purchase and subsequent disappearance of a pair of Su-27s imported from Ukraine and upgraded to like-new condition by Pride Aircraft a decade ago . Many believe those aircraft ended up in the clandestine flight test and foreign materiel exploitation community and are now flown by Red Hat pilots out of Area 51., Tyler Rogoway This decision is really a larger deal than it appears to be at first glance. The Navy went for the cheapest possible option to provide something akin to a 4th generation threat capability and sacrificed performance by way of allowing an upgraded third-generation fighter of a known commodity to take on the role. In other words, the bargain deal won here, and as we mentioned earlier, that is a glaring trend as of late when it comes to Pentagon procurement. With a multitude of commercial adversary support contracts on the horizon, it will be interesting to see if similar strategies prevail and how much excessive low-bidding will become a tactic to buy market share and establish certain relationships with various customer commands. The Navy has operated a small contingent of F-16A/Bs at Fallon for many years and before they arrived the F-16N ruled the Navy’s adversary realm for a short period of time. You can read all about both aircraft and how they came about here .  , NAVAIR The reality is that the F-5 is nothing near to an F-16 when it comes to many aspects of air combat capability. But for beyond visual range applications, aside from a larger radar aperture, an F-5 equipped with a modern radar offers one hell of a bang for the buck without losing all that much in terms of what the enemy looks like to the fleet aviator training against it. The F-5’s small size, both in terms of radar cross section and especially its visual signature, also gives it something of an advantage over the F-16 for this specific mission set. But there is no doubt, the F-16 is a far superior platform that possesses a whole other level of kinematic performance over the F-5, especially in the within visual range fight. That being said, those facts just didn’t provide enough of an edge to make it worth paying over double the price for the same basic services. One has to wonder if ATAC would have been better off putting forward the Dassault Mirage F-1, 63 of which the company has acquired from France to expand and upgrade its aggressor fleet, for this contract instead of the more advanced F-16. The F-1s would have cost less to operate and acquire, would have provided high reliability and decent performance, and the jet can still pack a decent radar. Clearly, ATAC made a highly strategic decision by going with high-end F-16s it didn’t even own for this tender, but in retrospect, it appears to have been the wrong one. ATAC is rapidly making progress in readying our newest aircraft, facilities, and fighter pilots to help train our U.S. military customers. We recently completed the reassembly of our first two French Mirage F1 aircraft at our ATAC-ACE facility in Fort Worth, Texas! pic.twitter.com/TDIFVjQb9g — ATAC (Airborne Tactical Advantage Company) (@ATACTextron) October 4, 2018 You can be sure that the quickly-expanding commercial adversary air-support industry will use this decision and the results of the protest that came after it to inform their future bids and their choices in regards to the aircraft fleets they are looking to procure. If the U.S. defense budget contracts after its recent, but possibly short-lived expansion, America’s air arms will be increasingly forced to solve capacity and cost issues by outsourcing. And tighter budgets will likely result in similar prioritization of savings over excess capabilities when it comes to future adversary air decisions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 30, 2019",This A-10 Warthog Ground Trainer Still Has A ‘Tickler’ Muzzle Device On Its Cannon (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Every year, the U.S. Air Force’s 82nd Training Wing at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas prepares thousands of airmen to become maintainers and munitions specialists, or to improve their skills, and it uses a number of non-flyable aircraft to help with those training courses. But one of its permanently grounded GA-10A Warthogs is also something of a unique historical article with a rarely seen muzzle device , nicknamed “the Tickler,” on its 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger cannon , which operational units only ever used briefly decades ago. On Oct. 10, 2018 , the 82nd’s public affairs office posted otherwise unassuming pictures online of trainees from the 362nd Training Squadron using the GA-10 to practice conducting a landing gear function check. The add-on muzzle device it has was originally supposed to help mitigate the shock and blast of firing the massive gun and help deflect and disperse fumes that could choke out the aircraft’s engines, but proved to be problematic in its own right. We reached out to the Wing for more information about this particular Warthog and they confirmed that it is an instructional trainer airframe. At the time of writing, they had not yet been able to provide the plane’s specific serial number or explain why it still has the muzzle device installed. The unit has received a number of grounded Warthogs over the years, including some of the earliest developmental examples . “The A-10 is one of the hardest planes to take down [for maintenance],” one of the 362nd’s instructors said, according to a caption for one of the pictures. This is “because of all the back-up/emergency systems it has that the pilot can fall back on when worse comes to worst.” A trainee assigned to the 362nd Training Squadron sits in the GA-10A with GFU-16/A at Sheppard Air Force Base., USAF Defense contractor Battelle developed the Tickler, also known more formally as the Gun Gas Diverter or the GFU-16/A, as another safety measure. During development of the Avenger cannon, which occurred in parallel with that of the A-10 itself, it quickly became apparent that without any sort of flash hider or muzzle brake on the end, the gun would blind the pilot during firing. Soot would also build up on the windshield, eventually blocking the pilot’s view in general. On top of that, the gasses the weapon produced as a by-product of firing could end up getting sucked into either of the Warthog’s two engines. These fumes contained no oxygen, which could starve the jets of air and cause them to stall, and might have unburnt gunpowder in them, which could cause even more serious problems. The A-10’s manufacturer, Republic, and the Air Force spent considerable effort during the plane’s developmental period and early service life searching for ways to solve these issues, which we at The War Zone have explored in detail in the past. Battelle’s GFU-16/A was the last of these projects, with work related to the device continuing into the late 1980s. The muzzle brake has two sets of baffles inside intended to eliminate the flash from firing and help disperse the gun gasses before they exit the device. By all accounts, it was quite successful in performing both of these functions. The Air Force sent the GFU-16/As out to various A-10 units, which dutifully installed them on their aircraft. A close-up showing the rear of the GFU-16/A with its two sets of baffles., USAF Unfortunately, the devices also created new and problematic turbulence at the muzzle and magnified the gun’s already severe vibration. This, in turn, led to severe cracking in portions of the forward fuselage, especially inside the gun bay, which became more apparent as time went on. “Although at this time this cracking is not believed to be a flight safety problem, it is a maintenance burden and could have an impact on the operational readiness of the A-10 force,” one 1986 report explained . At that time, the Air Force had initiated a program to “find a solution to the A-10A gun bay fatigue problem by determining the source of the structural fatigue and applying and verifying airframe modifications to achieve the desired structural design life.” A rare, but low-quality image of the Battelle Gun Gas Diverter installed on an operational A-10 in the 1980s., CORBIN H. VIA NETWORK54.COM The source, of course, was the muzzle device. We don’t know the exact results of the flight test program, but what is clear is that the Air Force concluded there was no cost-effective way to fix the problem and quickly ordered units to remove the GFU-16/As permanently. Today, A-10s feature a more traditional-looking muzzle device. The Air Force largely gave up on trying to fight the adverse effects of firing the gun, as well. Warthog pilots can use a special windshield wiping system to clean off the windscreen and pulling the trigger also constantly trips the engine ignition system. So, even if the gasses do cause the engines to fail, they immediately restart. A change in the gunpowder inside the 30mm ammunition also helped mitigate the problem. Watch what happens to the bubble compass to the right of the pilot’s heads-up display in the video below to get a sense of just how much force the GAU-8/A exerts on an A-10 during firing. Still, there are anecdotal reports from as recently as 2007 that some units still had the gun gas diverters sitting around in their parts lockers and, obviously, at least one GA-10A at Sheppard still has its GFU-16/A fitted. Since it is no longer in service, it would serve no training purpose. It doesn’t appear to have any impact on the kind of training that the 362nd uses that airframe for, either, suggesting it was just easier to leave it on. Regardless, it’s still a cool piece of A-10 history, albeit one that might be better served preserved in a museum at this point. The much less exotic look of the muzzle on A-10s today., USAF Update: 11/28/2018— We have received some additional information from Sheppard Air Force Base regarding this aircraft, which is actually a GA-10C and has the serial number 80-0228. The 82nd Training Wing received its first C model instructional aircraft in 2015. When 80-228 arrived, crews removed the Gun Gas Diverter from a GA-10A that was heading to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and installed it on the newer aircraft. The 82nd specifically did this in order to ensure the preservation of this piece of history and students working on the aircraft get a brief description of its origins and purpose during training courses.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just the other day, four Swedish Air Force officers received Air Medals from the U.S. Air Force for a Cold War mission that had remained classified until just last year. On what might have been just any other day in 1987, they had helped escort a stricken SR-71 Blackbird spy plane through Sweden’s airspace and on its way to safety, potentially shielding it from any marauding Soviet aircraft. Swedish Air Force Colonel Lars-Eric Blad, Major Roger Moller, Major Krister Sjoberg, and Lieutenant Bo Ignell got their medals during a ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden on Nov. 28, 2018 . The U.S. military as a whole awards Air Medals for singular acts of heroism or other particular meritorious achievements during a flight. Retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonels Duane Noll and Tom Veltri, the pilots aboard the SR-71 during the Cold War incident, were also present. The Swedish aviators also received a painting depicting the event. The Swedish Armed Forces, or Forsvarsmakten , released a picture, seen at the top of this story, of the SR-71 that Ingell had taken at the time. “We will never know what would or could have happened, but because of you, there was no international incident. The U.S. Air Force did not lose an irreplaceable aircraft, and two crew members’ lives were saved,” Noll said during the medal presentation ceremony. “Thank you for being highly skilled and dedicated patriotic fellow aviators.” From left to right, Swedish Air Force Colonel Lars-Erik Blad, Major Roger Moller, Major Krister Sjober and Retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Tom Veltri during the medal ceremony at the US Embassy in Stockholm., USAF On June 29, 1987, Noll and Veltri took off from RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom for missions in the Barents Sea and Baltic Sea, flying at high altitude and using a slanted flight path to gather imagery inside the Soviet Union from international airspace. This would allow the plane to grab imagery of various important sites, including Soviet military facilities in the Kola Peninsula and around the Baltic Sea . During the “Baltic Express” portion of the mission, one of the SR-71’s engines suffered a catastrophic failure. It was not the first time one of the Air Force’s Blackbirds had experienced engine trouble while flying in the region. The plane dropped more than 24,000 feet in a matter of minutes and ended up in Swedish airspace as it turned away from the Soviet Union, according to the Forsvarsmakten . The engine failure wasn’t the only issue the pilots were worried about, though. An SR-71 Blackbird., NASA The Soviet Union had long made it clear that it would shoot down American intelligence gathering aircraft if they penetrated its airspace, making the point particularly felt with the shootdown of CIA pilot Gary Powers in his U-2 in 1960 . Soviet fighter jets also aggressively challenged U.S. spy planes operating in international waters, something present-day Russia continues to do , as well. There is an inherent risk of airspace violations in the narrow confines of the Baltic Sea region in general and Soviets might have been able to argue that the SR-71 had intruded into their territory, if only briefly, as a justification for trying to bring the stricken plane down. “We did not know who would find us first,” Veltri said , adding that he and Noll were concerned about marauding Russian fighters. He continued on to say that he and Noll were thrilled to see the Swedish pilots in their distinctive Saab Viggen fighter jets and were sure from that point on that Soviet jets would keep their distance. Sweden wasn’t and still isn’t a member of the NATO alliance, but has historically found itself more aligned with the bloc than not. During the Cold War, the Swedish military actively patrolled the country’s air, land, and sea borders for intrusions from either side, though. “We were performing an ordinary peacetime operation exercise,” retired Swedish Air Force Major Moller said at the medal ceremony . “Our fighter controller then asked me, ‘are you able to make an interception and identification of a certain interest?’ I thought immediately it must be an SR-71, otherwise he would have mentioned it. But at that time I didn’t know it was the Blackbird.” Moller and Sjoberg were the first on the scene, confirming that it was an SR-71 and that it appeared to be experiencing some sort of malfunction. Noll and Veltri also eventually switched their plane’s transponder to issue the code “7700,” indicating an in-flight emergency. Running low on fuel, Moller and Sjoberg had to return to base, turning things over to Blad and Ignell who had scrambled to relieve them. The Viggens remained at a safe distance from the SR-71, but continued to follow the Blackbird as the crew descended and reduced speed. It was unclear, initially, to the Swedish pilots if their American counterparts would be able to maintain control or would have to bail out. Noll and Veltri were able to get the plane out of Swedish airspace on one engine. After that, they flew into Denmark, a NATO country, and from there into what was then West Germany, another member of the bloc. The Air Force pilots were able to make an emergency landing at the German Navy’s Nordholz Naval Air Base , situated on the North Sea. With the SR-71 safely recovered and the Swedes agreeing not to reveal the extent of the incident publicly, the event remained classified along with the Blackbird’s other operations. The details of the mission became unclassified in 2017 after a standard 30-year declassification period. This also meant that the Air Force could finally honor the Swedish pilots for rending assistance at the time. “That day in 1987 showed us that we can always count on our Swedish partners in times of great peril,” U.S. Air Force Major General John Williams, who serves as the Mobilization Assistant to the head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and Air Forces Africa (AFAFRICA), said at the ceremony , where he personally presented the medals. “Even when there was both political risk and great physical risk in the form of actual danger, there was no hesitation on your part to preserve the pilots on that day.” U.S. Air Force Major General John Williams speaks during the medal ceremony in Stockholm., USAF These sentiments are equally important today given Russia’s increasingly assertive actions in and around Scandinavia and the Baltic region, as part of that country’s shift to a more aggressive foreign policy in general. Russian jets have aggressively intercepted American intelligence aircraft in international airspace in the region in recent years , some of which fled into Swedish airspace . The Kremlin has also violated Sweden’s airspace itself . All of this has increasingly led to discussions in Sweden about potentially joining NATO , which has, in turn, drawn sharp rebukes from Russia. Regardless, the ties between the Swedish armed forces and the alliance have been and are continuing to grow. Sweden recently sent forces to take part in the massive NATO exercise Trident Juncture in Norway, which wrapped up earlier in November 2018. But whatever happens on the geopolitical stage, it’s great to see these Swedish pilots finally receive the credit they deserve for coming to the aid of Noll’s and Veltri when it mattered most.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",George Bush Saved The CIA,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, we didn’t just lose a President and a war hero, we lost an incredible American that served our country his entire life in so many fascinating ways. He was the embodiment of a patriot volunteer, someone who raises their hand for the tough jobs because they know that it needs to be done right. In his career as a public servant, George Bush’s willingness to step into what at the time was a Central Intelligence Agency in freefall was probably the best embodiment of this trait. The time that Bush took the reigns as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was so dismal for the CIA that some were questioning if it would even survive, and if so, in what form. The CIA has a page describing the providence Bush brought to the beleaguered institution, it states in part: An Agency on the Brink The turbulent 1970s came to be known as the “time of troubles” for the CIA. Six different DCIs served within a ten-year timeframe, and the Agency was shrouded in controversy from the Vietnam War and covert action programs leaked to the press. By far the most devastating and consequential leak involved the “ Family Jewels ,” a list compiled for DCI James Schlesinger detailing controversial and, in some cases, illegal activities undertaken by the Agency. By December of 1974, the list had ended up in the hands of investigative journalist Seymour Hersh. President Gerald R. Ford sought to quell public and congressional concern by establishing a blue-ribbon commission led by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller to investigate any domestic espionage by the Agency. Congressional committees led by Representative Otis Pike and Senator Frank Church were formed in early 1975 and aimed to expunge the questionable activities of the CIA in the 1970s. Church referred to the CIA as a “rogue elephant,” claiming it was unsupervised and designed to tell the President what he wanted to hear. Neither committee discovered evidence capable of destroying the Agency, although the hearings decimated the public image of the CIA and the pride of its employees. As the committees continued their investigations into late 1975, the Ford Administration had come to feel that then-DCI William Colby had disclosed more information to Congress than was necessary. This belief, coupled with the harsh reality that a dark cloud now hung over the CIA, led the President to conclude the Agency needed a new sense of morale and a new director who could improve strained relations with Congress. On January 30, 1976, Ford replaced Colby with George H.W. Bush. With the CIA having acquired the public image as a major source of America’s problems, not a solution to them, there were clearly a slew of systemic issues that would have to be solved the hard way in order for The Agency to survive. But who would want such a job? Fixing any sprawling government institution is an extremely perilous task with very questionable chances of success, but doing so with an agency that trades in secrecy, dabbles in assassination and insurrection, and uses secrets as leverage is a whole other untamed animal altogether. Bush who was quickly climbing the political ladder, saw the job as DCI as a political dead-end and fraught with pitfalls, but he clearly didn’t value the risk to his career or political aspirations enough to be an impediment to taking on such a dubious and important challenge. George H.W. Bush was sworn-in at DCI on January 30, 1976. He was the ultimate outsider in the ultimate insider’s agency. But what was remarkable is that his outgoing personality and openness to hearing out and understanding the problems CIA personnel were facing quickly tore down any artificial barriers put up between the rank and file and what was, in reality, a ‘turnaround guy.’ CIA The job quickly went from a reluctant duty to a labor of love. He was fascinated by the camaraderie, secrecy, the creativity, the technology, and everything else that went with working at the CIA. Bush quickly educated himself on all the ins-and-outs of ongoing CIA operations and the critical intelligence products that The Agency was furnishing the military and government decision makers on a daily basis. He wasn’t just a ‘big picture’ executive, he was also an intelligence officer, personally editing important briefs to the National Security Council, and oftentimes presenting them in person so that he could convey his analysis and emphasize key points. He would also bring officers from Langley to brief White House higher-ups and even the President directly, which was a huge change from the more rigid divisions between the CIA rank and file and the Executive Branch in the past. This alone elevated morale at The Agency by instilling a sense that the work individuals do there really mattered and influenced policymaking at the highest levels and often in near-real time. President Ford and DCI Bush at Langley. , CIA Presidential orders that created a new oversight regime and limitations on the CIA’s ability to spy domestically—hard pills to swallow for a spy institution that had run with far fewer strings attached for decades—were also embraced and implemented by Bush. The horrid relationship between the Legislative Branch and the CIA was also a target for Bush to fix. Having been a Congressman himself he had unique insights into the mechanics of the House and Senate and the personalities and preconceived perceptions at play there. With this in mind, he set out to lay the foundation for a robust relationship between The Agency and both houses of Congress. He targeted key power players on The Hill and worked personally to change their perceptions of the CIA and eventually how Congress interacted and oversaw the activities at the spy agency. This work helped spur the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Under this new oversight regime, 15 senators from both sides of the aisle would be briefed on the CIA’s activities and oversee the budgets of the entire intelligence community with the help of a broader picture of its challenges and goals. This was a huge departure from the past when it came to invasive oversight of the CIA and was intrinsic in slowly dissolving the bitterness between America’s elected representation in Washington and the shadowy intelligence community. DCI Bush talking with President Ford in the Oval Office. , Gerald R. Ford Library Bush also made himself available to Congress in a downright relentless manner. He sat and testified to Congress fifty-one times in his year in office, a record that remains unmatched to this very day. Looking back, such an effort is an outstanding example of extreme damage control on an executive level and ushered in a new era of openness between the two government bodies. In effect, it drastically lowered Congress’s hostilities towards the CIA that had been mounting for years prior and fostered an entirely new level of understanding of what the The Agency did, how they did it, and why. In the end, amazingly, Bush possessed the very rare ability to walk the tightrope between being the CIA biggest cheerleader and supporting its corps of dedicated public servants internally while also catalyzing and embracing dramatic change externally. But above all else, he loved the CIA, its people, and its mission. He knew that what it did was absolutely vital to the nation’s survival. CIA He briefed Jimmy Carter directly on intelligence matters during the election. But once Carter he won, although he liked Bush, he decided that keeping him would not be the right choice politically. This turned out to be a great thing. If he had stayed on as DCI he would not have run against Reagan in 1980, and in losing that fight, become the Vice President and eventually the President. It is also very unlikely his son would have been elected President in 2000, either. Upon leaving the CIA, whose image had morphed dramatically over the short time he had been in charge there, Bush stated the following during his farewell address: “I take with me many happy memories. Even the tough, unresolved problems don’t seem so awesome; for they are overshadowed by our successes and by the fact that we do provide the best foreign intelligence in the world. I hope I can find some ways in the years ahead to make the American people understand more fully the greatness that is CIA.” This is just a brief overview of Bush’s long-lasting impact on The Agency that came when it needed it desperately, but the videos below give a much deeper view of the struggles and brilliance that marked his time there. I highly recommend you watch them in full. And yes, everything and everyone in life, and especially when it comes to espionage and intelligence collection, is a mixed bag. Bush’s work at The Agency doesn’t miraculously break this law. But overall and against great odds, he really did get the CIA back on a survivable track that would allow it to be in a good position to confront on the challenges faced during the final period of the Cold War. On a final note, it is often mentioned that of any American, President George H.W. Bush would probably know more of the nation’s secrets than anyone else. That is probably accurate conjecture, with Dick Cheney being another contender. But George Bush was uniquely set up to carry those secrets to the end, his demeanor and a deep sense of service to his country were contributing factors, but also his time as a Bonesman at Yale can’t be discounted either. George H.W. Bush did so many things in his life that any single one of his accomplishments would be big enough to define any other man, but for him, it’s just one of a “thousand points of light” that made up maybe one of the most impressive resumes in American history. Although turning around the CIA is often a footnote in his story, it really was an amazing undertaking and its positive repercussions are still felt to this very day.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 1, 2019",What It’s Like To Work Inside The Navy’s Secretive China Lake Weapons Development Center,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s sprawling Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake has over 1.1 million acres of land and 20,000 square miles of controlled airspace at its disposal as it sits at the heart of the huge R-2508 range complex in central California. There the Navy and an army of contractors pave the way for the future of warfare, testing the newest evolutions in bombs, missiles, cannon shells, electronic warfare and communications systems, and the aircraft that will put much of them to use. These development processes often involve blowing things up in spectacular fashion. The facility is an integral part of the gigantic, but shy weapons test , development , and evaluation ecosystem that spans all 50 states and is essential to maintaining America’s combat edge over its adversaries. Yet knowing about a place like NAWS China Lake is a lot different than having a first-hand account of what it is like to live and work there. Thankfully, Randy Smith, a civilian employee that worked at China Lake in a unique capacity for years, has offered to share his recollections about a place that he learned to love not just for its remote beauty and ‘unique’ technological sights and sounds, but also for the esprit de corps among those who work there, often under tight security restrictions. This is commonly referred to as “the China Lake way” by insiders and Randy gives us a clearer view of what the place and its motto are really all about. How I fell into China Lake Growing up in the Indian Wells Valley is very challenging. The area is desolate and the nearest populated area is an hour and a half drive to Lancaster for shopping, dining, or anything else for that matter. In the times of no internet and nothing else to do there were very limited entertainment opportunities other than partying or riding dirt bikes. For the most part, unless you worked on the base or in the nearby town of Trona at the soda ash processing plants, there weren’t many career opportunities. Being a gearhead growing up I was working at an auto parts store when my fiancé saw a job in the paper for a position on base. I never thought I’d land a job like that, but I interviewed for it and low and behold got hired. Super Hornet flying over Armitage Field which lies at the center of NAWS China Lake., USN I started my working career on the base in Oct of 1989. I was hired on as a courier transporting 14-inch analog tapes that recorded data on various aircraft when they were flight testing missiles, bombs, and certain data pods of the era. I was to be located at a building next to the airfield on the base where you had to have special clearance to even get through the gate. The airfield is north of town as are the many ranges. All these places are located in very remote areas in the desert. You may think there isn’t much out there while traveling north on Highway 395, but the range facilities are filled with radar sites, target areas, and an occasional lone laboratory with some strange engineer who hasn’t seen daylight in four days hanging out most the week by himself. The aircraft that were being tested were A-6Es, AV-8Bs, A-7s, AH-1 Cobras, and many others. I worked for the contractor that oversaw processing the data on those tapes using Honeywell tape machines and converting them to digital tapes for processing on the VAX mainframes by data technicians or for the flight test engineers in charge of the test projects. USN I also traveled to the outer ranges to collect range data tapes that got processed in the same manner. With this job function, I had to get a clearance to just be in sensitive areas which took very little time. I believe the process went so fast because I pretty much grew up in the area so they didn’t have to go far for a background check. I immediately took to fiddling around on the VAX mainframe in my spare time, learning the system and programming various little batch commands to run minor things. In true fashion of what is termed “the China Lake way” where every one civilian and military alike worked together for one common goal. I was able to transition into a data reduction job working on the A-6E Intruder System Weapon Improvement Program (SWIP) within six months because I was learning things so fast and demonstrating my potential. This upward movement was unheard of at the time. Perhaps my boss sensed that I had more to offer than what met the eye and that’s why he hired me, or I just got lucky. It’s all about the data As mentioned earlier, when an aircraft was doing flight test evaluation in the ‘80s and ’90s there were a lot of parts to put together to analyze the data. The data reduction group was where that began. There were not only aircraft tapes to analyze, but also range data tapes that were recorded from the ground stations tracking the aircraft and the test articles. The aircraft tracked time, speed, INS (Inertial Navigation System), weapon release data, and TPSI (Time and Space Position Information), amongst other things. The implementation of GPS and coupling it with aircraft INS data was in its infancy at that time and was not considered reliable for precise data recording purposes at the time. The range tapes were often generated by mobile laser tracking stations that had to be calibrated against objects of known distance prior to the tests. The first part of breaking down the recorded data was to ensure the laser was calibrated correctly. The data from the aircraft was then merged with the range data to determine if the test results were desirable. The aircraft, as well as the weapons they were testing, were equipped with little prism mirrors on various points so that the lasers could see them and record their telemetry at any given moment. I became involved in testing on HARM, Harpoon, cluster munitions, SLAM, and even a little-known project called Tacit Rainbow . At one point I had discovered collisions with the 1553 bus data that was being recorded on an aircraft. I went over to the hanger and had some discussions with the maintenance crew and they had found some loose connections in the bus connectors. They allowed me to sit on the cockpit which is every young man’s dream at one point or another. China Lake A-6E during HARM testing. , USN It was very interesting to see the typewriter style buttons and ancient controls in the A-6. I was also shown the bottom of this aircraft where patches were made to holes caused by ground fire from guys hiding in the rice patties when the plane was flying low over Vietnam. That aircraft was indeed old. Not too long after I started this position the Gulf War began. The flight weapons testing got hot and heavy, but the best part was here I am just some 22-year-old hack local off the street and was put into a position to evaluate testing data in support of the A-6 missions taking place in the Middle East. A year and a half earlier I had never touched a mainframe computer and only watched the aircraft fly in and out of the airfield. This was all new to me and very exciting. Our main focus at the time was the assessment of data generated from MK-20 Rockeye cluster munitions testing on the A-6. As Operation Desert Storm continued into the late stages of the air campaign we got the unique opportunity to perform data reduction in direct support of the bombing operations on the “highway of death” between Kuwait and Iraq. There were a couple of weeks worth of late night data processing for tests related to this event and our results of these tests went directly to the Navy in support of wartime operations. A-6Es about to get loaded up with Mk20s during Operation Desert Storm., Seaforces.org This was a very proud moment for me to be able to participate in helping with the Gulf War effort and we as a group were recognized for our participation by the Navy Department Heads. We each received a plaque with a personal thank you for our efforts for supporting the missions that took place. I display the plaque in my current office to this very day. Stealth encounters In 1992, stealth aircraft were still mysterious to mere mortals of the population at China Lake. Though there was low observable weapon testing at the time, the Navy didn’t have any stealth aircraft in testing. One of the really cool things about China Lake is the Electronic Combat Range that is located east of the main base some 30 miles called Echo Range. It’s remote and mostly hidden in the next valley not too far from the famous Pinnacles that have been stars of movies such as Star Trek and Planet of the Apes. There are many things in that area that are classified to this day, but there are a few things I can talk about what without landing in prison. There are several interesting buildings including one that the Navy made up like a Russian ship with Russian radars for testing of various aircraft attack angles and radar avoidance. There are the various test and data collection facilities along with every type of radar you could imagine or didn’t even know existed. There are what almost looks like UHF antennas that spin and do all kinds of crazy movements and other things that make you feel that you could be fried any moment if they were pointed at you. This range is very unique and from time to time the Air Force buys some range time and flies tests of their aircraft there. The main site for aircraft testing and evaluation for the Air Force on the west coast is located at Edwards Air Force base about an hour and a half away from China Lake. Armitage Field may be the center of NAWS China Lake but the range facilities span for miles in multiple directions. , Google Earth The unique thing about working at the airfield in China Lake was when something cool was flying our direction from Edwards or elsewhere, the word of its presence would spread quickly. At the time, the closest most anyone would get to a B-2 without clearance was a flyover at an air show. This aircraft is one of the most awe-inspiring flying technologies ever to be seen then and now in my opinion. It’s just a beautiful machine to watch fly and makes you feel as if you were watching some alien technology that just entered our atmosphere and was about to start raining destruction. One day we got word that one was heading our direction after a test out on Echo Range and was going to perform a flyby. What we got was far better. We watched as it came over the horizon with two F-16 chase planes in tow. The formation banked to the north and turned back around south and then did a touch and go on the runway while the F-16’s stayed airborne a few feet above it. A group of us were standing on the flight line and had a front row seat to this event as it came whizzing by. The most amazing thing I remember about the experience is we could not hear the B-2 over the F-16’s. It was that quiet and they were that loud. After its awesome touch and go, the aircraft ascended and headed back to Edwards. This event may not seem much, but it was very impressive to see at the time. USAF One of my fonder memories was when a group of F-117s came to the base from Edwards. They were there on an extended trip of several days to do some testing at Echo Range and were temporarily housed in Hanger 3 for maintenance. Of course, the base was buzzing about the presence of them being there. And those of us who were cleared to be out at the airfield got a special treat. We got to go over to the hanger and check them out. When we entered the hanger, we were greeted up close in person by these magnificent pieces of technology. They were cordoned off with red tape and there were air force guards on each corner with their M-16’s poised and ready if someone decided they wanted to do some sort of nefarious deed! This aircraft was still such a sensitive asset and a national treasure that it necessitated having guards even in a restricted area. To view this aircraft two feet in front of you is befuddling at the very least. It had very sharp angles and was so futuristic looking you couldn’t imagine that it was really able to fly, which it couldn’t without flight computers of course. The canopies were closed and there were technicians in white suits and covered shoes working and walking on them in various places. They had jars of what looked like black paint and were touching up the intake and canopy areas on the aircraft to presumably ensure it stayed stealthy. Looking at these things in awe caused me to do something very impulsive and was in hindsight a very bad idea. When the guard closest to me looked the other way, I reached up and touched one of the air sensors on the front of the aircraft real quick. I was thankful that the group of my coworkers that were there didn’t decide that I was being inappropriate and tell on me. To this day I tell the story of how I got to touch an F-117 and lived to talk about it. USAF Later in the week, the F-117s could be seen flying in various places on the ranges. They were interesting to watch because they were actually quite maneuverable. They reminded me of dragonflies darting around in the sky. The sound they made from the engines enclosed inside the airframe was quite interesting as well. One day I was dropping my wife off at her workplace on the base and one was flying over very low with its gear down. It sounded like a cross between a mean weed eater from hell and the Millennium Falcon. There were many other interesting things about working at China Lake, but those two stand out in my mind just because they were so unique at that time. Home on the range Working at the airfield and doing data reduction work was great, but I didn’t make a whole lot of money. Though I was considered a whiz kid for the things I had pulled off I didn’t have a formal secondary education and therefore was limited in the things I could do. I was trying to raise a young family with three kids and was struggling. Since I wasn’t able to move into data analysis or flight test engineering I decided to take a job in the digitizing unit just for the pay increase. This was the job function of pulling the data off the analog tapes and converting it into digital. Spinning tapes was the most boring job you could get into in this arena and the workers are usually referred to as ‘tape apes.’ I then got another position working with an all-new digitizing system called the Loral 8715. This system incorporated the same Honeywell reel to reel system, but it was tied directly into a Vax 4000. This bypassed having to convert to digital format on tape and dumped the data directly into a format that the data reduction programs could work with. It was fun to be involved in as it was new but soon that became routine as well. One day something happened that would alter the course of the career path I was currently on into another deal altogether. The evolution of the PC was starting to kick in. PCs were getting faster with larger internal hard drives, more memory, writable CD ROMs, and of course faster CPUs. One day we received a 486 DX100 in the data reduction area. It had an 8mm tape drive in it. Shortly after we started receiving 8mm tapes that were recorded on a Radar Upgrade AV-8B+ aircraft. The machine’s software broke the data down from that tape much like the 8715s had done, except it was capable of handling more data and the overall system was way less expensive and cumbersome than the 8715 system. I was instantly drawn to the PC because it wasn’t something I had a whole lot of experience with but was highly interested in. Before long I had purchased one for home and spent every night banging away at it learning everything I could. Within a few months, I had learned much about PCs, DOS, and of course Windows software. Another job came up that was a promotion and it was with a group of folks based out of a trailer in the Michelson Lab complex. They were under contract to be essentially on call PC repairmen all over the base. Because this contract was for the entire installation I gained access to just about every area when I got hired. As such, I got to see many cool things that were being worked on around the base and its many ranges. Some of these facilities included the following: The gun range I spent a couple days working on a badly built PC at the gun range. This is where they tested guns like the 16-inch Mark 7 and Mark 8 that were taken directly off battleships and shipped to China Lake for various testing. One of the technicians out there who happened to be a good friend of my father in law (He worked on the base for 30 years) took me out to see a live fire for a reward after I finished working on their PC. Of course, we had to be back about a quarter mile in a firing bunker to keep us safe. When that thing shot it was amazingly loud and concussive even while cocooned in the bunker. You could actually see the round come out and go down range. It was pretty impressive. I also got to see some of the targets and proximity shells they tested with. The targets resembled the 76 ball you see at gas stations except they were unpainted aluminum. What these proximity shells did was pretty wild. When they sensed they were close enough to these ball targets sitting on telephone poles they would explode shrapnel so violently that the balls ended up being literally shredded to bits. Weapons Survivability Lab The Weapons Survivability Lab is located way far north in a desolate area of China Lake. This place is an office building and a concrete shielded area with a huge static stand for mounting aircraft to. They gather up some old F-4s or something like that and strap it to the stand and then they shoot a missile or other implement of destruction at it, recording all the results on high-speed cameras and sensors. I didn’t get to see a test take place but from what I’ve read, considerable amounts of destruction could take place. China Lake’s WSL today., USN CIWS installation This area was relatively new when I was at China Lake. It is also located far north of the other facilities because of the live fire testing. At the time, there were two Phalanx CIWS guns taken from an actual ship that was dry docked for upgrades. They were brought there to test new technologies and were to be returned to that ship after its maintenance was complete. The guns were mounted on each side of a bunker with the controllers being inside the bunker. This bunker had various bits and pieces of shrapnel and aluminum panels lying around in front of which I thought at the time was rather odd. They had a malfunction on one of their PCs and called us to help because there was a test scheduled later in the morning. I went out there and ended up spending a considerable amount of time rebuilding the machine because it was trashed. Because I was there so long I ended up having to stay for the duration of a test they were about to perform and all range access was temporarily locked down during it. For some reason, they didn’t think it was a good idea for me to be driving around on the range when there was live fire targeted on whatever they decided was going to die that day. As I sat and waited I was informed to look out the bulletproof glass and to the south. What I was looking for was a Tomahawk cruise missile and apparently, the CIWS was supposed to shoot it out of the sky. That experience went from being really cool to terrifying within seconds when I spotted the Tomahawk. It dropped down in the valley along with a chase F/A-18 and started heading towards the bunker with us in it. It kept getting closer and closer until I was sure that there was some sort of problem because it appeared to target us in the bunker and I started kissing my ass goodbye. I would say it got within an either of a mile of us when the roar of the CIWS was heard from outside the bunker. It was just above us and to the right and sounded like the skies opened up with the most amazing Ppfffttaaaaaattt sound as it hurled lead at the Tomahawk. The Tomahawk was instantly shredded, but its pieces kept flying along its original trajectory. Some of them landed in front of the bunker still in flames. Then I realized where all the shredded metal came from. SNORT Track The SNORT Track at China Lake wasn’t used a lot in my day. When it did run, the whole valley knew because the rumble from the rocket sled was amazingly loud and echoed everywhere. I got to be there one time when they were executing a test. I don’t recall what they were testing at the time. I believe they had a combo of test rockets they attached to the sled to see how well the whole package would perform. The guys in that facility were really cool and when the test was about to begin, they gathered everyone up and took them to the roof of the building to watch. It’s about a quarter mile away from where the track was, but when that thing lit off, you felt the wave of energy and enormous amount sound it put out. It was amazing. Your insides would literally vibrate. The speed it obtained in such a short time was nothing short of astounding. When the sled reached the shutdown area it travels into several pools that were filled with water. The water flew 25 feet in the air on impact effectively slowing the sled. Baker Range Working at China Lake you meet many different types of people and it seems the further you get out into the ranges the more colorful of people you will find. Baker Range was at the time definitely full of colorful people. It’s also located North of the lakebed way out in the desert. It’s a bombing complex with a huge radar system used to track aircraft and the weapons they drop. The drive out there takes about 45 minutes at real world driving speeds. However, the roads are often speed limited to 45 and even 25 in some areas in the strangest places where there is absolutely nothing. Upon rolling through the gate and parking inside the complex I got chastised first thing in a humorous way that they were tracking me with the radar as I progressed on my way out and I had broken the posted speed limit several times. This was just the beginning. The outside of the radar control station looked more like a WWII shack on some war-torn island in the Pacific. However inside was nice and cool and organized with different viewing panels mounted on the walls. The radar system had an optical layout on it, so you could actually see what the radar was pointed at. They proudly displayed the visual and auto tracking feature on a jackrabbit about two miles down range. The radar followed it on its own as it went about its business and the image was crystal clear like you were 50 yards from it. Pretty impressive. This group let me hang out for a bomb test session with an F-14 out of NAS Point Mugu which was a real treat. Watching that F-14 come in low over the desert at 600 miles an hour 200 feet off the ground was exhilarating. It would get close to the bombing complex and then pull up and release the inert test bombs. They would lob into a pad of real thick sand. After four of those runs, he was out of bombs and left. The range guys asked me if I wanted to go downrange on their ATV’s with them to pick up the bombs. I had to decline, but I wish I could have. MESA We were called out to the new MESA (Missile Engagement Simulation Arena) complex not too long after it had opened for business. Apparently, the whole system used to reposition test items and missile seekers were controlled by a PC that died. MESA is a huge building and in the middle of it was an F-4 Phantom suspended from the ceiling that looked like a toy because the building was so big. The walls were all covered in cone-shaped foam that’s supposed to filter out any background noise that might interfere with testing. Very interesting place. Range Control Center Occasionally I would have to take a trip over to the RCC. This building oversees all testing done in the main China Lake ranges. It’s almost like an airport control tower except there are big screens that showed real-time data and video of the tests being run at the time. Very cool place to spend a couple hours watching the various activities taking place on the ranges. Telemetry Pad “T-pad” is the area where surface information is sent for recording from the various range and radar devices located around the range complexes. I used to have to make trips out there to pick up tapes. Another remote location with some interesting characters. Looking back These are most of the operating areas that I can get into without getting myself in trouble. There are many more in the list I can’t really write about and I’m sure there are new ones that have cropped up since I’ve left. I continued to do PC work at these various places until once again I ran into an under wage scenario. Along with that, I was also wanting to leave the area for my own reasons. A job position came up at White Sands New Mexico and I made probably one of the worst and best decisions in my career and applied for the transfer. My boss knows that I was batshit crazy for volunteering to uproot my family and take them to New Mexico on a drop of a hat, but I happily agreed to it. I wanted to stay close to aircraft operations, but I wanted to make more money too and ended up chasing the dollar. I miss working at China Lake because to me it had everything I ever liked working with, as well as everyone there seemed like family. Nothing would ever compare to working at there in my mind. The minute I left I regretted it and still do to some degree. Not only do I miss working there, but I also miss being in the area. It’s a very unique place.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to military hardware, especially of the sensitive underwater kind, once in a while a photo will pop up that shows something that you never knew existed. That was the case yesterday when Eric Moreno, founder of the popular Reddit page r/submarines , posted a picture on his Twitter account showing what appears to be a CRT navigational director display mounted in front of a conn position on the Sturgeon class nuclear fast attack submarine USS Queenfish (SSN-561) . Supposedly, the photo was taken during an ICEX mission in 1970. After seeing the photo, I asked a few of my submariner sources about it, thinking it is probably a known system that was tested or even deployed for a period of time before. That was not the response I got, none of them had ever heard of it before. Public Domain The system looks remarkably similar to the navigational display found in Grumman A-6 Intruders from the same era. That display, which was absolutely cutting-edge at the time, tied directly to the A-6’s Digital Integrated Attack Navigation Equipment (DIANE) computer system that allowed A-6 crews to make precision bombing runs during the night and in horrible weather and to navigate to and strike their targets at low-level with the aid of terrain following radar. Youtube Gif DIANE and other sensors and systems on the Intruder were tired to the screen, called the Vertical Display Indicator, which acted as a primary flight instrument of the pilot. The screen worked in a similar manner as modern electronic flight instrumentation systems (EFIS) with synthetic vision , but in a far cruder and self-contained manner. It could show the horizon, sky, terrain, as well as the aircraft’s altitude, angle of attack, vertical speed, and heading. A flight director was overlaid for navigation and precision bombing at night and in bad weather guided by DIANE. The display looked positively sci-fi for its time and the likeness to what we see on the CRT monitor mounted on the conn of Queenfish is very intriguing. Vertical Display Indicator screens on different modes in the Intruder., Public Domain It doesn’t take all that much creativity to realize that such a system may have looked very appealing to submariners navigating the depths with no view of the outside world. In fact, maybe the Navy ported over some of the same technology from the A-6 and tied it into the submarine’s complex inertial navigation system (INS), sonar, and other sensors. The conn section from USS Sturgeon on display at the National Submarine Museum in Groton, Connecticut (The central monitor was added as part of the interactive display) , Philwong5176/wikicommons Whatever the story was behind this display, which looks like it belongs in an X-Wing more than a submarine from the 1960s, it had to have been leading class technology at the time. In fact, it was probably so advanced that it wasn’t even effective as we didn’t see digital conn instruments on American submarines until decades later. Even the Los Angeles class boats that followed the Sturgeon class had analog conn instrumentation. , USN It wasn’t until the Seawolf class of the 1990s that digital conn instruments would be standard class-wide. Today, the Virginia class that is currently in production has a conn that looks more like it’s installed in a starship than in a submarine. The conn aborad USS Jimmy Carter , the modified Seawolf class submarine that serves as America’s primary spy and espionage sub., USN Diverging greatly from any past design, the Virginia class jettisons the classic yoke control wheel and the vertical wall of instruments that were staples of past submarine conn stations for a pair of joysticks and a partial cocoon of angled flat panel displays. Another great photo of what this layout looks like can be seen by clicking here . The futuristic conn aboard USS New Mexico (SSN-779). , USN Clearly, this navigation screen mounted in USS Queenfish’s conn was way ahead of its time. Eventually the ability to process and display a slew of positioning and navigational data for sailors driving multi-billion dollar nuclear submarines would become a reality, but considering that the picture in question was supposedly shot nearly 50 years ago, it would be great to know more about just how ambitious the system shown actually was and where it came from in the first place. If anything else, the photo is another stark reminder that America’s murky undersea warfare history still has plenty of secrets to give up. USS Queenfish at the North Pole in August of 1970., USN Update: 9:10pm PST— We have solved this mystery! The person who solved it is our own AncientSubHuntr, The War Zone discussion area’s resident anti-submarine warfare brain trust. According to AncientSubHuntr, here is what this system was, and of course it has a colorful past!: The unexpected snap roll experienced with the leading edge technology presented by the revolutionary USS Albacore (AGSS-569) hull, among other control issues never encountered by submariners, encouraged the USN to develop and evolve a submarine control room philosophy that met these challenges. With the advent of the nuclear submarine, the incredible sustained speeds added encouragement! The overall integration of the “faster” sonar sensors, weapons and processors with a new control philosophy was developed by Electric Boat in the late 1950s….and it was digital !! SUBIC, or SUBmarine Integrated Control, was the overall program which combined these aspects of the submarine as a modern, hydrodynamic and nuclear powered weapon system. One evolutionary appendage of SUBIC was this visual aid to the helmsman called CONALOG (CONtact AnaLOG). CONALOG was part of the Fast-Reaction Submarine Control (FRISCO) system providing the planesman/helmsman with a “path to follow, in the form of a synthetic highway in the sea, on a CRT (the video mixer of which could also display sonar and radar information).” Installed on the USS Shark (SSN-591) in 1961 and subsequently on USS Thresher , Permit and the Sturgeon class SSNs and the Benjamin Franklin class of SSBNs, the submariners quickly grew to hate it!” One former submarine CO recalled that it tended to put watch-standers to sleep”…LOFL! It was so despised, they specifically excluded it from the Los Angeles class SSN design.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The message above was sent by the office of the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet just minutes after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor began. It went out to ships and naval stations throughout the Pacific region and word of it quickly spread beyond. It was the first official correspondence acknowledging an event that would change the course of history in so many ways—one that still hangs over strategic decision making and national security policy to this very day. The telegram was sent at 7:58am on December 7th, 1941 by Lieutenant Commander Logan Ramsey who had just witnessed first-hand low-flying airplanes with big red meatballs on their sides attacking Ford Island. The message informed Navy vessels of the attack, including the carriers that, by a stroke of sheer luck, were out at sea that fateful day and were spared from the onslaught of Yamamoto’s planned waves of aerial bombardment on the strategic American outpost in the Pacific. For two hours and 20 minutes, beginning at 7:55am, Pearl Harbor was bombarded and strafed by Japanese aircraft. In all, 2,403 people on the American side were killed, 55 Japanese also perished in the operation, and 21 ships and 300 aircraft were damaged or entirely destroyed. Visitpearlharbor.org It was a horrendous blow military to the United States, but even more so psychologically. The U.S. could no longer avoid wading into the maelstrom that we now call World War II. The next day, President Roosevelt declared war on Japan and a formal congressional declaration of war against all the Axis Powers would follow three days later. The House of Representatives historical webpage describes how these declarations occurred in the following passage: On this date, the House approved declarations of war against Axis Powers Germany and Italy—just three days after Congress had declared war against Japan. On the morning of December 11, during a rambling speech at the German Reichstag, Adolph Hitler declared war on the United States in accord with the Tripartite Pact of September 27, 1940; Italy followed suit. President Roosevelt’s swift rejoinder requesting a declaration of war against both Axis nations was read to the House by reading clerk Irving Swanson. “The forces endeavoring to enslave the entire world now are moving toward this hemisphere,” Roosevelt wrote. “Rapid and united effort by all of the peoples of the world who are determined to remain free will ensure a world victory of the forces of justice and of righteousness over the forces of savagery and of barbarism.” The House first adopted the war resolution against Germany 393–0, followed moments later by a 399–0 vote to declare war on Italy. In both instances, Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who had voted against the declaration of war on Japan, answered “Present.” Shortly afterward, Frances Bolton of Ohio, who had earlier opposed U.S. intervention in the European conflict, summed up congressional resolve as isolationist sentiment melted away. Bolton told colleagues, “all that is passed. We are at war and there is no place in our lives for anything that will not build up our strength and power, and build it quickly.” After the conclusion of the session, Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn of Texas presented the gavel to reading clerk Swanson in appreciation for having read Roosevelt’s message and taken the roll calls. That gavel is now on display in the Capitol Visitor Center. Often times, there is confusion about the first communique from the attack on Pearl Harbor as it appears on multiple letterheads and in various formats, but that is because those documents are receipts of the message that was transmitted to many locales and ships. For instance, the carrier USS Lexington (CV-2) was on her way to Midway to deliver Marine fighter aircraft when the message came through. The ship’s Executive Officer Wallace “Gotch” Dillon was first to see it come through the teletype machine. This is that version of the message: National Naval Aviation Museum Nearly 12 hours later, the Lexington received an official message that she should be ready to intercept the Japanese fleet and avenge the attack. This would likely have been a suicide mission, but the order to execute that mission never came. Other messages that emanated throughout the day from Oahu were many in number and highly inaccurate due to the fog of war and the very real sense that an invasion of the islands was imminent. In the days after the attack, with security now at its highest state on the smoldering paradise-like island, personnel trying just to get word home that they survived the raid became an exercise in extreme message control and brevity. This is an example of the postcards that servicemembers were allowed to send home to let loved ones know that they had survived the attack: National Naval Aviation Museum Today, 77 years after that horrible day, text messaging is once again a primary form of communication, although our variation of it is far more nimble than the kind our forebearers were using during World War II. But that doesn’t mean it can’t have just as large an impact, in fact, it can be even more impactful due to its widely distributed nature and near instantaneous delivery. This was demonstrated to a disastrous degree recently in the Hawaiian Islands of all places when the government sent out an alert to the population saying a ballistic missile strike was imminent. Chaos, confusion, fear, and eventually anger ensued. Now the President of The United States has their own direct emergency text service via FEMA at their disposal as well. With all this in mind, it’s a bit bewildering to think that 77 years after “the date that will live in infamy,” God forbid there is another attack on the United States, or any other large-scale national emergency, we will probably hear about it first via text message as well.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-117 was officially retired over a decade ago, but it continues to capture imaginations as it mysteriously roars over the deserts of California and Nevada . The aircraft’s genesis , which is largely considered the birth of stealth technology —although there’s a bit more to that story —is absolutely legendary within aerospace, defense, and military history circles. The secrecy surrounding it is, too . The man who took this outstandingly exotic and revolutionary airframe into the air for the very first time was Harold “Hal” Farley Jr.—a Navy fighter pilot turned Grumman test pilot before descending into the shadowy world of Lockheed’s Skunk Works to fly the F-117 Nighthawk . In a remarkably wide-ranging interview with Hal, he goes from discussing being brought into the highly classified program, to describing the unique competitive tension between civilian and military test pilots assigned to elite aerospace development programs, to whether he had ever seen a UFO or not. There are also some great photos and video clips mixed in. Yet the most interesting and historic part of the interview is his recollection of taking the F-117 into the air for the very first time. The flight occurred on June 18th, 1981, at 6AM at Groom Lake . Keep in mind, the F-117 and the stealth technology behind it was still totally new at the time. The Have Blue demonstrator proved that a stealth aircraft could actually fly and evade radars well enough to survive deep in enemy airspace, but YF-117 serial number 79-10780 was the first aircraft that packaged those technologies and many more into a single airframe that could eventually mature into something that could actually go to war. YF-117 in flight. , Public Domain It turns out that even with all of the Skunk Works’ modeling and wind tunnel testing, and with lead ballast installed in the aircraft’s nose to make it more inherently stable and less dependent on its fly-by-wire control system, the YF-117 wasn’t quite ready for stable flight. Check out the awesome interview in full: In the end, Hal Farley became the first “Bandit,” a coveted moniker given to the small group of pilots that flew the F-117 throughout its career.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 3, 2021",This Bolt-On Launcher Can Give Nearly Any Ship The Same Weaponry As A U.S. Navy Destroyer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The folks over at BAE Systems have come up with a fairly novel way to give any ship with some deck space Mark 41 vertical launch system (VLS)-like capability without having to make huge alterations to the guts of the ship, which in many cases wouldn’t even be possible. Dubbed aptly the Adaptive Deck Launcher (ADL), the system provides four cells positioned at an angle that can accommodate the same all-up missile canisters used by standard Mark 41 vertical launch systems like those found on the U.S. Navy’s cruisers and destroyers, as well as many allied surface combatants. The system comes in tactical length, used for quad-packed RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles , anti-submarine rockets, and shorter-ranged anti-ship and land-attack missiles, as well as strike-length that can accommodate anything a full-spec Mark 41 VLS can, including Tomahawk cruise missiles and the latest SM-2 , SM-3 , and SM-6 surface-to-air and ballistic missile defense missiles. Clearly, there are tradeoffs with a launch system like this. First off, it takes up substantial deck space for just four cells (each one can hold four ESSMs). They are also angled, and if fixed in place, the missile may have to burn some of its fuel and energy to get pointed in the right direction after launch. But even with these limitations, the ADL offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and potential to whatever surface platform it is bolted on to. The Mk 41 is an amazing launch system, and it comes in different sizes and configurations, but it requires a deep void in the ship to accommodate it. , Lockheed Martin For instance, this system could be added to ‘Gator Navy’ amphibious transport docks and dock landing ships , as well as the Navy’s new Expeditionary Mobile Bases , and even some of our allies’ most prominent vessels , giving them the ability to carry various missiles of their own, including standoff land-attack and anti-ship missiles and ESSMs for organic self-protection. This would allow them to conduct more independent operations and field small amounts of advanced weapons that are tailored to the mission at hand. The Navy could even deploy these more prolifically to help satisfy its evolving vision for ‘distributed lethality’ that includes migrating missile systems to platforms that are not traditionally ‘shooters’ in order to present a far larger threat envelope to the enemy and much greater tactical flexibility. This is especially true when it comes to going after time-sensitive targets that may be out of range of traditional surface combatants or combat aircraft. Under this concept of operations, the sensor and the shooter are increasingly decoupled. In other words, the sensor—or sensors—that detect and target an enemy aircraft, missile, ship, ground vehicle, or structure are attached to platforms that may not actually launch an attack on said target. Instead, the targeting coordinates and telemetry are data-linked from the sensor platform to a platform that has a weapon that can prosecute an attack. What this means is that an F-35 can ask for an SM-6 surface-to-air missile from a ship far away to prosecute a target in their vicinity deep over the battlefield. Or an Aegis-equipped destroyer detects an enemy ship closer to a logistics ship outfitted with an ADL that is carrying Naval Strike Missiles and the destroyer instructs the ship to fire one of its missile at the target. Under such a concept, the vessel carrying missiles doesn’t even have to be equipped with the sensors needed to employ them itself at all. If the missile includes a data-link and the ship is also plugged into the network, other sensors on platforms hundreds of miles away can provide the necessary targeting information and telemetry to the missile. This opens up new possibilities for far greater coverage for everything from land attack to missile defense without having to simply build more multi-billion dollar vessels to increase capacity and coverage area. This concept is especially relevant as modern sensors increasingly outrange the reach of some of the missiles the platform they are attached to carries. For some ships, being able to organically target the missiles in the Adaptive Deck Launcher themselves is also very possible. Take the Littoral Combat Ships for instance, which do pack some capable sensors, including unmanned drones and manned MH-60R helicopters, but currently lack firepower to make the most out of them. ADL could be the highly versatile host for the ‘teeth’ that these ships so clearly lack. In addition, the Tomahawk land attack missile system was designed to work from a modular programming interface that could be installed on any ship. The RIM-162 ESSM in its new Block II format doesn’t need dedicated radar illuminators to engage its target like its predecessor did. Instead, it is networked and can get telemetry from a ships’ air-search radar that is fed to them via data link. In other words, for some ships, the ADL could give them ESSM capability with relatively minor modifications and software upgrades. For the Littoral Combat Ships, in particular, one can imagine how the weapons mix could be varied depending on the mission. For anti-submarine focused work, three ASROC anti-submarine rockets could be carried as well as a quartet of ESSMs for self-defense. For operations in high-threat areas, all four cells could contain ESSMs, with a total loadout of 16 missiles. For mixed operations, eight ESSMs could be carried along with a pair of Naval Strike Missiles or Tactical Tomahawk Missiles. For distributed warfare ops, maybe throwing a single SM-6 into one of the cells for contingencies could be a wise choice, as well. What’s most important is that this is a relatively low-cost option that can take advantage of all the Mark 41 support infrastructure that is so prevalent in the U.S. Navy, as well as the specially-packed weapons that go along with it. With that in mind, it offers a tremendous amount of additional flexibility over bolt-on box launchers that accommodate just one type of weapon and offer no future growth opportunities. Those proprietary box launchers, like the ones used for Harpoon or Naval Strike Missile , also don’t have the ability to integrate ESSM. So, an additional VLS would be needed if any air defense capability was wanted, such as a farm of Mk 56 /48 cells that are dedicated to ESSM alone. These also take up additional deck space and aren’t stealthy by design, something the ADL can be if requested. Mk 48 VLS onboard the Japanese destroyer Ikazuchi ., Yaso Osugi/Wikicommons There are other advantages worth mentioning, as well. Reloading a traditional Mk 41 cell at sea is a major challenge, one that has drawn worry as to how ships will stay replenished of weaponry during a large scale conflict. The ADL loads these canisters sideways, which makes them far easier to handle and requires equipment that may already be available on many ships. Also, it turns out that the latest ESSM Block II’s increased weight has gone beyond what the Mk29 box launchers found on carriers and amphibious assault ships, that were originally designed for the old RIM-7 Sea Sparrow , can handle. So, a new launcher is needed if the Navy wants to bring ESSM Block II capability to these highly prized assets. The ADL was built to satisfy this requirement and bring quad-packed ESSM cells to these ships, as well. Currently, the Mk29s can only hold eight ESSMs. The ADL can hold 16. The system was also designed with the Navy’s future “FFG(X)” frigate in mind. Using this system would free-up space below deck and could be integrated directly into the frigate’s superstructure. It could also offer strike-length cells when tactical-length cells were all that could be accommodated with a traditional Mark 41 system. This wouldn’t only allow it to hold larger missiles, but it would also add more future growth potential when it comes to hosting new weapons. Different ADL configurations, including the low-observable one on the left. , BAE Systems It would be nice if they could offer an option with the strike length cells on top and four more tactical-length cells on the bottom. Maybe each row could share the same flame funnel and thermal handling system too. This would allow for far more weapons carriage capability without taking up any more deck space. But regardless if this is possible or not, the ADL may, at least at first glance, be puzzling to some, but when you drill down you realize just how promising and force-multiplying this concept could actually be. Often times people forget that the clean and near-flush hatches of a traditional Mark 41 VLS hide the massive rectangular cube of launch tubes and the infrastructure that supports them that descends dozens of feet into the bowls of a ship. While they may not take up much space horizontally, they sure do vertically. For ships where such a deep installation cannot be accommodated, or where the cost and level of work needed to make the ship capable of accommodating it is prohibitive, the ADL is a logical choice. The fact that it can be bolted on to just about any ship with enough open deck space to accommodate it, is even more exciting. Now we’ll have to wait and see if the U.S. Navy and any of its allies think so, as well.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 20, 2018",Is The U.S. Navy Missing The Boat By Not Including The Type 26 In Its Frigate Competition?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Navy gets closer to issuing the final request for proposals for its future frigate competition, or FFG(X) , one particularly notable design, BAE System’s Type 26 , has largely been absent from the discussion. It seems particularly curious given that the British-designed ship is well on its way to becoming one of the most popular warships in its class among some of America’s closest allies, with 32 examples in various configurations on order for the U.K. Royal Navy , the Royal Australian Navy , and the Royal Canadian Navy . BAE did propose a variant of the Type 26 to the Navy in 2017 , but the United Kingdom-headquartered defense contractor did not receive one of the five initial developmental contracts in 2018. The service says it still expects other firms to make offers when it announces the formal request for FFG(X) proposals, which is supposed to happen by the end of September 2019. But with an eye toward reducing risk and keeping costs low, the program, at present, is focused on designs based on ships that are already in service. Construction of the very first Type 26 for the Royal Navy only began in 2017 . The Type 26’s design itself, also known as the Global Combat Ship (GCS), dates back to the mid-2000s. BAE Systems originally developed the ship, which The War Zone previously examined in depth , in response to a U.K. Royal Navy requirement, but has always had an eye toward the export market. “BAE Systems has a proven track record in licensing warship designs and combat systems to international customers and partners, enabling local build which enhances skills and improves in-service support,” the company’s website says . “BAE Systems has committed to working with prospective international partners to learn more about their requirements and ensure these can be met by the Global Combat Ship design.” If it weren’t for the “already in service” requirement, just based on the Navy’s other publicly stated demands and from looking at the other FFG(X) contenders , the Type 26 would certainly be a competitive design. BAE says the ship has a maximum speed of 26 knots, or around 30 miles per hour, and a range of over 7,000 nautical miles, which would meet certain FFG(X) threshold performance requirements. It is not clear if this reaches the Navy’s desired top speed, though, although it surely could be modified to do so. An infographic giving a basic overview of the Type 26 for the Royal Navy and its performance and capabilities., BAE Systems A crew of just over 150 can operate the frigate, fulfilling another Navy stipulation. The basic design has a big flight deck and associated hangar that could easily accommodate the MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters and MQ-8C Fire Scout the service expects will fly from its FFG(X)s. A rendering of a Royal Navy Merlin helicopter landing onboard a Type 26 frigate., Crown Copyright With a displacement of around 7,000 tons, the Type 26 is also larger overall than the other known FFG(X) competitors by varying degrees. The existing proposals include a design from Fincantieri Marine Group based on its Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate, and an offering from General Dynamics Bath Iron Works derived from Spanish shipbuilder Navantia’s F100 Álvaro de Bazán -class . Austal USA has pitched a new version of its Independence -class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), while the proposal from Hungtinon Ingalls Industries remains unknown. Lockheed Martin, which had been working on a variant of its Freedom -class LCS, just announced it had decided not to make a bid for the final contract later this year. USN The ship’s starting size could make it easier to accommodate the Navy’s existing weapons and mission systems requirements. For instance, the Royal Navy’s Type 26 design already has 48 vertical launch system cells for the Sea Ceptor surface-to-air missile, as well as another 24 Mk 41 vertical launch system cells, each of which can accommodate a wide array of weapons, including quad-packed RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) or a single Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) cruise missile, among others. FFG(X) calls for a total of 32 Mk 41 cells, which BAE could certainly find space for by deleting the Sea Ceptor system. BAE would still need to accommodate other systems the Navy has outlined in its FFG(X) requirements, including Lockheed Martin’s COMBATSS-21 battle management system, which is a derivative of the Aegis combat system , and Raytheon’s Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR). The service also has significant demands for trade space to support the integration of additional capabilities in the future, including manned-unmanned teaming capabilities and directed energy weapons , among other things. The core Type 26 design already features a reconfigurable “mission bay” that could help with the rapid integration of new systems in the future and make the ship more flexible overall. This, along with the larger starting design, could make a version of the ship particularly attractive. You can read more about the service’s exact requirements for the FFG(X) and its future plans to expand its capabilities here and here . A diagram showing various existing FFG(X) mission system requirements, as well as systems the Navy may want to integrate onto the ships in the future., USN The bigger design may also simply be more expensive. The Navy is targeting an average FFG(X) unit cost of around $800 million . The U.K. Ministry of Defense’s awarded BAE a 3.7 billion pound contract for the first three of its Type 26s, which would average out to more than $1.5 billion per ship, though the deal almost certainly includes other ancillary items and costs that don’t factor directly into the price tag of the individual ships. Still, past estimates have pegged the unit cost for the Royal Navy’s new frigates at between 750 and 800 million pounds . At the time of writing, the current exchange rate is $1.26 to the pound. At the same time, the price the Navy would pay would likely be lower given that the United Kingdom and others have effectively financed the base Type 26’s development already. The service also plans to buy 20 frigates in total, more than twice the number of Type 26s the Royal Navy eventually expects to receive, which could help push the unit cost down, as well. An artist’s conception of one of the future Royal Australian Navy Hunter -class frigates., Australian DOD With all this in mind, and with BAE’s hullform design already mature enough to enter production, one has to wonder whether the Navy is unnecessarily limiting its options by preventing ship designs that are not in service yet from at least competing in the FFG(X) program. In its most recent report to Congress on the frigate project, which came out earlier in May 2019 , the Congressional Research Service raised just this question, writing: As mentioned earlier, using the parent-design approach can reduce design time, design cost, and technical, schedule, and cost risk in building the ship. A clean-sheet design approach, on the other hand, might result in a design that more closely matches the Navy’s desired capabilities for the FFG(X), which might make the design more cost-effective for the Navy over the long run. It might also provide more work for the U.S. ship design and engineering industrial base. Another possible alternative would be to consider frigate designs that have been developed, but for which there are not yet any completed ships. This approach might make possible consideration of designs, such as (to cite just one possible example) the UK’s new Type 26 frigate design, production of which was in its early stages in 2018. Compared to a clean-sheet design approach, using a developed-but-not-yet-built design would offer a reduction in design time and cost, but might not offer as much reduction in technical, schedule, and cost risk in building the ship as would be offered by use of an already-built design. There is a possibility that BAE may already be looking to partner with an American shipyard and to make exactly this case. It is worth remembering that Huntington Ingalls Industries has categorically refused to give any details about its FFG(X) proposal or any information about the team it has working on the ship’s design. This is already curious given that the shipbuilder had been publicly offering more combat-focused frigate variants of its Legend -class National Security Cutter, which it developed for the U.S. Coast Guard, for years now. There has also been speculation that Huntington Ingalls might join with one of the companies competing for the U.K. Royal Navy’s Type 31e General Purpose Frigate tender and pitch a variant of one of those designs to the Navy for FFG(X). Another option might be a design that leverages the Danish Navy’s StanFlex modular mission systems technology. BAE could also look to partner with Lockheed Martin, as the two companies are already working together to supply a Type 26 variant to the Royal Canadian Navy. The American firm has also now dropped out of the FFG(X) competition as a prime contractor, saying it made its decision in large part on the fact that it will be supplying various systems, such as the COMBATSS-21, to whoever wins the final FFG(X) competition. The two would still need to identify a U.S. shipyard to build the American variant of the Type 26. An artist’s conception of the Royal Canadian Navy’s future Type 26 variant., BAE All told, it is hard to deny that the Type 26 offers a more modern design than any of the existing FFG(X) competitors. The fact that three of America’s closest allies are betting big on it is also very attractive, to say the least. Its size and unique feature set lend themselves better to longevity and the ability to offer more flexible capabilities down the road, too. Although the Navy wants something as close to off the shelf as possible, it seems irresponsible to not at least consider what they are giving up by leaving the Type 26 out of the competition.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",B-52s Would Have Nuked Their Way Through Soviet Air Defenses With These Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During the Cold War, it seemed that nuclear warheads were the solution to an alarming number of tactic and strategic challenges. Need to intercept and shoot down formations of nuclear bombers emerging from over the North Pole? Nuclear weapons. Need to sink a naval task force? Nuclear weapons. Need to get your bombers to their targets deep inside enemy territory without being shot down by enemy air defenses? Nuclear weapons, and in this case, Boeing’s AGM-69 Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM), in particular. Much of this was more to do with limitations of precision guidance and fine-tuned targeting capabilities than anything else. A nuclear warhead has effects that can destroy soft and some fortified targets from the shockwave alone. So, acceptable and effective accuracy could be measured in hundreds or even thousands of feet, not tens of feet or even less as is common today. SRAM was born in the early 1960s out of the glaring reality that even with nap-of-the-earth flying, America’s bombers were increasingly vulnerable to the Soviet’s ever more capable air defenses. In fact, the requirement for a nuclear-tipped missile capable of taking out enemy air defense sites that could threaten a strategic bomber on its path to its assigned target was already realized in the form of the AGM-28 Hound Dog missile. B-52 carrying a pair of Hound Dog missiles., USAF This system entered service in 1960, but it was massive—weighing in at over 10,000lbs and measuring 42 feet long—drastically limiting what type of aircraft could employ it and how many an aircraft could carry at a single time. A better solution was needed for the Air Force to continue to claim its bomber arm of the nuclear triad represented a reliable deterrent. Enter the AGM-69A SRAM. Entering service in 1972, it weighed in at around 2,200lbs and measured 14 feet in length. It was minuscule compared to the Hound Dog, allowing for large quantities to be stored inside a bomber’s weapons bay. Its primary mission was the destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD)—to obliterate threatening SAM sites along a bomber’s path—but it was also to be used as a nuclear strike weapon. In this ancillary role, it could vaporize secondary targets as its mothership flew to its primary target set. AGM-69A SRAM., USAF SRAM’s range was roughly 50 miles, but could reach out to nearly 100 miles under certain flight profiles. It achieved this using a dual-pulse rocket motor that made it possible for the missile to hit targets behind the launching aircraft and achieve fly-out speeds of up to Mach 3.5. It also had a basic terrain-following feature to add to its own survivability. Guidance was provided by an onboard inertial navigation unit giving the weapon good enough accuracy—with a circular error probability (CEP) of around 1,400 feet—to deliver its variable yield W69 warhead that could be set from 17kt to 210kt. For comparison, the “Little Boy” nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima had a yield of roughly 15kt. The missile was programmed before a mission with its intended target, but it could be reprogrammed in flight as well. B-52 loaded with SRAMs., USAF Originally intended for the B-52G and B-52H , SRAM went on to equip the FB-111 and the B-1B. The B-52s could carry up to 20 on its external pylons and in its internal bay. The FB-111 could carry six—two internally and four externally. The B-1B could carry two dozen SRAM—eight each on its three internal rotary launchers. Eight SRAMs seen on a rotary launcher., Boeing In reality, a mix of SRAMs and nuclear bombs were to be carried depending on the mission and intended target set. SRAMs would be used by the bombers to blast their way to their primary targets or, later on, to hit strategic targets that were not air defense related at all. This secondary use was especially attractive for vaporizing targets in extremely well-defended airspace. An inert SRAM being loaded onto an FB-111. , USAF SRAM was really an amazing invention and one that had a real purpose—helping to keep non-stealthy bombers viable for decades as Soviet air defenses matured. But, in 1982, the introduction of the AGM-86B nuclear-tipped variant of the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) would allow B-52s—and eventually B-1Bs—to launch nuclear strikes at long standoff ranges, placing them far from threatening air defense sites. Then, with the Cold War winding down towards the end of the decade, the need for SRAM degraded further. In 1990, then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney ordered SRAMs taken off all alert bombers . Concerns regarding the warhead’s ability to withstand fires aboard aircraft had become a serious issue. The W69 warheads were not built to the same standards as later designs and a ground fire on an alert bomber that occurred years earlier could have resulted in a massive release of radiation, potentially on a larger scale than Chernobyl, from the flames compromising the shielding around the warhead’s plutonium core if the winds had been blowing in a different direction. In 1993, the aging stockpile of missiles became an even more pressing concern. Beyond the safety of their warheads, the condition of the SRAM inventory’s rocket motors was called into question. A number of SRAMs were found with cracked propellant sections, likely the result of constant changes in atmospheric temperature over the years. If fired, a cracked motor would likely explode and take the aircraft with it while also scattering nuclear debris and radiation over a huge area. This, along with major reductions in defense spending and America’s nuclear posture, were the final nail in the coffin for SRAM. The weapons were pulled from service in 1993 and destroyed. SRAMs being loaded into the belly of a B-52., USAF In the end, roughly 1,500 SRAMs were built, with production ending in 1975. Over the years, a follow-on AGM-69B SRAM was proposed, including one configuration with an upgraded propulsion section and W80 warhead. Other variants that never made it beyond the drawing board included a SRAM outfitted with an anti-radiation seeker to home in on hostile radar sites without programming a specific location into the weapon prior to launch. This weapon was far more reactionary in nature that the AGM-69A and could have effectively deal with ‘pop-up’ threats, but it never came to be. An air-to-air variant was also examined. A far more robust effort began in the late 1970s to replace SRAM with an upgraded version for the B-1A bomber. When the B-1A was canceled, so was the follow-on SRAM, but once the B-1 was resurrected in B-1B form under the Reagan Administration, development for a new SRAM began again, as well. Dubbed the AGM-131A SRAM II, this weapon was largely a fresh design that featured a new and improved dual-pulse rocket motor. It was also lighter, less complex, and used a purpose-built and more modern W89 nuclear warhead as a payload. W89 warhead and the SRAM II missile body., DOE/USAF The program progressed up until 1991. With the fall of the Soviet Union, justifying such a weapon and its costs just wasn’t possible, especially after a number of costly delays in the weapon’s development. The B-1B would lose its nuclear mission in the same decade, underscoring the logic of the decision to end the SRAM II program. In addition, cruise missiles were becoming the delivery method of choice for nuclear bombers and the level of precision of modern air-to-ground weaponry was rapidly increasing, allowing for conventional warheads to take the place of nuclear ones for many applications. A tactical variant of the SRAM II was also part of the AGM-131 program. This would have equipped F-16s and F-15s that were tasked to deliver tactical nuclear bombs in Europe and the Korean Peninsula. , DoD Fast forward to today and the SRAM concept is being reborn to a certain degree—albeit not in a nuclear fashion—with the development of standoff missiles uniquely designed to quickly blast enemy air defenses as fighters and bombers press toward their targets. The Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) is now a Navy and Air Force program and will serve as the basis for the USAF’s Stand-In Attack Weapon . Both of these missiles will be capable of internal storage on the F-35A and F-35C. You can bet they will also wind up on the B-21 Raider in the coming decade. Above all else, the big takeaway here is that USAF bombers were very much set to fight their way to their primary target sets by blasting air defense sites with nuclear weapons along the way. As such, SRAM was a very ineloquent solution to a very real problem facing America’s airborne strategic deterrent before the introduction of highly capable air-launched cruise missiles. SRAM also serves a reminder of just how much destruction a B-52 of the latter Cold War era would have laid down in its wake. A frightening reality to contemplate indeed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 2, 2020",These Secret Helicopters Were Flown By A Shadowy Unit During The Battle of Mogadishu,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In August 1993, a joint U.S. special operations force, known as Task Force Ranger, with personnel from elite units across the services, deployed to Somalia. Its principal objective was to hunt down and capture warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid and other senior militants responsible for orchestrating attacks on U.S. and U.N. personnel in the country. It is well known that this task force included special operations helicopters from the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , which infamously lost two MH-60 Black Hawks in the aftermath of one raid. This event is now known commonly as the Battle of Mogadishu or the Black Hawk Down incident. But there is also significant evidence that it also received support from two Little Birds from one of the U.S. military’s most top-secret aviation units, the Flight Concepts Division . There are limited pictures and video from Task Force Ranger’s deployment to Somalia, also known as Operation Gothic Serpent, in general. The operation began with the departure of an advance party on Aug. 22, 1993, and lasted until mid-October 1993. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) provided the bulk of the organic aviation support for the force with a mix of MH-60 Black Hawks and AH-6 and MH-6 Little Birds. Task Force Ranger also included a squadron from the Army’s secretive Delta Force and a company from that service’s elite 75th Ranger Regiment . There were also additional personnel from the U.S. Navy’s Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), better known as SEAL Team Six , and the U.S. Air Force’s 24th Special Tactics Squadron . The U.S. Special Operations Command’s Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) oversaw the task force, with U.S. Army Major General William Garrison, JSOC’s commander at the time, going to Somalia himself to lead the operation. But at least two undated images from the operation show another pair of mysterious Little Birds with some small, but distinct differences from those assigned to the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR). Unlike their light attack and light assault cousins, these aircraft appear to have been highly specialized intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance platforms with then state-of-the-art equipment. Covert intelligence gathering platforms The first of the available images, seen at the top of this story and below, shows the two Little Birds at a seaside Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP), along with an OH-58D Kiowa Warrior . The Kiowa Warrior is another important piece of this story, but more on that later. The two Little Birds at a FARP in Somalia, along with an OH-58D Kiowa Warrior in the middle., via ARC Forums The two helicopters both feature a large “ batwing ” satellite communications antenna on top of their tail boom, as well as downward facing “sugar scoop” exhausts. This latter feature helped to reduce the helicopter’s infrared signature, making it less vulnerable to heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles. One of the helicopters has a sensor turret under the nose, similar to the 160ths AH-6s and MH-6s. This could be a Hughes AN/AAQ-16 forward-looking infrared (FLIR) turret, which Raytheon Systems Company continued producing into the 1990s. This system provides infrared full motion day or night video in almost any weather conditions. For years, it was a standard feature on the Army’s special operations AH/MH-6s, MH-60s, and MH-47s , as well as the U.S. Air Force’s HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters, among other aircraft. The other helicopter, however, has a much larger turret on a mount on the right side of the fuselage. This is a WESCAM system , which Canadian firm Isolation Stabilization Technologies, or Istec, produced at the time. The Military Division of Westinghouse Canada originally developed this system for the Canadian military. WESCAM stands for Westinghouse Steered Stabilized Camera Mount. The WESCAM is also a FLIR sensor, but it had greater range and stability compared to the AN/AAQ-16 thanks to a telescopic lens and a more robust gyro-stabilized gimbal. The complete system also featured a data link that could transmit the feed straight back to command centers on the ground. A Bell Model 206L Jet Ranger helicopter equipped with a WESCAM “ball” takes off from Bankstown Airport in Sydney, Australia circa 1998., YSSYguy via Wikimedia The WESCAM “ball” would have allowed this helicopter to orbit much further away from its target, while still providing important persistent surveillance capabilities. This would have been an essential capability for Task Force Ranger’s mission locate and capture specific individuals. Since the 1990s, the technology necessary to provide this kind of persistent surveillance has steadily become smaller even while providing much higher fidelity and greater wide-area surveillance functionality . In 2002, L3 Technologies bought WESCAM, which became L3 WESCAM , and the company continues to produce a particularly popular MX line of sensor turrets for aircraft and other platforms. The helicopter with the ball notably has an additional blade antenna on the right side of the fuselage, as well as one under the forward fuselage. These are often associated with high-frequency radios and other communications systems. Converted commercial Little Birds Beyond their specialized equipment, it is also clear that these helicopters are MD Helicopters Model 500s or 530Fs , types that the 160th does not appear to have ever flown. Based on its features and other available information , the far aircraft in the FARP photo appears to be a 530F in that it features a pointed nose. The Army’s special operations AH/MH-6 variants, which Boeing now produces, have rounded noses. All of these helicopters are derivatives of the Hughes Model 369, which the Army first began flying as the OH-6A Cayuse scout helicopter in 1966. In parallel, Hughes developed the commercial 500 series, which steadily evolved to incorporate more powerful engines and other improvements, including a main rotor with five blades instead of four and a redesigned T-shaped tail. In 1982, what had become Hughes Helicopters first introduced the pointed nose on the Model 500E . In 1984, McDonnell Douglas bought Hughes Helicopters, renaming it MD Helicopters, and that company introduced the 530F variant that same year. The 530F was a version of the 500E optimized for hot-and-high conditions with a new 650-shaft horsepower Allison 250-C30HU engine. An Afghan Air Force MD Helicopters 530F., USAF The WESCAM-equipped Little Bird in Somalia may have a rounded nose found the AH/MH-6 Little Birds, as well as on earlier 500-series helicopters , but it has another set of features that identify it as a commercial helicopter. To this day, 500-series helicopters, as seen in the picture of an Afghan Air Force 530F above, feature trapezoidal fins on either side of the T-shaped tail. The 160th’s AH-6s and MH-6s have arrow-shaped fins. A second picture of the two mysterious helicopters, which appears to have been taken at Mogadishu International Airport, where Task Force Ranger operated from, shows little of the helicopters beyond their distinctly 500-series fins. The trapezoidal fins are clearly visible in this picture., via ARC Forums A pair of AH-6J Little Birds from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment take off in Iraq in 2003. The arrow-shaped fins are clearly visible., USAF Further adding to the evidence that these helicopters were commercial 500-series helicopters is a curious entry in the operations log from the Battle of Mogadishu on Oct. 3-4, 1993. It reads “Recce launch (2 x H-530 & 1 x OH-58D),” according to Leigh Neville’s Day of the Rangers . U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Casper’s memoir also mentions this tasking, with the added note that this was to replace a U.S. Navy P-3 Reef Point intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft that had previously been on station over the city, another type of aircraft we will circle back to later. At the time Casper was head of the 10th Combat Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division . He was in Somalia as the commander of a 3,600-man quick reaction force, known as Falcon Brigade, which was separate from Task Force Ranger and attached to the U.N. force in the country. There is no indication that the available picture showing the pair of 530Fs with an OH-58D is actually from the Battle of Mogadishu, but it does indicate that this was a common combination for reconnaissance and surveillance operations in support of Task Force Ranger. The OH-58Ds were officially part of Falcon Brigade, but had been “chopped” to the special operations force after its arrival in the country. The Kiowa Warrior in the picture has its own batwing satcom antenna, a feature that was not found on standard Army versions of this helicopter, indicating that this was added during the deployment to link it to the task force’s communications and data networks. “Shortly after TF Ranger’s arrival, TF Raven chopped the Fort Hood-based OH-58Ds to TF Ranger,” Casper told U.S. Army Major Marshall Ecklund and U.S. Air Force Major Michael A. McNerney during the course of their work on a 2004 joint master’s thesis at the Naval War College. “The OH-58D’s unique mast-mounted optics and FLIR could be ‘down-linked’ directly to TF Ranger’s JOC [Joint Operations Center].” A US Army OH-58D Kiowa Warrior., US Army Helicopters from a top-secret unit All this evidence strongly points to the two 500-series helicopters belonging to a top-secret U.S. Army unit known at the time as the Flight Concepts Division . The service established this entity, in cooperation with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), around 1981, at which time it was called Seaspray . Seaspray’s job was to provide fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters to support “black” covert and clandestine operations, often working together with the Army’s secretive Delta Force and Intelligence Support Activity (ISA), as well as CIA paramilitary elements . MD 500 and 530 helicopters, along with Beechcraft King Airs, some of which were converted to intelligence gathering platforms, initially formed the core of this secret air component, which conducted operations in Latin America, the Middle East, and elsewhere. In 1987, one of the unit’s Little Birds appeared at Frankfurt Airport in what was then West Germany, which you can read about more here . The helicopter was almost certainly supporting then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s visit that year, which included his famous “ Tear down this wall! ” speech. A Seaspray Little Bird sits at Frankfurt Airport in 1987. FAA records show that this helicopter began life as a military Model 369D, also sometimes referred to as the OH-6D, and it features the arrow-shaped fins typically associated with military little birds., Manfred Faber Scandals and leaks to the media about Seaspray and the ISA, the history of which are very much intertwined, prompted the Army to officially shut down those entities in 1989 . They never truly went away, though, continuing to operate in the black world under new names and behind new top-secret special access program codewords. To this day, they remain closely tied to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and the CIA. By the early 1990s, what the Army had called the ISA had morphed into the blandly-titled Office of Military Support, also known by the codename Centra Spike, and Seaspray had turned into the Flight Concepts Division, which had its own codename, Quasar Talent. You can read more about the Flight Concepts Division in this past War Zone feature on it and other top-secret U.S. military aviation units. In Somalia, well before Task Force Ranger even touched down, the CIA at least had been in the country performing a variety of missions, including gathering signals intelligence and setting up local human intelligence networks. Day of the Rangers notes that, by the time the special operations force went into action, there were an array of intelligence assets in place and available to support Operation Gothic Serpent that also included elements from the Flight Concepts Division and the Office of Military Support. In terms of aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, Task Force Ranger could call upon the 500-series helicopters and the OH-58Ds. There were also Beechcraft King Airs with civilian-style paint schemes equipped for intelligence gathering missions, which also could have been from the Flight Concepts Division or the CIA. There was also at least one RG-8A Condor in Somalia, an ultra-quiet, high-flying powered glider that you can read about in more detail here , which may have belonged to the Agency, according to Day of the Rangers . An RG-8A Condor in US Coast Guard service., RuthAS via Wikimedia At this time, long-endurance drones such as the MQ-1 Predator , had not yet become a ubiquitous feature of American military operations, meaning that fleets of manned aircraft with state-of-the-art sensors remained the primary means of providing the kind of persistent surveillance necessary to locate and monitor specific locales and individuals, such as Aidid. The 530Fs, especially the one with the WESCAM ball, would have been an important tool for observing the so-called “ patterns of life ” of individual targets so that Task Force Ranger could determine the best time and place to launch a mission to capture them. The ability to pipe that feed straight into the task force’s Joint Operations Center would have also allowed for more dynamic planning in near-real time. It’s important to remember that Colonel Casper stated that the pair of 500-series helicopters, along with the OH-58D, were specifically meant to take over for a Navy Reef Point aircraft. Subsequently known by the codename Iron Clad, these “ special projects ” P-3s are not to be confused with the Navy’s EP-3E Aries electronic intelligence aircraft. Their exact configuration is classified, and has changed multiple times over the years, but the aircraft flying over Mogadishu on Oct. 3-4, 1993 had a powerful electro-optical and infrared camera suite that could provide full-motion video, according to Day of the Rangers . The Reef Point/Iron Clad aircraft also carry signals intelligence systems and have an array of communications systems and data links to be able to send video and other information to ground control stations. A P-3 assigned to Patrol Squadron Special Projects Unit One (VPU-1) at the time of that unit’s disestablishment in 2012., USN So, it is possible that second 530F may have carried signals intelligence gear to help in initially locating targets for the camera-equipped Little Bird to focus its attention on. There is limited information available about a small number of “EH-6” Little Birds, which may have been assigned to the 160th or Seaspray in the 1980s. Some reports suggest these aircraft were simply communications relay nodes , rather than electronic intelligence platforms. After Somalia There remain virtually no details about the exact scope of the Flight Concepts Division’s involvement in Somalia in support of Task Force Ranger, or that of other covert aviation elements, and the full extent of those activities may never emerge. We don’t know what happened to the two 530Fs after their tour in Somalia, either. Little Birds have remained closely associated with the Flight Concepts Division since then, though the exact composition of its aircraft fleet remains shrouded in secrecy. Around 2016, it appears that it changed its official name again, too, becoming the Aviation Technology Office. It is still based in a highly secure hangar facility at Felker Army Airfield, which is situated within Fort Eustis in Virginia. The unit is now slated to get a large new hangar and a host of other facilities in the coming years. An annotated satellite image of the Aviation Technology Office’s future home at Felker Army Airfield in Virginia., US Army What is well known is that the raid in Mogadishu on Oct 3, 1993, touched off a running battle through the city that stretched into the next day. Somali militiamen allied with Aidid killed 18 American personnel, shot down two Black Hawks, and captured U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant , a pilot from the 160th. Nearly two weeks later, Aidid’s men released Durant, along with a Nigerian soldier from the U.N. force in the country who they had captured earlier, to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Operation Gothic Serpent ended days later and Task Force Ranger returned to the United States. Other American forces remained in Somalia under the U.N. flag until March 1994 and the international mission came to a close completely the following year. Aidid declared himself president in 1995, but received no international recognition. He died the following year in a shootout with militiamen allied with Osman Ali Atto , a former political ally. Task Force Ranger had actually captured Atto in September 1993, but he was out of custody the next year as part of an abortive peace process. He died of natural causes in Mogadishu in 2013. The Black Hawk Down incident effectively turned Somalia into a no-go zone for the U.S. military for more than a decade. But since 2007, American involvement of the country has been steadily growing. In 2017, the Trump Administration further expanded the scope and scale of U.S. military operations in the country, ostensibly to combat terrorist groups including the Al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab and a regional faction aligned with ISIS. There has been a dramatic uptick in recent years in American air strikes in the country, including targeted strikes, along with reports of more operations in the ground in concert with local partner forces . Maybe, years from now, we’ll learn that elements of the Flight Concepts Division also returned to the region to reprise their intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance role or provide other support for this new era of still highly classified operations in Somalia.

When it comes to the U.S. military, the very idea of what vertical lift is and what type of aircraft fulfills those roles is slated to drastically change in the coming decades.

Whoever wins any of these competitions will be in the driver’s seat when it comes to expanding their proprietary technologies across the Department of Defense and well into the middle part of the 21st Century. Sikorsky, now owned by Lockheed Martin, is in a very interesting position to potentially lead on many fronts in this regard after investing millions in corporate funds into its high-performance X2 helicopter technology over the better part of two decades. Still, the storied Black Hawk manufacturer has some stiff competition, including from its longtime rival Bell, for both the FLRAA and FARA contracts, while other players are also coming to the table with potentially attractive concepts of varying maturity and complexity that are likely to clock in at a wide range of price points . With the stakes so high, The War Zone reached out to Sikorsky, just as we did with Bell , to get their direct take at the highest levels on many questions surrounding their exciting new aircraft, the competitions that lie ahead, and the future of vertical lift in general. A remarkably accomplished group of folks over at Sikorsky fielded our questions, including Tim Malia, Director of Sikorsky Future Vertical Lift—Light. Bill Fell, senior experimental test pilot for Sikorsky’s S-97 and joint multi-role programs, also joined in. And last, but certainly not least, Chris Van Buiten, Vice President, Sikorsky Innovations. Here are those exchanges in full: What makes the S-97, and its X2 Technology that Sikorsky pioneered, different than a normal helicopter? Bill Fell: “ The X2 is different in that the two rotors are used to balance lift required between the upper and lower discs. By limiting the lift that is required on the retreating side of the disc, we eliminate the aerodynamic speed limit of other rotorcraft known as retreating blade stall. This lift distribution results in a lift imbalance on each individual rotor that is overcome by making the rotors extremely rigid. This rigidity has the added benefit of provide enormous control power for combat maneuvering tactics. Producing most of the lift on the advancing half of the disc means the blades are operating at a very low angle of incidence, resulting in less drag and more load factor capability.” Some of the terminologies has changed and the schedule has shifted a bit, but this graphic gives a good overview of the evolution of Sikorsky’s X2 technology. , Sikorsky Is the S-97 RAIDER a technology demonstrator or is Sikorsky looking to push the design directly into production? What informed the design’s unique mix of capabilities? Tim Malia: “ First, I’d like to say that Sikorsky is proud to have been awarded a contract to design a Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft [FARA] prototype. This is the culmination of years of investment in the X2 Technology Demonstrator and the S-97 RAIDER aircraft that have proven the advanced technology and shown its ability to change the future battlefield. The FARA mission is critical to our nation’s defense as our near-peer adversaries continue to improve their capabilities. FARA will plug a critical gap in the Army force structure that requires revolutionary technology and not just incremental improvements to existing platforms. The original X2 Technology Demonstrator was developed to prove the advancing blade concept was going to unlock speed and maneuverability and increase the survivability under battle conditions. The S-97 RAIDER was a step up from the original demonstrator to make more production representative to get full mission envelope testing. While still considered a demonstrator, its utility expands to include several critical attributes of interest to the Army. We continue to fly the S-97 RAIDER to inform the design for FARA, which provides significant risk reduction to the program schedule and technical objectives. We are eager to continue to support the U.S. Army, and we are excited that the Sikorsky FARA X2 will be ready for this critical mission. The term X2 Technology refers to a suite of technologies developed by Sikorsky that enable the X2 aircraft to operate at high speed while improving operational capability, maneuverability, agility, survivability, and lethality at the landing zone.” S-97 RAIDER, Sikorsky Have there been certain technological hurdles that have been especially challenging to get over during the S-97’s development? Tim Malia: “ When we started working on X2 Technology, we were focused on designing for speed, maneuverability, and scalability. The X2 Technology Demonstrator made significant improvements in vibration reduction, weight reduction, and blade technology. The rigid coaxial blades help maintain lift and stability at high speeds. We took many of our lessons learned in the design and flight test of the X2 Technology Demonstrator into RAIDER and the Sikorsky-Boeing SB>1 DEFIANT. The process was a logical technical maturation. The X2 technology demonstrator proved the physics—speed, vibes, and workload. The technology won the Collier award and the demonstrator was put in the Smithsonian. The X2 had a gross weight of 6,000 pounds, RAIDER grows to double the gross weight and adds operational features. DEFIANT grows the gross weight to above 30,000 pounds to demonstrate the long-range, 12-troop transport capability.” Can you give us some approximate performance targets for the S-97 and the SB>1? Bill Fell: “ RAIDER is designed to be a 220-230 knot aircraft in level flight.  We have achieved 202 knots and will soon push the envelope even more. RAIDER has been test flown at weights of ranging from about 9,500 to 11,000 pounds. DEFIANT is a larger aircraft in excess of 25,000 pounds with more payload, speed capability, and range.” SB>1 concept art. , Sikorsky Cost should be a major factor for the Future Vertical Lift tender. How much more expensive will this more complex, fast-flying design be than say one of your UH-60 Black Hawks that continue to roll off the line today? What about the cost to operate it over time? Tim Malia: “ I think the first point to clarify is that our X2-based FARA is not more complex than a BLACK HAWK. In fact, despite having two main rotors, there are one-half the total parts in the S-97 RAIDER rotor head than on a BLACK HAWK. This reduction in complexity and part count saves money from a sustainment perspective with less parts to maintain and spare. To that end, the rigid rotor system no longer has flapping and lead/lag modes which eliminates the dampers that are a routine maintenance element on a BLACK HAWK. I’d also add that the development of X2 Technology and the RAIDER program has been funded entirely by significant investments by Sikorsky, Lockheed Martin, and industry partners.  As we have made those investments, it has been to change the way we do vertical lift—decrease life-cycle costs, eliminate maintenance burdens. We will provide revolutionary aircraft that not only change the way that we fly our missions and reducing the maintenance requirements that traditional rotorcraft have historically provided. We don’t have to make compromises with X2. The other big-picture benefit of X2 will become apparent as the Army looks across their vertical lift inventory. X2 is the only scalable technology on the table for the Army to consider in their diverse missions. The Army today has three very different aircraft types to maintain, support, and grow capability through technology insertions. Tomorrow they could all reside on the X2 platform, scaled to serve the three very different mission sets. As you look at having X2 in both the Attack/Recon and the Utility/Long Range Assault FVL variants, you can start to envision maintenance and flight training commonality across the entire fleet. When the attack replacement occurs, they can be on the common technology platform across the service. This is an enormous opportunity for the Army to reduce future costs of operations. With the fiscal constraints across the Army, this will be a very welcome change.” SB>1 DEFIANT in flight., Sikorsky In regards to maintenance, how will servicing the S-97 or the SB>1 be different than a traditional helicopter with equal capacity? Chris Van Buiten: “ The most significant servicing difference between the Rigid Coaxial design and a traditional helicopter is that the rigid rotor does not have Main Rotor Dampers. Dampers are typically the highest maintenance items on a helicopter and we do not need them. Other than that, the complexity and supportability is similar. On our next generation of aircraft, the big difference will come from the advanced diagnostic and prognostic systems both onboard and off-board that optimize system maintenance to control costs and maximize availability.” SB>1 DEFIANT., Sikorsky How does a pilot fly the S-97? In other words, how does the aircraft operate different from traditional helicopters from a pilot’s perspective? Bill Fell: “ RAIDER can be flown the same as every other rotorcraft when the prop is disengaged via a clutch. The rotor is controlled through both a cyclic and collective. When the prop is engaged the pilot releases the collective around 100-knots as the flight control computer (FCC) programs the collective down with increasing speed. RAIDER is flown like an airplane above 100 knots with speed increased by increasing prop pitch via a beeper switch on the collective. In this mode, RAIDER climbs by pointing the nose up and adding prop or lowering the nose to descend. The collective is still functional in high-speed flight such that the pilot can increase the collective to climb but using the prop tends to be more efficient.” Back in August of 2017, the Raider prototype suffered a hard landing during a test flight. What happened there and what’s the status of the test program now? Tim Malia: “Aircraft 1 did experience the mishap 21 months ago and we very quickly found the issue in the software that arose from a corner case where the aircraft was going in and out of flight and ground modes while doing air/ground taxi maneuvers. The test pilot immediately knew something was not behaving as expected and put the aircraft down quickly. He performed an orderly shutdown of the aircraft and walked away. It is a testament to the overall design of RAIDER. We were so confident in the technology and the fix to the software that we immediately launched the completion of aircraft 2 and resumed flight testing. We continue to exceed expectations in flight test, and we are looking forward to continued flights that will demonstrate the game-changing speed and maneuverability capabilities of this aircraft and X2 Technology.” S-97 is one impressive looking flying machine. , Sikorsky Future Vertical Lift is actually made up by a number of requirement tiers. Do you think there is room for both Sikorsky’s X2 coaxial compound configuration and Bell’s tilt-rotor configuration to satisfy different mission sets? Or do you see it more as a winner takes all proposition with one technology being pursued across all missions requirements? Chris Van Buiten: “ There is room for both if some of the missions do not require the maneuverability, agility, and other attributes that enable terminal area survivability (surviving at the landing zone). If there are long-range “school bus” missions, we are not focused on them. Our focus is to provide game-changing capability that is achieved by integrating familiar technologies in a new way. It is important to our team to design an aircraft that will retain what our customers love about a BLACK HAWK while giving them huge advances in speed, efficiency, maneuverability, and survivability.” What military variants of this compound coaxial helicopter concept do you see as being feasible? How large can it scale up to? Chris Van Buiten: “ We see a wide spectrum of variants including special operations, recon, attack, assault, Naval, SAR, and VIP. The technology scales. The X2 Technology Demonstrator was 6,000 lb gross weight, RAIDER is 12,000, and DEFAINT is 32,000 lb gross weight. We have executed a study contract looking at a 100,000 lb variant of this configuration.” Concept art showing the SB>1 next to a gunship variant, both of which could satisfy the Army’s Future Vertical Lift requirement. , Sikorsky There is a lot of confusion about the Raider’s low-observable (stealth) qualities, or lack thereof. Can you set the record straight when it comes to the design’s radar signature? What about its infrared and acoustic signatures? Tim Malia: “ We can’t comment specifically about any classified elements of the design or operation in the intended environment. We are focused on the future battle and future adversaries and providing the technology that maximizes the survivability of the platform and the crew. This is a crucial mission. It is at the front lines and into enemy territory, and it takes a platform with both the speed and agility as well as onboard systems and sensors to operate in a contested A2AD environment. We are able to leverage the full strength of Lockheed Martin to provide a solution that will change the way we fight and win any future conflicts.” H ave elements of the aborted RAH-66 Comanche program carried over to the S-97 or any other Sikorsky program? Chris Van Buiten: “ While we are not using any specific Comanche parts, some of the technologies and processes from Comanche are being used.” Sikorsky Who do you see being potential customers for the S-97? How will it fit into the U.S. Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft initiative? Can you explain how you see it fitting into that program and will there be major configuration changes to the Raider’s design in order make the S-97 fit better with the program’s goals? Tim Malia: “RAIDER is so closely aligned to the solution needed by the Army. It was originally designed for the AAS (Armed Aerial Scout) program and now with the evolving threat and a shift to a near-peer adversary, it is necessary to increase the size of the platform for FARA to best handle the future missions. This involves scaling the platform up slightly to increase its payload/range/time on station performance that retains an asymmetric advantage over future adversaries. One great advantage to X2 is its scalability from S-97 RAIDER to a FARA configuration, and as evidenced by DEFIANT, up to an aircraft three times larger than RAIDER. With conventional helicopters, it’s questionable if you can scale up slightly in performance marginally to meet FARA desired attributes. If the desired attributes are marginally achieved, we see that as being the end of the road for conventional helicopters, leaving no ability to grow to higher payloads nor higher speeds in the future. Additionally, the handling qualities of the conventional helicopter operating at the far end of the capability curve will hurt the survivability of the platform and crew. X2 provides the growth that will be needed in the future as the threat evolves and the requirements become more difficult. It is important to remember that these aren’t unsubstantiated claims of a paper design, we are proud to have made tremendous private investment to build and fly RAIDER to prove out the technology and the ability to change the future of aviation.” S-97 speeding over Florida wetlands during testing. , Sikorsky How will the S-97 be able to survive on the battlefields of the future? Are there other technologies that Sikorsky is looking to pair with it for synergistic effects? Chris Van Buiten: “ S-97 RAIDER will survive on the modern battlefield by being nearly twice as fast, twice as maneuverable, and nearly half the sound. When you combine these attributes, you see game-changing survivability. We have quantified this difference using man in the loop survivability simulations. Our MATRIX autonomy solution will enable RAIDER to operate safely very close to the ground at speed to enhance survivability with acceptable workload. Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin have a full spectrum of additional technologies to deploy to further enhance the survivability beyond the basic vehicle. An interesting future synergistic effect could be directed energy weapons [DEWs]. An X2 Technology airplane with a DEW and inflight refueling provides a remarkable recon attack capability that does not need to rearm and refuel on the ground. The ability to easily refuel at tanker speeds and altitudes is an enabler here. This is a future game changer.” Is Sikorsky looking at porting the S-97’s X2 technology over to the unmanned space? Bell just unveiled a full-size mockup of their V-247 tilt-rotor combat drone . Could a ‘MQ-97’ compete against it? What about using an unmanned variation of the design the USMC’s new MUX program ? Chris Van Buiten: “ Our FVL solutions will meet emerging customer requirements to flexibly operate with 2 crew, 1 crew, or zero crew, depending on mission needs. This provides tremendous flexibility to the warfighter. The customer calls this capability “Optimally Piloted.” We are flying on our SARA (Sikorsky Autonomy Research Aircraft) demonstrator now and will be flying on BLACK HAWK in the near future. It is interesting to think about a wolfpack of RAIDER aircraft executing missions in which some are manned and many are not. This technology will also significantly improve the safety of future platforms.” RAIDER concept art. , Sikorsky It seems like the S-97 and the SB>1 designs would have many applications outside of Future Vertical Lift or the armed reconnaissance role—or even military uses for that matter—such as search and rescue and even commercial and private applications. Has there been any interest in the designs outside of the Pentagon? Do you see this as a niche capability or will traditional helicopters eventually be viewed as lower-end vertical lift platforms? Chris Van Buiten: “ There is significant international and commercial interest in the technology. It will be interesting to see what fraction of traditional helicopter applications transition to this capability. This will be much more than a niche.” How has Lockheed’s acquisition of Sikorsky impacted the S-97 program? Chris Van Buiten: “ The acquisition has been great for Sikorsky. First of all, the RAIDER program never missed a beat. Lockheed leadership has been supportive of RAIDER 100%. As we proposed an aircraft based on X2 Technology to the Army for the FARA requirements, we are able to bring to bear a wide spectrum of systems and capabilities from across the corporation.” S-97., Sikorsky Can you tell us three things we probably don’t know about the S-97 Raider? Bill Fell: “ 1. Normal rotor RPM is from 85 to 100% as the rpm decreases automatically with speed to reduce rotor drag. 2. When you fly in helicopter mode with the prop disengaged RAIDER is very quiet. 3. If the engine were to quit at 200+ knots the pilot has on the order of 20-30 seconds of level deceleration holding altitude before he has to lower the collective. The FCC automatically reduces the prop power requirement and energy is fed into the system while decelerating to maintain rotor RPM. This gives the pilot a comparative eternity to search for a forced landing area. It’s exciting to achieve these high speeds with X2 Technology. It’s undeniably important for the warfighter to get to the mission fast. And once they get there, X2 Technology provides the critical handling qualities that make the aircraft survivable, lethal, and agile. X2 Technology changes the way we fly and fight—we can get there fast, be more effective while on the scene, and we can get out fast.” A big thanks to all the participants in this Q&A and to Sikorsky’s Melissa Chadwick for working with me to make it happen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Few stories have garnered more requests from our readers for commentary than the recent news that the Navy has decided to very publicly change its reporting rules and procedures for when its personnel observes an unexplained phenomenon like a UFO and a USO . There have been wildly varying takes on this sudden change, but the truth is that it is very hard to know what to make of it considering how absurd it sounds—the Navy now wants to know about unidentified craft that can penetrate airspace over its installations and around its most capable naval vessels with impunity? Shouldn’t that be a default position for a service tasked with defending American interests and controlling vast swathes of area above, below, and on the surface of the Earth? Politico was first to report on the Navy’s new directions for reporting unexplained objects operating in the same environment as its vessels and aircraft. Politico’s Bryan Bender writes: “There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years,” the Navy said in a statement in response to questions from POLITICO. “For safety and security concerns, the Navy and the [U.S. Air Force] takes these reports very seriously and investigates each and every report.” “As part of this effort,” it added, “the Navy is updating and formalizing the process by which reports of any such suspected incursions can be made to the cognizant authorities. A new message to the fleet that will detail the steps for reporting is in draft.” To be clear, the Navy isn’t endorsing the idea that its sailors have encountered alien spacecraft. But it is acknowledging there have been enough strange aerial sightings by credible and highly trained military personnel that they need to be recorded in the official record and studied — rather than dismissed as some kooky phenomena from the realm of science-fiction. The Washington Post did their own follow-up to Politico’s story, stating: Recently, unidentified aircraft have entered military-designated airspace as often as multiple times per month, Joseph Gradisher, spokesman for office of the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, told The Washington Post on Wednesday. Citing safety and security concerns, Gradisher vowed to “investigate each and every report.” He said, “We want to get to the bottom of this. We need to determine who’s doing it, where it’s coming from and what their intent is. We need to try to find ways to prevent it from happening again.” In recent years, from what we can tell, in part by the reporting done by The War Zone itself , is that there is no real way to distinctly classify something like a UFO or USO in such a way that it gets reported and an investigation occurs on an official level within the military. This appears to be true for civilian government institutions, like the FAA , as well. The lack of a structured procedure and classification system, and the nebulous fear of being stigmatized by reporting things like UFOs—something that has long plagued the military and private sectors alike—has repressed the conveyance of information in unquantifiable, but hugely significant ways. This reality has led to much speculation, and rightfully so, that the military knows far more about these strange happenings than they are willing to let on, at least on the surface. Otherwise, why wouldn’t they want to know more about intruders wielding fantastic technology that makes them impervious to existing countermeasures and defenses? Now all this appears to be changing on a grand level, but why? The technology is real The fact is that we actually know that in the last 15 years, under at least some circumstances, the military has wanted certain high-fidelity data related to encounters with what many would call UFOs. The most compelling encounter of our time, at least that we know of, occurred in and around where the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was operating during workups to deployment in 2004. The incident, or really the series of incidents as they occurred over a number of days, have become near legendary in nature as the witnesses involved are highly credible in nature and numerous. In addition, we have official reports detailing the incident that convey a very compelling story, as well as hours of testimony from those who were there—a group of sailors and naval aviators that seems to be emerging more and more out of the shadows with each passing day. This is a very basic, but a well-produced overview of the main ‘Tic Tac’ incident. I highly recommend you read the story linked above and the report embedded in it for a much deeper understanding of the events that occurred over multiple days around the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in 2004: https://youtube.com/watch?v=H6ox_F0auwM When it comes to the so-called “Tic Tac” incident that involved the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group off the Baja Peninsula in 2004, conclusions that are nearly impossible not to draw from it are so reality warping that even the forward-thinking aerospace community doesn’t seem to have even begun coming to terms with them. The main revelation is that technology exists that is capable of performing flying maneuvers that shatter our perceptions of propulsion, flight controls, material science, and even physics. Let me underline this again for you, the Nimitz encounter with the Tic Tac proved that exotic technology that is widely thought of as the domain of science fiction actually exists. It is real . It isn’t the result of altered perception, someone’s lucid dream, a stray weather balloon, or swamp gas. Someone or something has crossed the technological Rubicon and has obtained what some would call the Holy Grail of aerospace engineering. This reality is very hard to process for many. There is always an out for some in the form of claiming an odd impromptu conspiracy or some hollow explanation that doesn’t pass muster beyond the first paragraph, but in the end, it happened. As uncomfortable as that fact is, it’s reality. So, we need to use this event as a lodestar going forward when it comes to evaluating and contemplating what is possible and where truth actually lies. Here are video interviews of some of those who were there. Some are quite informal, but they give a good idea of what individuals’ unique perceptions were of the events in question: What many may not know about this event is that it occurred in a place and time where the most powerful set of aerial surveillance sensors ever created were amassed together and were watching and recording it all. And it is the recording part that is maybe the most interesting facet of the Nimitz encounters that has largely been passed over in terms of significance and notoriety. Ideal test conditions What most don’t realize is that the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group wasn’t just equipped with some of the most advanced sensors the world had to offer, but that it also had hands-down the most advanced networking and computer processing capability of any such system. Dubbed Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), this integrated air defense system architecture was just being fielded on a Strike Group level for the first time aboard Nimitz and the rest of its flotilla. Our readers are familiar with CEC and the follow-on iterations that have come since, as we talk about the concepts behind them often. At its very basic level, it uses the Strike Group’s diverse and powerful surveillance sensors, including the SPY-1 radars on Aegis Combat System -equipped cruisers and destroyers, as well as the E-2C Hawkeye’s radar picture from on high, and fuses that information into a common ‘picture’ via data-links and advanced computer processing. This, in turn, provides very high fidelity ‘tracks’ of targets thanks to telemetry from various sensors operating at different bands and looking at the same target from different aspects and at different ranges. Whereas a stealthy aircraft or one employing electronic warfare may start to disappear on a cruiser’s radar as it is viewing the aircraft from the surface of the Earth and from one angle, it may still be very solid on the E-2 Hawkeye’s radar that is orbiting at 25,000 feet and a hundred miles away from the cruiser. With CEC, the target will remain steady on both platform’s CEC enabled screens as they are seeing fused data from both sources and likely many others as well. We are talking about a quantum leap in capability and fidelity here folks. The data-link connectivity and the quality of the enhanced telemetry means that weapons platforms, such as ships and aircraft, could also fire on targets without needing to use their own sensor data. For instance, a cruiser could fire a missile at a low-flying aircraft that is being tracked by a Hawkeye and an F/A-18 even though it doesn’t show up on their own scopes. This capability continues to evolve and mature today and will be the linchpin of any peer-state naval battle of the future that the U.S. is involved with. But back in 2004, it was new and untested on the scale presented by the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group as it churned through the warning areas off the Baja Coast. The key takeaway here is that if ever there was an opportune time to capture the very best real-world sensor data on a high-performance target in near lab-like controlled settings offered by the restricted airspace off the Baja Coast, this was it. And by intention or chance, this is exactly what happened. Someone within the DoD was very interested By multiple accounts from vetted first-hand sources, the hard drives that record CEC data from the E-2C Hawkeye and Aegis-equipped ships were seized in a very mysterious fashion following the Tic Tac incident. Uniformed U.S. Air Force officers showed up on these vessels and confiscated the devices and they were never to be seen again. This is not rumor or hearsay, this is attested to by multiple uniformed witnesses that were on the vessels that made up the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group at the time. At the same time, on an official level, the Navy seemed to shut down any further investigation into the incident. The aforementioned after-action report states that the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group’s senior intelligence officer, whose name is redacted, alerted the Navy’s 3rd Fleet intelligence officer, or N2, about the incident via secure Email. That same Email, known as a Mission Report (MISREP), included the video footage and other details. For unexplained reasons, officials at the 3rd Fleet N2 declined to send this report up the chain of command. They also deleted the MISREP, but speculated that paper copy should have been available. However, there is no indication that anyone went looking for this physical copy of the MISREP during the investigation. Nimitz Carrier Strike Group., USN When interviewed, the Nimitz Strike Group’s senior intelligence officer also offered up the opinion that “he believed it [the UFO] was part of a counterdrug operation based on the area of operations,” which seems wholly incongruous with the available information. As such, even though there is no official indication that an investigation into the events that week ever occurred at a very high level beyond after-action reports, we know someone within the military had a very high interest in what went on and wanted the high-fidelity radar data collected from the Strike Group. Not just deleted, but seized, potentially for exploitation. So yeah, someone was highly interested in this event within the DoD. Whether that was because it was of an unexplained nature or part of a test of a very capable secret aerospace program, remains unclear. Could it be ours? The latter possibility is also very hard for people to come to terms with—that this capability could belong to the U.S. military. There is no better place to test such a system than against the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group with its CEC abilities during its workup off the Baja Coast. It is not an operational environment. Aircraft are not armed and nobody is expecting a fight. It is high-level integrated training with crews that have sharpened skills as they prepare for a cruise in which they could very well be called upon to fight for their country. Those warning areas and range complexes that extend out and down from the Channel Islands off the SoCal coast are among the best space the U.S. military has for training and testing advanced hardware and tactics in a secure and sanitized environment. In other words, it was an ideal testing environment that featured the very best aerial, surface, and undersea surveillance sensors and sensor crews on the planet. The expansive range complexes and warning areas off Southern California and Mexico., FAS.ORG In addition, the fact is that the U.S. government has poured the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars each year into the black budget for the better part of a century. The idea that somewhere along the way they got lucky and made major breakthroughs in highly exotic technologies may not be convenient to believe as a possibility for those that have grander visions for the unexplained, but I contend that it is quite plausible. In fact, it mirrors the cryptic statements made by top players in the dark areas of aerospace development, such as those of the late Ben Rich, a Lockheed’s Skunk Works chief that is largely credited for giving birth to stealth technology as we know it today. For instance, Rich told Popular Mechanics the following that underscores just how long major breakthroughs in man-made clandestine aerospace technology can stay hidden: “There are some new programs, and there are certain things, some of them 20 or 30 years old, that are still breakthroughs and appropriate to keep quiet about [because] other people don’t have them yet.” Clearly, the ability to defy the limits of traditional propulsion and lift-borne flight would be the pinnacle of aerospace and electrical engineering and could be far too sensitive to disclose, at least in some people’s eyes within the national security establishment. Even the risk of testing this technology against known air defense capabilities would have to be weighed against the need for the tightest of secrecy. But since UFOs carry such a stigma and have deep pop culture roots in our society, the risk of doing so against an unknowing Carrier Strike Group operating under tight training restrictions seems small and the setting uniquely ideal. In other words, could the Tic Tac have been ours? Yes. The same could be said of our adversaries. They too could have made some breakthroughs in highly exotic propulsion technology, but I find this less likely due to their more limited resources. But it is still possible. Yet at the same time, we know that whoever that craft belonged to, the information the flotilla collected on it was of great importance to some entity within the DoD. And the fact that just the radar data was seized makes sense in that the extent of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group radar network could not be replicated over land during small-scale testing, or via a chance encounters with military aircraft. Electro-optical data could. The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group represented literally the sum of many parts spread out over a large area and made up of tens of billions of dollars in assets operating with the best technology available at the time. With all this in mind, the idea that the Navy is supposedly just now interested in what its aviators and sailors see when it comes to unexplained craft peculiar and nebulous, to say the least. One can’t help but feel there are two realities at play within America’s defense apparatus—one that sits on or very near the surface and one that resides deep below it. Information warfare If the DoD truly has no idea of what these things are, then it seems absurd that it is just now curious about them after the better part of a century of sightings and even major encounters, including many having to do with its own installations and personnel. In fact, we know that isn’t historically the case and that there has been varying degrees of documented interest in the topic over the years, including funded studies as recently as the last decade in the form of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program —better known as AATIP—and who knows what else we don’t know about. But even AATIP, like the statements we are getting from the Navy today, could have been something designed to emerge into the public domain. One could posit the peculiar assembly of To The Stars Academy , a hybrid entertainment and UFO research corporation assembled by ex-Blink 182 frontman Tom DeLonge that has oddly attracted a number of impressive team members from the defense, aerospace, and intelligence community, is also a government-manufactured—or at least encouraged—information conduit of sorts, at least to some degree. Nearly all of the individuals on its impressive roster are fresh off long careers working, in one way or another, for the government and holding very high-security clearances to do so. This includes Luis Elizondo, the same guy who supposedly ran AATIP for the Defense Intelligence Agency up until its shuttering in 2012. Watch DeLonge on Joe Rogan for an idea of just how questionable this whole arrangement sounds: This, folks, is where the rabbit hole of information and disinformation opens up below us. There is no way around it. With the vacuum of verifiable information that the government has created on the matter, and all the rumor and speculation, one’s truth compass begins to spin with reckless abandon as you dig into these issues. It is not only about what is real and what is not real, but it is also about what does the government want us to believe and not to believe. The truth could be the eventual goal, but getting there may include a long trail of often stale factoid crumbs that seem to lead in puzzling directions. In other words, even if the government wants the truth to come out eventually, it seems alarmingly clear they are going to do it on their own terms, and the timeline for that plan could be measured in decades, not years, or more. On the other hand, putting a possible goal of disclosure aside, there is also a very real reason why the Pentagon would want the idea of UFOs injected back into the public’s consciousness and even to add validity to it. Doing so is in itself a very old chapter in Uncle Sam’s information warfare playbook. During the Cold War, the government actively lied about UFOs and perpetuated UFO hysteria to cover up its secret aircraft programs. They literally spread disinformation to the public in order to create a wonderfully convenient cover for the myriad clandestine weapon systems in development or operational at the time. Now, we are once again back in an age of “great power competition,” according to the Pentagon, and billions of dollars are being pumped into new technologies that were considered exotic themselves just years ago. With this in mind, reanimating maybe the best and most broadly self-perpetuating cover story of all time for sightings of clandestine aircraft that people see in the sky seems like a highly logical and proven act. As I have said over and over again, the sky, and the things we are accustomed to seeing inhabiting it, is going to look increasingly different in the very near term. Hypersonics , drone swarms , directed energy weapons , and a full-on emerging arms race in space are just some of the very real activities and technologies that will dominate the near future of American weapons development. The products of all of these initiatives, once manifested, could appear positively alien to curious bystanders. The military will be able to explain some of this, but some of it they won’t. So, reinvigorating the presence of UFOs in the American psyche by adding heaps of validity to the topic on an official level and possibly also on a less than official level (To The Stars Academy for instance) can help keep secret programs that grace the skies just that, secret. And who knows, that list of programs and technologies could include the very Tic Tac and other bizarrely shaped craft that can defy imagination with their aerial feats that have been spotted and even recorded in recent years. In fact, if the U.S. military has such a capability, the UFO cover story would be imperative to keeping the nature of its existence under wraps. The game has changed If the Pentagon really doesn’t know what these things are or where they come from, after so many years of sightings and odd encounters and its own studies and shadowy probes, then that would be an unfathomable dereliction of duty considering they are, you know, tasked with keeping America safe from the foreign harm. But really, how can we believe the idea that the military has zero opinion on the matter. It seems like a laughable proposition at best. If there is anything they would have high interest in, it would be craft capable of decimating the enemy on a whim. With all that being said, what does the Navy’s move to change its procedures and rules in regards to reporting UFOs mean? Nothing, at least not definitively. Is it a case of one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing? Is it just a relevant move in this new era of heightened power competition with peer state adversaries? Or is somehow part of a broader information campaign with unidentified goals? We can’t say for sure, but a mix of all of those things and more is certainly possible. The reality is the entire narrative, and at times the lack thereof, on UFOs from the Department of Defense, is a total mess of contradictory statements and historical facts. Whatever the truth is, the landscape when it comes to the U.S. government and its relation to unexplained objects in the sky and in our oceans is clearly changing. To what end remains just as much a mystery as the fantastic vehicles themselves.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 2, 2019","These Are The Briefings President-Elect Trump Got On The F-35, Air Force One, and Nukes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just shy of a month before his inauguration in 2017, then-President-Elect Donald Trump held a series of meetings with senior officials from the U.S. Air Force and other branches of the U.S. military, as well as executives from Lockheed Martin and Boeing , at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. At the time, reports said that the primary topics of discussion were the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the Air Force One replacement effort, programs Trump criticized the cost of before and after the meetings , but which he began to soften on in the months afterward. Now, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, we have more details about exactly what information Trump received from the military briefers, including that he received a presentation on the U.S. Nuclear Triad , as well. On Dec. 21, 2016, Trump met with multiple flag officers from the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy. The War Zone obtained a total of three unclassified briefings and one set of unclassified talking points through FOIA. U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan , then head of the F-35 Joint Program Office, briefed the President-Elect on the stealthy fighter jet and U.S. Air Force General Carlton Everhart, chief of Air Mobility Command, provided an overview of the Air Force One recapitalization program. U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jack Weinstein , Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, and U.S. Navy Vice Admiral David Johnson , the principal military deputy for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Research, Development and Acquisition, jointly briefed Trump on the Nuclear Triad. U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Stephen Wilson prepared talking points for the meeting. Bogdan, Everhart, Johnson, and Weinstein have all since retired. “America’s Air Force … Always There … Greatest on the planet,” one of Wilson’s talking points reads. This looks very much like an appeal to Trump’s heavy focus on American “ greatness ” on the campaign trail, including his signature slogan, “Make America Great Again.” “Without Air & Space power … You Lose,” another one declares with the second part bolded for emphasis, again seeming to speak to the president-elect’s campaign trail promises to reinvigorate America’s military capabilities and readiness. “Our job is to win decisively … dominate & crush the enemy … not 51-48 but 100-0.” U.S. Air Force General Carlton Everhart, at left, talks with U.S. Navy Admiral William Moran ahead of the meetings at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 21, 2016. Marine is presently Vice Chief of Naval Operations and is now in line to become his service’s top officer., AP Wilson’s talking points, which you can see below in their entirety, contain a number of other relatively common refrains from the U.S. military at the time, many of which continue to be general talking points to this day. “The technology and capability gaps are closing dangerously fast & we’re not interested in a fair fight,” one says.  “Today’s Air Force is the smallest, oldest, & least ready it has ever been and is out of balance with our national security needs.” The talking points otherwise include a fair amount of mundane details and end with a plea for stable defense budgets going forward, something the U.S. military as a whole had been calling for after years of short-term spending bills from Congress, also known as Continuing Resolutions. It also implores Trump to “Let us run with … BRAC [ Base Realignment and Closure ], anti-regulation, force structure, [and] acquisition reform.” The Trump Administration, with help from a Republican-controlled Congress, would succeed in passing the first full defense budget in a decade, covering the 2019 Fiscal Year , in September 2018. There were also reports that he initially delegated a significant amount of decision making authority to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Trump forced Mattis out in December 2018 after the two men disagreed over the President’s desire to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria. U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Stephen Wilson’s talking points for the meeting with Then-President-Elect Trump., USAF via FOIA Wilson undoubtedly wanted to give his compatriots the best possible start to what had the potential to be a contentious meeting. The F-35 Trump had slammed the F-35 program multiple times on the campaign trail, decrying it as a waste of money and just “ not a very good ” airplane. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” Trump Tweeted out on Dec. 12, 2016, a little over a week before his meetings at Mar-a-Lago. “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.” To his credit, Lieutenant General Bogdan’s presentation is one of the most candid official assessments of the F-35 program to ever become public. The briefing starts out with two slides highlighting well-established talking points about the F-35’s feature set, especially its electronic warfare and sensor fusion capabilities , and a note about the array of allies involved in the program. “Critical to U.S. and allied air dominance for the next 50 years,” a line at the bottom of the first slide reads. “Big, complicated program with significant allied participation,” a similar chyron notes at the bottom of the second. The slide covering F-35 capabilities. It’s interesting to note that the Air Force redacted two items because they are still “pre-decisional.”, USAF via FOIA The slide about the different F-35 variants and allied participation., USAF via FOIA But the third slide, covering the program’s history, efficiently uses space to catalog a host of serious missteps and mistakes in its execution up to that point. It mentions the delay over the F-35B weight issues, the solution to which may have subsequently caused additional problems , and that the decision to begin serial production in 2007 was premature. The entry for 2009 shows that basically everything that could go wrong for the program, did go wrong. Bodgan’s briefing goes even further to say that government intervention in 2011, which led to an effective rebooting of the program with a new schedule and cost estimates, offered a “marked improvement, but not perfect.” The bottom of this slide says, without caveat “Difficult to overcome a troubled past, but program is improving.” A pretty devastating overview of the F-35’s history., USAF via FOIA The program history slide included a box redacted for being “pre-decisional,” suggesting that there are still more granular parts of the F-35 program schedule that are subject to change. These kinds of redactions continue onto the final slide, which covers costs. The unit price estimates for the F-35A for production lots 10 through 13 are redacted, even though Lockheed Martin has released its own data and cost estimates for production well beyond the timeframe in the chart in Bogdan’s 2016 briefing. The final slide in the F-35 briefing Trump received. , USAF via FOIA If Trump’s Tweeting is anything to judge by, the F-35 briefing fell flat, or may have even confirmed his presuppositions. On Dec. 22, 2016, the day after, he Tweeted out “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet !” This attitude, of course, didn’t last forever. It seems in hindsight like it may have been an attempt at a ruse to try to put pressure on Lockheed Martin to offer a better price. “We’re just beginning – it’s a dance,” Trump had told reporters outside Mar-a-Lago after the meetings on Dec. 21, 2016 . “It’s a little bit of a dance. But we’re going to get the costs down and we’re going to get it done beautifully.” Both Lockheed Martin and the Air Force did work hard to drive down the unit prices and Trump’s attitude toward the F-35 has changed dramatically, to put it mildly . There are still very serious concerns about how much it will cost to actually sustain the F-35s in the decades to come, but the President has clearly become enamored with the Joint Strike Fighters, which he often touts as literally “ invisible .” Air Force One Prior to the meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Trump had publicly complained about the cost of buying new Air Force One’s. On Dec. 6, 2016 , he had publicly called for canceling the program entirely over its $4 billion price tag. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” he Tweeted. “Cancel order!” That was the environment General Everhart was walking into to make his own briefing about the Air Force One replacement program. The officer got straight to the point of how critical it is to have these presidential planes and why they invariably cost so much. The very first two slides focus entirely on how President George W. Bush rode on one of the existing VC-25A planes in the immediate wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA The Air Force included Everharts talking points for this briefing in the FOIA release, though the bulk of them are redacted. It does note that he stressed when talking about the specific features of the future 747-8i-based VC-25B aircraft that one engine out on a four-engine plane meant “land as soon as practical,” while one engine out on a two-engine plane meant  “land as soon as possible.” Trump had regularly used his own personal twin-engine Boeing 757, nicknamed Trump Force One , on the campaign trail. A slide covering Air Force One’s features, including the reasoning for picking a four-engine versus a two-engine platform. Descriptions of a number of features are redacted, including those for a component of the future aircraft’s defensive suite , two of the plane’s specialized internal compartments , and some portion of the engines., USAF via FOIA The slide on the program’s cost estimates, which remain the subject of significant controversy , is redacted entirely, though many of the talking points remain. Curiously, the Air Force appeared to argue that what it was doing at the time was in line with the acquisition of the two VC-25A aircraft in the 1980s and the sustainment and upgrading of those aircraft afterward. The VC-25As, “including costs associated with major upgrades performed after delivery,” would have cost $3.7 billion in Fiscal Year 2017 dollars, according to the briefing. But if this was the case, this was a nonsensical argument, since the Air Force said at the time, and has said ever since , that the cost of buying and modifying the two new VC-25Bs will total around $4 billion up front , not including any subsequent updates after delivery. In March 2019 , it revealed that the entire program, inclusive of a variety of infrastructure upgrades and other ancillary purchases, would cost more than $5 billion. The redacted cost estimate slide and associated talking points., USAF via FOIA Everhart capped off the briefing with a slide highlighting the increasing age and difficulting in sustaining the existing VC-25As, necessitating a replacement. The general specifically highlighted difficulties in acquiring spare parts for the 747-200-based presidential aircraft, including an unusual note that the Air Force apparently tries to source these items anonymously in at least some cases. The most likely reason for that would be to keep the supply chain secure from hostile actors, but this would certainly add to the complexities in obtaining replacement components. More specific descriptions on the reasons for “increasing duration and cost of heavy maintenance,” are entirely redacted. USAF via FOIA Unlike with the F-35, Trump did not issue a Tweet directly aimed the Air Force One replacement program after the briefing. It subsequently emerged that Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg reportedly proffered up four cost-reduction options to Trump in his own meeting with the President-Elect later on Dec. 21, 2016. The White House subsequently said that Trump had rejected all of these proposals, but had negotiated his own deal that shaved $1 billion off the final price point. As The War Zone noted at the time , it was unclear how or even if these savings had occurred. The latest cost information for Air Force One replacement program has only further called into question whether there have been any cuts to the program’s costs. America’s nuclear arsenal Previously unreported, Trump also received a very rudimentary briefing on America’s nuclear arsenal at Mar-a-Lago as part of the meetings on Dec. 21, 2016. The President-Elect had already caused a stir when he appeared to have no knowledge about the Nuclear Triad during a debate with rival Hillary Clinton during the campaign in 2015. Lieutenant General Weinstein and U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Johnson provided an overview of the basics of the Triad in their briefing, which includes silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles , nuclear-capable bombers , and ballistic missile submarines . It also focuses heavily on arguments for modernizing the nuclear arsenal, an effort that had begun in earnest under President Barack Obama . The briefing provided general details on the four key strategic weapons programs the U.S. military was pursuing at the time, the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) ICBM, the B-21 Raider stealth bomber , the Long Range Stand-Off (LRSO) air-launched cruise missile, and the Columbia -class ballistic missile submarine, all of which are still ongoing. You can see the slides, such as they were provided via FOIA, below: USAF/USN via FOIA USAF/USN via FOIA USAF/USN via FOIA USAF/USN via FOIA USAF/USN via FOIA USAF/USN This last slide, which is a backup that Trump may not have actually seen, is interesting in that it indicates that the Air Force, at this time, intended to continue operating the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber alongside the B-21 and the B-52H. In February 2018, the Air Force revealed a new plan to outright replace B-2s, as well as the B-1s, entirely as the B-21 enters service, while retaining the B-52Hs. This existence of this briefing explains why Trump took to Twitter on Dec. 22, 2016, to talk about modernizing America’s nuclear stockpile, which at the time seemed otherwise unprompted . “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,” he posted on his preferred social media platform. A lot has changed since December 2016 in regards to all three of these topics, as well as Trump’s attitudes toward them. But being able to put Trump’s nuclear Tweet in context with an actual briefing underscores how the President’s Tweets are often linked directly to closed-door meetings he is receiving from senior officials. These briefings also add valuable new context to the events and important details that are still relevant more than two years later, especially with regards to the capabilities and unit prices of the three F-35 variants and the exact cost of the Air Force One replacement program. Though Trump remained pugnacious on the matters of the F-35 and Air Force One immediately after the meetings at Mar-a-Lago, they appear to have served as a watershed moment in his opinions of both efforts, or the beginnings of a more active U.S. military effort, with the help of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, to craft arguments more likely to change his mind. In February 2017 , Trump claimed he had shaved $1 billion from the cost of the Air Force One program. By May 2017 , the President was boasting that he had personally “straightened out” the F-35 program. In both cases, he had also adopted a much more favorable tone toward those programs. In addition, the briefings offer a window into how the U.S. military talks to Trump, or at least did so initially. Stories over the years have highlighted the President’s apparent preference for shorter briefings with “ killer graphics ” – a direct quote from then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Mike Pompeo, who has since become Secretary of State. The December 2016 meetings in Mar-a-Lago themselves followed a flurry of reports that the President-Elect was only taking one intelligence briefing a week , far fewer than any of his predecessors during the transition period. Trump responded to that news by saying he didn’t need daily updates because he was a “ smart person .” All told, being able to see these briefings, even in their redacted form, provide a significant new perspective on the information Trump was getting, and how he might have been digesting it, during a very important time in history.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 28, 2019",Updating America’s Land-Based Ballistic Missile ‘Nuclear Sponge’ Is A $100B+ Waste,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We hear a lot about “tough decisions” from Pentagon officials when it comes to procurement, even in a time of a significant defense spending boom, to the point that many of those statements seem eye-roll worthy and completely out of touch with just how much the U.S. spends on its massive national security apparatus. One of the biggest ticket initiatives currently on the Pentagon’s books is the revitalization of America’s nuclear deterrent, and for good reason. Selective modernization is needed, but instead of finding an efficient strategic balance that better suits the age in which we live, the Pentagon has gone with a ‘ kitchen sink approach,’ which is wasteful, and above all else, a massive handout to defense contractors . Spurred by a Nuclear Posture Review that cut nothing and recommended adding more, the DoD had predicted spending $325B on nuclear modernization just through 2026. Now that figure looks like it has the potential to climb dramatically with a number of related programs at risk of ballooning in cost and other programs likely to be added in the not so distant future. The reality is that procuring this arsenal is just the cover charge. Maintaining all its different elements for decades to come will put extreme strain on the Pentagon’s budget. With skyrocketing national deficits and the possibility of an economic downturn around the corner, none of this is sustainable. Something has to give. And that something should be the Air Force’s ground-based intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal. Replacing America’s 678 Minuteman III ICBMs—400 of which are operationally deployed at any given time— with a new missile is slated to cost roughly $100B, and that is with reusing and upgrading the existing Minuteman III infrastructure, such as their silos that pockmark the central United States. Now that price looks like it will be rising further, but according to General Timothy Ray there is nothing to worry about because competition will bring the price back down and the more reliable and less maintenance intensive missiles will save money down the line—at least that’s the theory, one that sounds concerningly familiar. Defense News quoted Ray as stating: “Our estimates are in the billions of savings over the lifespan of the weapon, based on the insights… Between the acquisition and the deal that we have from a competitive environment, from our ability to drive sustainment, the value proposition that I’m looking at is a two-thirds reduction in the number of times we have to go and open the site. There’s a two-thirds reduction in the number of times we have to go and put convoys on the road.” Regardless, we are talking about an absolutely massive sum of money here that will lock America into maintaining its ground-based ICBM force for many decades to come. And maintaining it comes at an even higher cost, regardless of what efficiencies may or may not pan out via an updated missile system. To put it into perspective, the estimate for the entire B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber program or the Columbia class nuclear ballistic missile submarine program—including deep investments in research and development in both cases—cost roughly similar sums of money. W78 warhead used on the Minuteman III., USAF A strong nuclear deterrent is absolutely necessary. It is the linchpin that has kept mankind from ending the world for the better part of a century even though two hostile countries have had the ability to do so in a matter of minutes. But there is deterrence and then there is an archaic and downright wasteful strategy that may cause more harm than good. 400 Minuteman III ICBMs are scattered in fixed silos across Montana, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, and North Dakota. Their job isn’t necessarily to be launched during a nuclear attack, it is to suck up enemy warheads that could potentially be used on other targets and require the enemy—Russia—to invest heavily into the ability to neuter America’s ICBM force. In fact, because of the hardened bunkers they are deployed in, multiple enemy warheads would be dedicated to each silo to ensure their destruction. Hence the ICBM force’s nickname—America’s “nuclear sponge.” In order to serve this purpose, a number of ICBMs must be ready to be launched at all times, or they wouldn’t require the attention from the enemy needed to make a strategic impact. Given their fixed positions, they are not survivable in a peer-state nuclear exchange. Once again, that’s their purpose. To soak up thermonuclear warheads en masse. In fact, even though they could potentially be launched before an incoming attack arrived, doing so is not set in stone. If it were, the enemy wouldn’t target them in their opening barrage. Does this sound like madness? Because it is. Minuteman III in its silo., USAF This strategy seems suicidal in that it means that the enemy is going to unleash hundreds upon hundreds of thermonuclear warheads on the central U.S., causing absolute devastation and extreme radiological fallout that will sweep across the country industrial belt and bread basket. In fact, the ICBM force’s very existence, and the threat they pose, invites a massive attack on the continental United States during a nuclear exchange, one that would devastate the country and would cause unthinkable environmental impacts across the globe. With this in mind, the idea of detouring warheads away from some population centers is laughable. There are more left for those targets and the country, and even the entire globe, would struggle to survive after such a devastating nuclear onslaught. The notion that the fixed-base ICBM force imposes large costs on the enemy because they would have to destroy each site is also dubious, as well, as it just spurs the enemy into maintaining a larger nuclear arsenal. And yes, this costs money, but so does having to invest in countering a larger nuclear bomber force equipped with advanced long-range cruise missiles and especially an expanded ballistic missile submarine fleet. Also, attempting to do so doesn’t require the fielding of more strategic nuclear weapons that are intended to pound a massive portion of America into radioactive oblivion. Simply put, the ICBM force’s deterrent value is highly questionable at best. In fact, today Minuteman III missiles on alert aren’t even targeted at Russia or any foe for that matter. Instead, they sit at the ready under a concept called ‘ open ocean targeting ‘ in which they are aimed at the middle of the ocean out of fear of an accidental launch that could start a nuclear war. Still, this doesn’t mean even a launch alone couldn’t start a nuclear exchange, especially during a time of heightened tensions. Inside the launch control bunker of a Minuteman III missile. , USAF It’s unclear how long the retargeting process takes place, but this policy is another indication that these weapons primarily exist to be destroyed. America’s submarine-launched ballistic missiles also sit programmed to hit the ocean, but since they are deployed on a survivable platform, this policy has little impact on their ability to carry out successful nuclear strikes. Even with ‘de-targeting’ measures in place, considering the National Command Authority could have very little time to actually issue a mass ICBM launch, the force also invites the risk of making a world-ending mistake. And it’s not like the U.S. hasn’t come close to barraging Russia with nuclear warheads based on things like technical glitches before, and today we live in an era where cyber warfare is a stark reality. Tom Collina, who also proposed eliminating the ground-based leg of nuclear triad in a piece for Defense One , wrote the following: The United States can safely phase out the existing ICBMs without replacing them. This would save a boatload of money and take the missile states out of the crosshairs. And, as former Defense Secretary Bill Perry has written , it would also address the concern that ICBMs “could trigger an accidental nuclear war.” Last year, before he became defense secretary, Mattis asked if it was time to remove the land-based missiles, as “This would reduce the false alarm danger.” What are Perry and Mattis talking about? Nothing less than a nuclear nightmare, in which atomic weapons are used by mistake. U.S. land-based missiles are highly vulnerable. They sit out in the open and everyone, including Vladimir Putin, knows exactly where they are. So if Russia attacks them (no other country could), President Trump has only two options: launch the missiles before the attack arrives (and destroy Russia), or wait and let them be destroyed in the ground. Either way, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming are toast. But here is the rub: President Trump would have about 10 minutes to make this fate-of-the-world decision. And the only sane decision is not to launch. Why? Because there is no way to know for sure (and you want to be sure) that the feared Russian attack is real. There have been at least three false alarms in the United States that could have led to a mistaken nuclear war. Forty years ago, Perry himself was awakened in the middle of the night and told that Pentagon computers were showing 200 ICBMs on their way from the Soviet Union. Luckily, it was not the end of the world, but just a computer glitch. How would President Trump respond if he were told at 3 a.m. that hundreds of Russian nuclear missiles were landing in minutes? Would he have the temperament to realize that it could be a false alarm, or would he impulsively launch a counter attack? No one else has the authority to make this call, and once the missiles fly they cannot be called back. It is shocking that senior officials in the nuclear weapons business do not take the risk of false alarms seriously. They reassure us that the chance of a false alarm is “at an all-time low” and that “the statistical probability that the United States would launch ICBMs as a result of a false alarm is close to zero.” Such language is dangerously irresponsible. One can imagine the same bromides being used before the Titanic sank or the Space Shuttle exploded. The honest truth is that the probability is low but not zero. And the consequences would be astronomical. When it comes to nuclear weapons, it only takes one. Human errors and machine errors do occur. It is only a matter of time before the odds add up to a catastrophic failure. As Perry writes, “we do not have to take that terrible risk anymore. We should not rebuild our ICBM arsenal.” The money saved by retiring the USAF’s ICBM inventory could be invested in America’s more survivable and far more flexible nuclear deterrent options, both of which also have conventional warfighting value. For instance, leveraging the huge investment being made in the Columbia class nuclear ballistic missile submarine program by buying more of the boats, it could make it less expensive for the Navy to procure a conventional cruise missile carrying and special operations derivative to replace the first four Ohio class SSBNs that were converted to SSGNs of a similar capability. This is something the Navy already wants to do , but with just 12 Columbia class boomers slated for procurement, a lack of economies of scale will make it harder to realize. Buying more Columbia class boats would also lower the unit price of for fleet overall, which will, in turn, allow for additional hulls to be procured, or money saved for other priorities—or even just saved outright. Columbia Class SSBN configuration., GAO Investing more heavily in America’s survivable second-strike deterrent does make sense as it serves in an opposite role of the ‘nuclear sponge,’ at least to a certain degree. It ensures that any enemy that attacks the U.S. with nuclear weapons will be destroyed in kind, even if the vast majority of U.S. military and government cease to exist following the initial enemy barrage. In other words, the Navy’s boomers serve as the core of America’s nuclear deterrent and fortify the notion of mutually assured destruction. The B-21 Raider next-generation stealth bomber is also a better investment than the ground-based ICBM force. Bombers offer by far the most flexible nuclear option for U.S. commanders during a crisis and their very presence—often referred to as signaling—can impact the enemy’s decision cycle in positive ways. They can also be recalled and offer a scalable response, a strategy that has been elevated by Russia’s own supposed willingness to employ tactical nuclear weapons during a crisis as part of a strategy called “escalate to de-escalate,” which you can read more about here . Combined with the USAF’s new stealthy Long-Range Stand-Off cruise missile , the B-21, with its high degree of stealth and survivability technologies, offers the ability to hold any enemy target on the globe at risk of standoff or direct nuclear or conventional attack. The B-21’s ability to offer a highly robust conventional strike capability, as well as various other functions, also makes it a key component of America’s strategy to confront threats like China in the years to come. So, investing in the B-21 program more heavily isn’t just about shoveling tens of billions of dollars into a strategic capability alone that is meant not to be used, or worst case, to be obliterated via hundreds of nuclear warheads during a nuclear exchange. It is a true dual-role weapon system by design. USAF There are also other nuclear weapons programs that may need funding in the future, such as the return of ground-launched nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and even those launched from ships and submarines now that Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treaty has dematerialized. Getting the F-35 nuclear-capable is another increasingly pressing issue. Hypersonic weapons eventually moving into the nuclear domain is also a possibility. Spinning up these capabilities won’t be a cheap affair. In addition, we could see an expansion of nuclear arsenals as a whole as other nuclear arms treaties may also dissolve in the not so distant future. So the idea that the current monetary estimate to revitalize America’s nuclear arsenal is highly unlikely to stay put even beyond the prospect of cost overruns of existing programs. Members of Congress are also realizing that the Pentagon’s eyes are bigger than their stomach when it comes to updating and expanding America’s nuclear arsenal. National Defense writes : “We need to modernize our nuclear force and our nuclear deterrent — that’s not debatable,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said at a recent conference hosted by McAleese & Associates and Credit Suisse. “The question is how much do we spend?” The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the total cost of the strategic arsenal will be $325 billion between 2019 and 2026, with the annual bill further increasing in subsequent years as the Pentagon fields next-generation systems. … “We can save money on the nuclear deterrent,” Smith said. “We can’t do everything we’re contemplating doing.” … James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted that the Defense Department is facing a “bow wave” of expenditures on strategic forces. As concerns about the budget deficit grow in the coming years, “there are going to be real tradeoffs that are going to have to be made,” he said during a panel at the Heritage Foundation. Submarines and stealth bombers are less vulnerable to enemy attack than ground-based missiles, and ICBMs are “virtually useless from a signaling perspective,” he said. “Given the budgetary pressures … the tradeoff is most likely to be with the ICBM force,” Acton said. “Deciding to … make those tradeoffs now is almost certainly a lot more cost effective than being forced to make them 10 or 20 years from now” after large investments have already been made in the GBSD, he added. Some will balk at the idea of eliminating an arm of the nuclear triad—the cornerstone of America’s Cold War nuclear strategy. That’s understandable as the concept is deeply ingrained in America’s geopolitical psyche and the defense industrial complex’s very soul. There is so much money tied up in America’s ‘nuclear sponge’ and the sprawling infrastructure that supports it that special interests—from local towns located near missile bases to prime defense contractors—won’t let it go without a fight. The same can be said for the USAF. Losing their ICBMs would result in a massive mission loss and the loss of a ton of funding that goes with it. They may make some of it up in other areas, but not all, at least according to the concept laid about above. Still, justifying the ground-based ICBM force seems nebulous at best and totally counter-intuitive at worst. Even Russia diversified its land-based ICBM force with road-mobile systems that are hard to target in real time and thus far more survivable than their silo-based counterparts. But once again, survivability isn’t the nuclear sponge’s main goal. Minuteman III test launch. , USAF The New START treaty is also an issue. As it sits now, the premier nuclear arms reduction agreement between the U.S. and Russia expires in 2021 , but it can be renewed out to 2026. If it isn’t and the increasingly estranged parties agree to new negotiations, giving up the ICBM force would be a huge negotiating chip to make Russia also give up its most menacing capabilities, some of which are exotic in nature and don’t fall under existing treaty frameworks. Getting rid of the ICBM force under the current New START treaty would also free up more ‘deployed warheads,’ which the treaty puts hard limits on, for ballistic missile submarines and bombers, which would fit into the realignment strategy I laid out above. It’s unfortunate that at least a highly focused independent study of this possibility isn’t being done as the Pentagon is about to begin pumping money into upgrades on its missile silos and their support elements in the near term in preparation for accommodating a whole new missile in the years to come. Doing that now just to drastically reduce the ICBM force when fiscal reality hits would be incredibly wasteful. But above all else, eliminating the ICBM force as a whole would provide a lot of funding for far more flexible and survivable strategic assets, as well as the command and control and support architecture that ensures they will work as intended if the most horrific command order of all command orders gets passed down. By investing more deeply into the other two legs of the triad, America’s conventional capabilities will get a major boost, as well. So, is buying roughly another eight Columbia class SSBNs—12 are currently planned—as well as another 60 B-21 bombers—80-100 are currently planned—and saving more in sustainment costs in the decades that follow, a better investment than keeping America’s ‘nuclear sponge’ viable? I would argue yes.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 3, 2020",The Army Nearly Adopted This Stealthy OH-58X Kiowa Warrior Variant,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army wants a new high-speed, long-range, stealthy attack reconnaissance helicopter to finally succeed the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopter, which the service decided to retire prematurely in 2014 . The service says it needs the new helicopter to meet the operational demands of a potential high-end conflict with a “great power” adversary, such as Russia or China. With all this in mind, it’s interesting to remember that the Army had at least a smaller number of Kiowas with various stealthy features, known as the OH-58X, nearly thirty years ago. Secretary of the Army Mark Esper underscored the importance of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program to the service’s overall modernization goals during a press conference at the Pentagon on Apr. 17, 2019 . He also highlighted work on new long-range artillery , air and missile defenses , heavy armored vehicles , and communications and data sharing networks. The Army says it has made cuts to more than 90 existing programs to free up funding to support these efforts and Esper, along with other senior officials, has faced criticism from Congress and others over many of these decisions. “What I don’t have right now is an attack reconnaissance aircraft,” Esper told reporters . “That’s what I need to penetrate Russian or Chinese air defenses.” The Army’s plan is for whatever design wins the FARA competition, the first phase of which will begin this year , to replace AH-64 Apaches in the Army’s Attack Reconnaissance Squadrons . This represents roughly half of the total number of these gunships that the service has at present. These units emerged after the Army retired the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, ostensibly due to the budget reasons, with the last of those scout helicopters finally leaving the service in 2017. The Army has been without a true replacement ever since. An OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, in front, flies with an AH-64 Apache., US Army “The Apache is the best attack helicopter in the world, but it’s not the best armed reconnaissance helicopter,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Walter Rugen, head of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Cross-Functional Team (CFT) within the new Army Futures Command, told Aviation Week earlier in April 2019. “We need a smaller form factor that can hide in the radar clutter and that has reach.” Previous attempts to replace the OH-58Ds directly, which led right to the ultimate decision to retire the helicopters entirely, suffered from repeated missteps and mismanagement, becoming its own saga, which you can read about in more detail here and here . The Army had, of course, also expected to have replaced the Kiowa Warriors with the RAH-66A Comanche stealth helicopter in the mid-2000s, before canceling that program, which had ballooned in cost and suffered serious delays, in 2004. It is also important to note that the service had been very interested in the idea of stealthy helicopters for decades before Comanche and had invested heavily in related research and development before that particular program started. As early as 1978, Sikorsky had produced a detailed report on low radar cross-section fuselage concepts for its then still relatively new UH-60A Black Hawk. But, had things gone differently, the Army might have already been flying the advanced OH-58X years before the Comanche program came to a close. The origins of the X model in many ways actually trace all the way back to the service’s decision to buy the original OH-58A Kiowa in 1967. Two years earlier, the Army had chosen the Hughes OH-6A Cayuse to be its new scout helicopter, passing over Bell’s YOH-4 , the progenitor of the Kiowa and its commercial Model 206 Jet Ranger . Bell’s YOH-4A during tests in the early 1960s., US Army via Ray Wilhite As it turned out, Hughes had grossly overstated its production capacity and the Army turned back to Bell and the Kiowa to fulfill its requirements. The OH-58As, as well as improved OH-58Cs with its more powerful engine and other updates, outlasted the Cayuse in regular Army use. However, the Cayuse, and further improved variants of the Hughes design, commonly known as Little Birds , found a second life in the Army’s burgeoning special operations aviation community in the 1980s. AH-6 light attack helicopters and MH-6 light transports quickly became a core component of what eventually became known as the new 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , also known as the Nightstalkers. One of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment’s MH-6 Little Birds equipped with side-mounted planks for special operators to ride on during insertions and extractions., US Army At the same time, the Army was experimenting with various light, rapidly deployable unit concepts that would also leverage state-of-the-art technology to help keep them viable against a more robust opponent. An Army test force emerged known first as the High Technology Testbed (HTTB), then the High Technology Light Division (HTLD), and finally as the 9th Infantry Division (Motorized). Over more than a decade, these organizations evaluated all sorts of different vehicles, weapons, and equipment, including, but hardly limited to heavily armed dune buggies , light tanks , ground-launched AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, and ultra-light aircraft . In the course of this experimentation, the question of what kind of helicopters a rapidly deployable light force might use also came up. The original plan was to acquire Little Birds to support the force. This made good sense since the 160th was already demonstrating concepts for rapidly moving these small helicopters to forward locations, even in austere environments, and quickly establishing aviation operations at those sites. But the Army rejected those requests. A much more recent picture of members of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment unloading an AH-6 Little Bird from an MC-130 special operations transport aircraft., DOD Instead, the Army’s high-technology test force managed to acquire a number of JOH-58C Light Combat Helicopters (LCH). The Army had modified these Kiowas for the 160th, but that unit had rejected them in favor of the JOH-6A LCH. The JOH-6A eventually got redesignated as the AH-6C and became the first of the Nightstalkers’ armed Little Birds. The JOH-58Cs received additional modifications as part of the high-technology testing, including one extreme example with a three-barrel 20mm M197 cannon mounted in the co-pilot’s seat and firing out through the helicopter’s nose. This proved to be impractical and dangerous, since firing the gun could fill the cockpit with residential propellant gasses that could choke and blind the pilot. The JOH-58C with the M197 cannon installation., US Army via Ray Wilhite Another example, with the serial number 70-15349, served as a surrogate for an advanced configuration known as the OH-58X. In 1985, the Army’s Aviation Engineering Flight Activity conducted limited airworthiness and flight characteristics testing of this particular helicopter. This initial OH-58X surrogate did not have any stealthy features, though it did contain a number of other advanced systems, many of which the Army obtained commercially. This included a new stabilization and control augmentation system (SCAS) from French avionics firm SFENA , a Direct View Optics (DVO) roof-mounted sight from Ferranti in the United Kingdom, and an unspecified roof-mounted, turreted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor. The DVO, the same model used on some French and British Aérospatiale Gazelle light scout helicopters , had a laser designator, which would have given the OH-58X the ability to fire Hellfire missiles. The JOH-58C configurated as the OH-58X surrogate., US Army via Ray Wilhite 70-15349 also carried over various modifications from its original life as a possible special operations platform. This included modified landing skids that could collapse to lower the helicopter’s overall profile, as well as folding tail assembly, all to make it easier to load and unload the helicopter from a cargo aircraft. It also had the improved tail rotor assembly found on Bell’s Model 206L-3 Jet Rangers . Lastly, there were range-extending fuel tanks and added communications and navigation gear. The Aviation Engineering Flight Activity reported that the helicopter had significantly improved performance over a standard OH-58C, but that it was also more complicated to fly, especially at lower speeds. The test pilots recommended modifications to the SCAS and to alert pilots to potential limitations in certain flight regimes until the helicopter received further upgrades to fully mitigate these issues. That didn’t happen. Separately from the high-technology testing, the Army had also initiated an Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP) to modernize its Kiowas in 1981. AHIP led directly to the introduction of the OH-58D in 1985. The OH-58D, also known as the Bell Model 406, was a significantly more powerful design with an improved four-bladed main rotor. The helicopters also eventually gained a mast-mounted sighting unit with electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser designator. The Army ultimately bought hundreds of new OH-58Ds and converted older Kiowas to this new standard. The first armed examples, sometimes referred to as AH-58Ds, entered combat for the first time in January 1988 as part of Operation Prime Chance . Flying from U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf, the helicopters engaged against Iranian boats threaten U.S.-flagged oil tankers sailing through the region. An OH-58D Kiowa Warrior., US Army The OH-58X effort, which was certainly duplicative of AHIP in many ways, threatened to compete for funding and other resources with the OH-58D program. The Army ultimately canceled the OH-58X project in favor of the Kiowa Warrior. But the idea of an even further advanced OH-58, now based on the D model’s more powerful design didn’t go away. Bell eventually took a Kiowa it had converted to the OH-58D configuration, serial number 69-16322, and turned it into a new OH-58X demonstrator with a major focus on stealthy features. The new helicopter had a chiseled nose profile, making it visually distinct from a standard OH-58D. Bell replaced the “doghouse” on top where the engine and main gearbox sat with one made of a radar absorbent material, according to a 1992 Flight International article . The design also included radar-absorbing “cuffs” on the main rotor mast and hub and on the tail rotor assembly. The rotor blades, mast-mounted sight, and skids all received a special coating to reduce their radar reflectivity. A low-quality image of the OH-58X demonstrator. Note the chisel nose and the “cuffs” on the main rotor to reduce its radar signature., US Army The configuration “works extremely well,” Jack Gallagher, Bell’s OH-58D program manager at the time, told Flight International . It “performs [against known threats] better than anything out there.” Bell also pitched it as a cost-effective conversion for existing Kiowa Warriors, claiming each stealth kit would cost just $200,000, less than $365,000 in today’s dollars. In 1992, the flyaway cost of a new OH-58D was $6.7 million, or the equivalent of more than $12 million today. Another picture of the OH-58X demonstrator, but without the “cuffs” installed on the main or tail rotors., Bell via 1000aircraftphotos.com This was an important selling point for the U.S. Army, which, as already noted, had been very interested in a stealthy light scout helicopter to completely replace all of its OH-58s since the early 1980s and had been investing heavily in research into stealth helicopters, in general, years before that. The stealthy scout helicopter effort, known as the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program, had itself spawned the Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP), which involved experiments with two different helicopters – Bell’s D-292 and Sikorsky’s S-75 – with composite airframes to reduce their radar signatures. But by 1991, when the Gulf War started, despite all of the Army’s investments, none of these projects had yielded an actual production-ready design, at least publicly . So the service turned to Bell, which reportedly modified 18 OH-58Ds into the X configuration for operations in Southwest Asia, but they arrived too late to see action against Iraqi forces, according to Flight International . An OH-58X in US Army colors., Bell via Flight Global As of January 1996, the stealth kits were still in storage and available for use, if necessary, according to Army , the official publication of the Association of the U.S. Army. At that time, Bell was reportedly still working on improving the stealthy configuration. It’s not entirely clear what happened to these remnants of the OH-58X program in the end. The War Zone reached out to the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command’s history office, but they said they could not find any specific records about the final status of the project. Bell’s public relations team similarly said that there did not appear to be any additional information beyond what the company had shared publicly in the past, but added that some details might remain classified. It seems very possible that defense budget cuts in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union may have killed the OH-58X for good, in favor of LHX, which evolved into the Light Helicopter (LX) program and led to the selection of Boeing and Sikorsky’s RAH-66A design in April 1991. The Army had touted Comanche as a stealthy Kiowa replacement, making it easy to see how it could have subsumed the OH-58X project. But the RAH-66A was also significantly more advanced and capable than the Kiowa, with various features, especially its armament package , that were more in line with an attack helicopter, such as the AH-64. In something of a throwback to the original JOH-58C LCH concept, in 1992, Bell had also introduced a non-stealthy Multi-Purpose Light Helicopter kit, which featured similar “squatting” landing skids to reduce the helicopter’s overall height. Sometimes referred to as the UH-58E , this configuration also had a cargo hook under the fuselage for carrying small loads slung below, as well as mounts on either side of the fuselage to fit external platforms for carrying cargo, wounded personnel on stretchers, or inserting and extracting special operations forces. This arrangement was similar in general concept to the planks on the 160th’s MH-6 Little Bird light transports. Bell says that the Army purchased dozens of MPLH kits, but rarely used anything besides the landing skids. There are various pictures that show OH-58D Kiowas over the years with the MLPH skids, but there does not appear to be any photographic evidence of the service using any other part of that kit operationally. An OH-58D Kiowa Warrior with the MPLH skids in Iraq in 2004., US Army Whatever the case, the Army shifted its stealth helicopter focus to Comanche for more than a decade, before canceling that program in 2004. The War Zone has previously explored in depth how the service may have been able to keep the stealth helicopter brain trust alive in the classified domain, helping to produce such things as a stealthy UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopter. The existence of this Stealth Hawk became public in 2011, when one of them crashed during the raid that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. However, the stealthy Kiowa seems to have faded into obscurity. When the Army looked into upgrading the OH-58Ds to new OH-58F configuration in the early 2010s, there were no stealth features as part of the package. The OH-58F prototype., US Army The Army has now come back around to the idea of a stealthy attack reconnaissance rotorcraft with the FARA program. The service’s requirements also demand a design with a top speed of at least 230 miles per hour – nearly 100 miles per hour faster than the Kiowa Warrior – and greatly extended range over previous scout helicopters. Beyond stealth features, this next generation attack reconnaissance platform will also have a robust electronic warfare suite to detect and jam enemy radars and other cutting-edge defensive systems. The Army says it will announce the companies that will take part in the first phase of the FARA program this year and it hopes to down-select to just two competitors in 2020. There will then be a fly-off between the two, leading to the selection of a final winner in 2024. So, while the Army may have largely passed over OH-58X, it may finally get a helicopter with far higher performance and that is more survivable and stealthy than the Kiowa Warrior could ever have been.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 6, 2018",Vandenberg AFB’s Space Shuttle Processing Facility Now Has A Very Mysterious Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nestled to the south of Vandenberg Air Force Base’s massive 15,000-foot runway and connected to it by a long, private taxiway sits a peculiar facility encased inside two layers of security fencing, with its entrance from the taxiway only accessible via a pair of sliding gates. At first glance, its appearance is reminiscent of a high-security prison, but this facility is meant to keep people out, not keep them in. But the origins of this highly peculiar installation are far higher-profile in nature than whatever its mission is now. Years ago, I wrote a feature on Vandenberg Air Force Base’s Space Launch Complex Six (SLC-6) very colorful, but not widely known past . It was built to launch the Air Force’s own Space Shuttle and was a far cry from the expansive Apollo-inherited infrastructure NASA’s Space Shuttles operated from at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Instead, SLC-6 was a remarkably compact facility tucked between the California coastline and the Santa Ynez mountain range. To put it simply, it looked like something right out of a James Bond movie, not reality. SLC-6 with Enterprise mocked-up on the pad. , DoD Part of the infrastructure needed for the USAF’s Space Shuttle program beyond SLC-6 was an Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). A critical piece of the Shuttle’s operation, the OPF was a highly customized hangar facility designed to regenerate the Orbiter after each mission. Originally, this was supposed to include a fairly abbreviated process, allowing for continuous access to orbit on the cheap, but as the Shuttle program progressed, this operations model—and the business case that supported it—dematerialized, with the Orbiters having to go through a months-long and very expensive process of rehabilitation after each use. Regardless, the USAF needed its own OPF at Vandenberg for independent operations. From what we can tell, the base’s OPF was built in a very logical place, just south of the runway that would recover the Shuttle after most missions and where the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft would ferry the Orbiter to when landings at another runway were necessary. With a long private taxiway accessing the end of Vandenberg’s runway, the Orbiter could be towed back to the OPF with ease, where it would be turned around for the next mission. It would then be towed to SLC-6, located 10 miles to the south, for mating with its fuel tank, boosters, and payload before launch. The thing is, none of this ever happened. By the mid-1980s, the Space Shuttle was already proving to be a far more resource-intensive capability than what was originally envisioned. Once the Challenger blew up during ascent, the Air Force canned its Space Shuttle dreams and moved to invest in other ways to access space as it needed, some of which may have been quite experimental and exotic in nature. In the years that followed, SLC-6 was repurposed, although without success, until it found the right fit in the mid-2000s, as I described when I wrote about SLC-6 in 2015 : After the cancellation of the Defense Department’s arm of the Shuttle Program, SLC-6 was used by multiple defense contractors with varying results ( see a full launch list here ). By the early 2000s, a legend that the complex was badly cursed had grown to massive proportions, as so many billions of dollars had been poured into the installation, under the guise of a whole slew of programs, with very little to show for it in the end. Finally, in the mid-2000s, Boeing took over the facility and re-utilized much of the Shuttle’s infrastructure for their Delta IV rocket program . The first Delta IV Medium rocket was triumphantly launched from the long-beleaguered complex in 2006. Since then, the once doomed SLC-6 has performed extremely well launching large payloads into space, most of which contain America’s most high-tech and secretive space-based spying technologies. This is somewhat of an ironic reprieve for the site as it had unsuccessfully been envisioned as facilitating just that mission for close to half a century. While we know all about the history of SLC-6 and how it eventually found success after decades of uncertainty, the Orbiter Processing Facility at Vandenberg is something of an information black hole. I wanted to follow-up on my popular SLC-6 story with a feature about the geographically separated OPF’s own history and what it is up to now, but there was little to no information of any about it. This seemed very odd for something of such historic significance and that is quite large and elaborate and situated on a fairly high-profile Air Force installation. There is nothing secretive about the OPFs at Kennedy Space Center, which has three of them arranged near the gigantic Vehicle Assembly Building. After the Space Shuttle program was shuttered, those facilities have been given a whole new life. Two are leased by Boeing to support the USAF’s X-37B miniature spaceplane program. The other is also leased by Boeing, but is used for their CST-100 Starliner capsule program . Yet when it comes to Vandenberg’s OPF, the tenant is completely unknown. In fact, it seems as if it was never disclosed in the decades that followed the abortive military Space Shuttle program. OPFs at Kennedy Space Center., NASA Check out just how elaborate, large, and advanced the OPFs are: Vandenberg AFB seems to be quite open when it comes to its various tenants and uses for its launch facilities. There are multiple rocket assembly buildings scattered all around the base used for a number of customers and programs, but nothing as expansive as the OPF. With this in mind, I reached out to the base’s public affairs shop in hopes of getting a simple answer as to what the facility is used for today, or at least about its history following the collapse of the Pentagon’s Shuttle Program. It turns out, they are not willing to share any information about the facility or really even comment on its existence. So, this leaves us with an odd mystery of sorts. Secret hangar facilities working on undisclosed projects are usually the domain of remote locales, like those in the expansive deserts of the American Southwest. But really, there is no other facility that comes to mind that is better suited with operating an incredibly advanced and clandestine aircraft that needs a lot of space to operate in. First off, the facility is located deep within an already highly secure facility. This offers high security, but also far better accessibility compared to the remote options in the Nevada desert and elsewhere. Second, the OPF is basically the most ‘Cadillac’ of hangars ever constructed, capable of fully renovating a Space Shuttle with all its exotic materials and workshop needs. Vandenberg’s OPF is even larger than those at Kennedy Space Center. In addition, it was already built and paid for by the USAF for a program that never actually materialized. Google Earth Third, it has incredible accessibility to one of the longest runways in the United States. Whatever lives inside that hangar can taxi—or be towed—from its ultra-secure roost, out directly to the end of the runway and launch without even having to use the airfield’s shared aprons and taxiways. It can do the same in reverse for recovery. If the aircraft in question can be transported by airlifter in a disassembled state, moving it to and from its loading area on the base would also be an extremely secure and private affair. Google Earth Google Earth Finally, and most importantly, Vandenberg AFB sits on the California Coast adjacent to where vast military range facilities are located. Literally, the airspace off Vandenberg is part of gargantuan range complex that extends over the Channel Islands and far out into the Pacific and down along the Baja Peninsula. This is where the Navy and the Air Force do some of their most extensive and sensitive testing, including live missile shoots and highly integrated war games. Combined, these ranges absolutely dwarf those that exist over land, including the expansive Nellis Test and Training Range that occupies a huge chunk of Southern Nevada. In fact, from what we understand, quite a bit of testing of secretive aircraft based in the deserts of the western U.S. occurs over these over-water ranges. Being able to access them without flying over the population in itself is also a huge plus. The huge range complexes that extend out from the California Coast. , Globalsecurity.org We also know that Vandenberg AFB does have a test function for secretive aircraft, in particular, unmanned ones. The RQ-170 program has a detachment there and the bat-winged drones fly from the base’s runways fairly regularly. We also know they use the airfield’s main ramp and hangar for their operations, not the expansive OPF. It’s hard to stress how unique this arrangement is. Although people often think secret aircraft can be shoved in any hangar on any base, that simply is not the case. Few facilities have the ability to offer high-security and isolation, while also ease of operations and access to vast sanitized airspace like what we see at Vandenberg. So, what lives inside the historic OPF today? We have no idea, but logic points to a number of possibilities and one’s imagination can pretty much run down the rabbit hole from there. Something capable of high speed, that would require the base’s long runway and the huge range complex that sits adjacent to it makes a lot of sense. Sonic booms, deep rumblings in the sky, and strange contrails have been present off the SoCal coast dating back to the late 1980s. In fact, those reports continue to this very day . It’s also worth noting that the D-21/M-21 combo , a parasite drone-mothership system that is part of the A-12 Oxcart/SR-71 Blackbird family of aircraft, was tested in secrecy over this range complex as over-land alternatives were far too restrictive and problematic. The utility of high-speed platforms has made a drastic resurgence as of late, with the Pentagon investing billions into hypersonic capabilities of many flavors . One of these is the much talked about ‘SR-72’ hypersonic unmanned strike and reconnaissance aircraft that Lockheed is working on. As I have posited in detail , it seems as if the corporate chatter we are hearing about this craft is a reflection of the past, not the present. Lockheed’s competition is also interested in getting a taste of the USAF’s high-speed reusable aircraft buck. Regardless of who owns it, the OPF would be perfectly suited to such a machine or a technology demonstrator progenitor to it. Lockheed’s notional SR-72 design., Youtube Screencap A reusable spacecraft launched from a larger mothership that sorties from a different location, but recovers at Vandenberg is another possibility. It’s also a concept which we have delved into deeply in the past and one the USAF was interested following the collapse of the Shuttle Program. The OPF’s main bay is roughly 150 feet across as measured on Google Earth, so it’s not a like a massive aircraft could occupy the facility, but something the size of the Space Shuttle certainly isn’t small either. On the other hand, a smaller two-stage-to-orbit space-launch system capable of putting small payloads in orbit could also possibly call the OPF home. A facility used to support a small force of experimental, autonomous, and highly networked unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) drones would also be beneficial as they could use the vast range spaces to put their capabilities to the test. The OPF’s shadowy status would certainly fit with the equally puzzling status of any kind of USAF UCAV program. You can read more about this strange reality here . There are other, far more exotic possibilities to ponder as well, even if just for one’s imagination’s sake, one of which was actually present in the region during a notorious series of events that occurred off the Baja Coast back in 2004. On the other hand, maybe the OPF has a far more mundane purpose. But if that’s the case, why not offer some details about it, especially considering the facility’s historic significance?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 28, 2019",U.S. Infrared Satellite Data Could Settle The Debate Over Pakistan-India Dogfight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s constellation of panoptic infrared early warning satellites is known for providing the Pentagon with the first indication that a ballistic missile launch has occurred and where to cue the attention of other sensors so that the missile can be tracked, classified, and even potentially intercepted . Yet America’s huge investment in orbital early warning platforms, which dates back to the 1960s, has also resulted in a secondary function for these systems—picking up much more than just large rocket and ballistic missile launches. These ancillary events can include the launch of smaller missiles, like surface-to-air and even air-to-air types, artillery barrages, large detonations on the ground… and exploding aircraft. The limited air battle between India and Pakistan that occurred over Kashmir on February 28, 2019, is one of the most hotly contested military events we have seen in a long time. Misinformation flowed like a waterfall in the hours, days, and weeks following the shoot-down of the Indian MiG-21 Bison by a Pakistani fighter, with allegations of systemic deception at the highest levels of government being flung with reckless abandon across both sides of Line Of Control. In fact, it continues to this very day with no sign of abating. Indian MOD/Asuspine We have covered the story in extreme depth and tried to separate myth from reality and knowns from unknowns as much as possible in an attempt to bring an objective and well-versed viewpoint to the alarmingly murky and spiteful debate. But even a month and a half after the aerial engagement happened, what exactly occurred during it remains unclear. India says their MiG-21 pilot that got shot down also shot down a fighter of his own—a Pakistani F-16—moments before his aircraft was struck. Meanwhile, Pakistan claims they lost no aircraft during the engagement and reports attributed to undisclosed sources state that all of its F-16s are accounted for . So, when it comes to the air-to-air side of hostilities, we are left with one crucial question that has tensions boiling between the two long-time foes—was a Pakistani fighter shot down or not? India has produced some far from conclusive “radar data” that they say shows the F-16 being shot down. It also provides general positioning information of the aircraft involved and especially of the MiG-21 in relation to the F-16 that New Delhi says was shot down by its MiG pilot. One of a just a handful of still screenshots offered up as “radar data” by the Indian Air Force shows the position of aircraft over Kashmir when the shootdown occurred. , Youtube Screengrab But with just a few screenshots to go by of said radar data and with Pakistan unwilling to provide any additional info of their own, the two sides seem locked in an informational stalemate of sorts, where one narrative is constantly pitted against the other without end. The thing is that the Pentagon very likely possesses sensor data that can unequivocally prove one story right and the other wrong. That aforementioned infrared early warning constellation includes Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites—the former being the more modern and advanced of the two. You can and should read all about these fascinating satellites and their origins in this past feature of mine. Lockheed Martin It is all but certain that portions of America’s space-based infrared early warning system staring down on the India-Pakistan area as the air battle unfolded. With the two countries possessing enough nuclear warheads to cause significant harm to the globe —many of which would be deployed via ballistic missile—the region is something of a “must monitor” for Department of Defense. This is especially true considering a nearly unprecedented bombing raid into Pakistani territory occurred just a day before the air engagement in question and a full-out war between the bitter foes could have been right around the corner. As we mentioned earlier, these satellites not only have a strategic function, they also have a tactical one in that they have the ability to detect non-ballistic missile launches and other infrared events. In fact, there is an entire Air Force unit tasked with squeezing out secondary surveillance products from these spacecraft that constantly stare at the earther’s surface. And they see a lot. In 2014, over 8,000 separate infrared events were detected and cataloged, the next year was even busier. Slide from a 1998 presentation on SBIRS’ capability. , USAF So, it is probable that any missile launches that occurred that day, whether it was an AIM-120 AMRAAM from the Pakistani F-16 or the R-73 from the Indian MiG-21, could have been detected, geolocated, and catalogized. But it is even less challenging for the satellites to detect a missile exploding in mid-air and causing the aircraft it showers with shrapnel to erupt into a massive fireball. This is not conjecture. The downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Eastern Ukraine was picked up by SBIRS , as was the SA-11’s missile launch that doomed that Boeing 777. The bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268 over the Sanai Peninsula was also detected by SBIRS . So, are we to believe that a fighter loaded with weapons and fuel, flying over what could be an imminent flashpoint of war between two nuclear powers, had a missile blow it out of the sky and it wasn’t detected? Highly unlikely, to say the least. That data could totally validate or invalidate the radar surveillance data India has presented, including correlating the locations of the MiG and F-16 with the geolocations and timing of the infrared events detected. So why isn’t the U.S. setting the record straight assuming it has this information? Geopolitically there is a long list of reasons for the U.S. not to inject itself into a conflict between two nuclear-armed powers with different levels of complex relations with Washington D.C. In addition, the Pentagon has never been all that talkative about the secondary uses for its space-based infrared early warning network and detecting terrestrial infrared events is just one of its potentially secondary applications. Leveraging this information in real time could have huge advantages during a conflict, so it seems to only be talked about when it is absolutely necessary—like the shoot down of MH17, an event that Russia was accused of having a direct hand in. So, there you have it. As the brutal information war on the internet rages on between the two estranged neighbors, keep in mind that the U.S. could most likely settle the debate once and for all with data it has had since the moment the engagement occurred. And this is just one intelligence product among many that the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community can pull from to make an accurate analysis of what went on that day. But as of yet, nobody with the power to do so is willing to offer up such definitive information to put the issue to rest. It’s possible that unless that changes, we may never truly know exactly what went on in the chaotic skies over Kashmir on that fateful day.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 26, 2020",The Only Man Who Flew Both The F-22 And The YF-23 On Why The YF-23 Lost,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what may be my favorite installment in our ongoing series on Northrop’s YF-23 Black Widow, we hear directly from famed test pilot Paul Metz. Metz started his career as an F-105G Wild Weasel pilot in Vietnam and went on to become one of America’s preeminent test pilots. He flew Northrop’s YF-23 on its first flight during the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition that pitted the jet against Lockheed’s YF-22 and also went on to do the same for the F-22A. In the video below, he describes what the ATF program was like from the inside and just how good the YF-23 actually was. In addition, we get extra color on the accelerated flight test program Northrop executed for the competition from test pilot Jim Sandburg. Their testimony combined gives us an unprecedented look into the YF-23 program and paints a clear picture that YF-23 was indeed equal if not superior to its competition. The lecture was put on at the Western Museum Of Flight—where one of the YF-23 is on display—to a seniors group. This gem of historical reference has been largely overlooked even as the YF-23 has risen to near legendary status, becoming one of the most enigmatic and fascinating modern aircraft in history. What’s so important to underline is that Metz worked for both Northrop and Lockheed and is not known for hyperbole. Yet even after flying the pre-production F-22, a far more mature machine than the YF-23 ever was, he makes it quite clear that Northrop’s offering was on par with Lockheed’s, if not superior. YF-23 and YF-22 side-by-side during the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition flight demonstration phase. , USAF The hardest hitting quote comes at the end of the lecture by the two test pilots, where Metz states: “Never hang your head in shame about what we did. We built a tremendous product that would stand side-by-side with anything else, and in many cases exceed the capabilities of anything else. And we can always be proud of that.” Sandberg and Metz also note that both aircraft met the ATF requirements and that Lockheed was chosen because the Air Force had greater confidence they could better manage the program. Metz makes another incredibly valuable point about how Lockheed knew how to present and market their airframe far better than Northrop did. He notes that not everyone who would be in a position to select a fighter aircraft would be an engineer and that they may not even be technically astute. So leaving ‘lasting impressions’ on a conceptual level, even if they don’t tell the whole story technically, can give one side an advantage over the other. Paul Metz was the first pilot to fly the YF-23 and the F-22A. He worked as top test pilot for Northrop and Lockheed. , USAF Northrop’s team was made up of brilliant engineers—Metz says they were beyond compare—but they thought and spoke almost exclusively in engineering terms. Meanwhile, Lockheed infused far more marketing, salesmanship, and pizazz—’lasting impressions’ as Metz eloquently puts it—into their YF-22 flight demonstration program. They fundamentally understood how to sell their aircraft and how ‘showmanship’ heavily impacts the acquisition decision-making process. Northrop didn’t and that fact may have proven fatal for the YF-23. There is so much else in this video of importance to the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition story. Sandburg talks about how the YF-23’s massive tailerons were so powerful that they largely mitigated the perceived advantages of the YF-22’s thrust vectoring. There are many other details about the genesis of the ATF program overall, in-flight emergencies during the flight demonstration phase, how the YF-23’s radar cross-section helped influence its unofficial Black Widow moniker, and even how that famous picture of the B-2 landing with the YF-23 in the foreground came to be.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2021",US Navy Destroyers And Royal Navy Ships Use These Big Blow-Up Anti-Ship Missile Decoys,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke -class destroyers have a comprehensive suite of defenses to shield against anti-ship missiles, including chaff canisters, active decoys that generate confusing electromagnetic signatures, electronic warfare suites , and “hard kill” close-in weapon systems . But they also have the ability to launch passive radar-reflecting decoys that inflate like a huge, oddly-shaped beach ball to entice incoming missiles, a system that came by way of the United Kingdom. Now, the U.K. Royal Navy, which was first to adopt these decoys, is looking to buy an improved design as it looks to expand its global reach . Jane’s 360 was first to report the United Kingdom was looking for a new floating decoy as part of a program known as the Naval Passive Off-Board Decoy (N-POD), on Mar. 3, 2019. This new system will replace the existing IrvinGQ Outfit DLF-3B that the Royal Navy uses at present across various classes of warships and smaller craft, including offshore patrol vessels and minesweepers. This is the same one the U.S. Navy has on its Arleigh Burke s, but the service has given it its own designation as the Mk 59 decoy launching system. The U.K. Ministry of Defense’s Defense Equipment and Support (DE&S) office announced it was “considering replacing the current floating offboard decoy system … with a similar system,” in a notice on Feb. 18, 2019, according to Jane’s . However, the exact requirements are classified “Secret-U.K. Eyes Only,” which also prohibits bids from companies outside of the country. The existing DLF-3B, also known variously as the Inflatable Decoy System 300 (IDS 300) or Floating Decoy System 3 (FDS3), consists of launchers on the ship’s deck, each containing an un-inflated hexagonal decoy. When fired, the lid of the launch canister, which also includes the inflation system, pulls the decoy out and into the water. After the decoy inflates, the lid acts as a drag anchor to keep it relatively stable. The decoy itself is made of a highly radar-reflective material that confuses and distracts incoming anti-ship missiles. It may even be enough to “seduce” the incoming threat to home in on and hit the decoy directly. It can remain afloat for more than three hours. The system is relatively simple to install and links directly to the host ship’s own power supply. It also has a manual launch mode in case of a power loss. Though we don’t know for sure, the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s call for a “similar system” and one that is still passive, suggests that the new N-POD will provide a similar type of defense, but with various improvements. These could include a shell made of materials more adept at bewildering radar seekers on incoming missiles, a shape that is also more enticing to those threats, or features that allow the decoy to inflate faster and remain afloat longer, even in poor weather. The DLF-3B, as its name would imply is already the fourth iteration of IrvinGQ’s decoy system. The original DLF-1 was actually a direct copy of a Soviet design and featured a spherical decoy, which saw only very limited service. This was followed by the more angular DLF-2 and -3, which also incorporated lessons learned from the Royal Navy’s experiences during the Falklands War . The decoys from earlier DLF-series systems., via Federation of American Scientists During the Falklands, Argentinian forces sunk or damaged a number of British ships with French-made Exocet anti-ship missiles, as seen in the video below. These strikes, along with other lessons learned during the conflict, prompting a significant reassessment of Royal Navy shipboard air and missile defenses in the years that followed. In the 1980s, the U.S. Navy was seeing risks posed by anti-ship missiles itself. In 1987, an Iraqi Mirage F1 fired Exocet missiles at the U.S. Navy’s Oliver Hazard Perry -class frigate USS Stark sailing in the Persian Gulf on the sidelines of the Iran-Iraq war, killing 37 sailors and injuring 21 more. The following year it began trials of earlier model DLF-series decoys, eventually adopting these as the AN/SLQ-49 decoy system, which subsequently earned the nickname “rubber duck.” By the 1990s , British surface ships from its Type 42 destroyers to small offshore patrol vessels all had provisions for DLF-series decoys, though they were often only actually installed based on the potential risk of attack. The U.S. Navy had similarly installed the AN/SLQ-49 on all major surface combatants, including its aircraft carriers, as well as various large auxiliary vessels. In the aftermath of the Cold War, American warships steadily saw their rubber ducks withdrawn from service as the apparent threat of a major naval confrontation appeared to recede. The decoys continued to be available for ships throughout Royal Navy, as necessary, though. At the same time, the threat of anti-ship cruise missiles has only expanded in size and scope. Major potential adversaries, such as Russia and China , continue to develop more capable, faster-flying, and longer-range air-, sea-, and ground-launched types. Smaller nations, such as Iran , also have growing anti-ship missile arsenals and the threat is proliferating down to even non-state actors . The United Kingdom is also hoping to expand its own naval capabilities and its maritime presence globally , including sending ships to places such as the hotly contested South China Sea . China has been building up an archipelago of man-made islands in this region with various shore-based defenses , including anti-ship missiles . Trucks carry Chinese supersonic YJ-12 anti-ship missiles during a parade., Imaginechina via AP These plans for an expanded maritime force posture only increase the demand for new and improved anti-missile defenses. DLF-3B will already be a feature on the Royal Navy’s future Type 26 frigates and the improved N-POD could offer some additional protection for the United Kingdom’s new and woefully under-defended supercarrier HMS Queen Elizabeth . Of course, the DLF-series of decoys only provide a defense against radar-guided missiles and would not necessarily be able to defeat weapons with multi-mode guidance systems, including imaging infrared seekers. N-POD could have similar limitations. But they’re also supposed to be just one component of a layered defensive arrangement that includes other active and passive defense systems, such as chaff canisters, active decoys that generate their own confusing electromagnetic signatures, electronic warfare suites , and “hard kill” close-in weapon systems . The DLF-series of decoys have offered a cost-effective addition to those other defenses, with earlier systems, consisting of eight decoys in pairs positioned around a ship, reportedly costing as little as $100,000 in total . Even the improved N-POD is likely to be cheaper than many other defensive options available on the market. Individual Nulka decoys, in service with the U.S. and Australian navies, which actively produce a signature similar to that of a large warship to distract incoming anti-ships missiles, cost more than $1 million each , according to recent U.S. Navy budget documents . https://youtube.com/watch?v=-gTonfJQI_8 Presented with this reality itself, the U.S. Navy began using inflatable decoys again in 2013. That year, the service started installing the DLF-3B system on Arleigh Burke -class destroyers . It’s not clear if other American ships have received the system since then, as well. It is very possible that the United States could follow the United Kingdom’s lead again with the N-POD program. The United Kingdom might also seek to work together with other allies and partners who might be interested in the decoys. The crew of the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Ramage test fire the then-new Mk 59 Mod 0 decoy launching system in 2013., USN As part of its aforementioned plans to increase its posture in the Pacific region, the U.K. Ministry of Defense has notably touted its relationship with its Australian counterpart , which are in the process of acquiring new destroyers and frigates that could be in need of added and improved defenses in the face of increasing regional challenges from the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy. NATO members France, Italy, and The Netherlands have purchased DLF-series systems in the past, as well, and could be interested in an improved version given growing concerns about potential threats from Russia. At present, the U.K. Ministry of Defense hopes to have the first N-POD systems in service by 2023, according to Jane’s . The Royal Navy would then look to reach full operational capability with the decoys two years after that. It will be interesting, figuratively and literally, to see how this new decoy system takes shape. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 28, 2019",Enough With The Indian Mig-21 Bison Versus Pakistani F-16 Viper Bullshit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have never seen such a large and diverse mess of misinformation spouted and parroted with wild abandon about a military skirmish than what has come out of the short spate of Pakistani-Indian air battles that occurred in late February. But one aspect of those operations, in particular, has been so ridiculously mischaracterized by the media, so-called analysts, and the public in general, that the majority of narratives surrounding it have to be called out for what they are— total bullshit . During a Pakistani Air Force counterstrike operation on February 27th, one that came in response to India’s air raid into their territory on February 26th, an Indian MiG-21 Bison was shot down and its pilot , Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, captured. He was returned to India in remarkably good shape not long after. Claims that India shot down a Pakistani F-16 during that same incident quickly followed. What has come as a result of all this has been a full-on information assault of laughably childish narratives that lack any understanding of modern air combat and appear to be largely driven by blind nationalism, political spin, or straight-up stupidity, not reality or fact. India now officially claims that they shot down a Pakistani F-16 and that Wing Commander Varthaman was the one who did it just before he himself got shot down. I have to make clear that we have zero evidence that a Pakistani F-16 was lost in combat. None. That does not mean it didn’t happen, it just means that at this time we have no reason to believe it beyond taking India’s word for it. MiG-21 Bison., Indian Air Force The videos and images being passed around online that supposedly support the downed F-16 claim are pure misinformation made up of repackaged old media from past incidents or blatant mistruths peddled by “open source intelligence” social media congregators and nationalist pundit accounts supporting the Indian side of the long and sad standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. Maybe the most notorious piece of media being used to push the F-16 shoot down narrative is a set of pictures of aircraft wreckage showing what some claim is the outer casing of a GE-F110 turbofan engine. There are many issues with the photos to begin with— Bellingcat even did a big and totally unnecessary write up on it—but one needs to look no further than the simple fact that Pakistan has never operated a single F-16A/B/C/D with a General Electric engine. All of the country’s F-16s have run F100 series Pratt & Whitney engines since Pakistan first acquired the type decades ago. Pakistani Block 52 F-16D. , USAF So, case closed when it comes to one of the most prolific examples of the garbage mound of ‘evidence’ swirling around the incident. Once again, throngs of people, including major news outlets from around the globe, arguing about a subject they know nothing about. But the question of if a seemingly archaic MiG-21 shot down a Pakistani F-16 really isn’t the issue here. The problem is that so many have said that such a loss would have been near impossible or a sign of some sort of super embarrassing blunder by an incompetent Pakistani Air Force, or even that the F-16’s value and capabilities as a modern combat aircraft should be discounted due to the purported loss. This is all absolute and total swill. Here’s why: Modern air combat is not a Hollywood blockbuster movie or an arcade game folks! There are so many factors that go into every single air-to-air engagement—even those that occur in a relatively sterile vacuum for training—that acting as if the loss of a more modern and capable airframe to an older and less capable one is some sort of unheard of and damning evidence as to the latter’s relevance and effectiveness on the modern battlefield is absolutely inaccurate. First off, the MiG-21 Bison that India flies, with well over 100 operational in its inventory, is not the ‘Fishbed’ of the Cold War era. The aircraft was updated with 4th generation fighter avionics and sensors in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Indian MiG-21 Bison loaded with R-73 and R-77 missiles. , Aeroprints/Wikicommons This upgrade included a glass cockpit, radar warning receiver, and a helmet mounted cueing system for firing the high off-boresight R-73 short-range air-to-air missile . Although it isn’t disclosed, it seems to include a data-link terminal, as well. A Phazatron Kopyo (“Spear”) lightweight multi-mode radar was installed in the jet’s nosecone that also allowed it to employ the R-77 beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. That upgraded radar may also have received certain tweaks that have improved its performance or it may have been replaced with an even more capable foreign radar set altogether. Other additions included a bubble canopy with far superior visibility compared to the MiG-21’s original smaller and more densely framed one. Expansive countermeasures dispensers were installed as well. With the ability to carry smarter weapons, the Bison also received a very important piece of equipment from Israel, the bolt-on Elta-8222 self-protection electronic warfare pod. This was cutting edge tech in the early 2000s, but even today it is still amazingly formidable and is capable of wreaking absolute havoc on enemy radar systems—especially mechanically-scanned array fire control radars found on most 4th generation fighters. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IflKPVVBG1M All this adds up to a potent little package for not a lot of money and the MiG-21 already sports certain advantages like small radar and visual signatures from certain aspects, as well as the ability to make hard instantaneous turns and fast supersonic dashes. But when you pair the Bison package with creative tactics and networking, as well as a host of other aircraft and an experienced pilot, it becomes far more lethal than the sum of its parts. You don’t have to take Tyler Rogoway’s word for this . The USAF found this out the hard way during one of the most beneficial learning moments in modern air combat training history. Cope India 2004 saw American F-15Cs paired off against the pointy-end of India’s wildly diverse Air Force. Although India’s Su-30Ks were close to the best thing Russia had to export at the time, and their French-built Mirage 2000s were certainly not to be discounted, the most surprising star of the exercise was the insidious little Bison. Mirage 2000s, Su-30Ks, and F-15Cs during Cope India 2004., USAF During the air combat training drills, Indian Air Force Su-30Ks would use their powerful radars to build-up situational awareness and then data-link their ‘picture’ to other aircraft in the airborne force, which seemed to include the upgraded MiG-21s. Either way, the Su-30 pilots could also use radio communications to inform the Bisons of threats and tactical opportunities. The Bison pilots, running with their radars off and emitting few to no electronic emissions that could alert the F-15 crews as to their whereabouts, would use this situational information to their advantage. MiG-21 Bison pictured packing an Elta-8222 jamming pod., Unknown With their Elta-8222 jamming pods fired up and wreaking havoc on the F-15C’s legendarily powerful AN/APG-63 radar, combined with their already small radar and visual signature, the Bisons would come screaming in out of nowhere to within visual range of the Eagles. They would proceed to shoot the F-15s in the face with their infrared-guided R-73 missiles before blasting by. And even if the Eagles noticed the Bisons at the last moment, the Bison pilots could negate the raw performance of the hulking F-15s by employing the ‘fire and forget’ R-73 nearly 90 degrees of the centerline of their noses using their helmet-mounted targeting system. To put it metaphorically, the Bison wasn’t a cavalry soldier or a scout, it was a ninja. Bisons in formation., Indian MoD Overall, during that historic 2004 Cope India exercise, F-15 pilots found themselves having to react to rapidly changing tactics as the Indian airborne force constantly morphed their playbook in reaction to the Eagles’ moves and entering into visual fights just after picking up the Indian fighters that were already right on top of them on radar. By then the Indians were also locked on, as well. It was a notoriously brutal, but highly beneficial learning experience for the Air Force. And yes, rules of engagement for the exercise were set purposely to fulfill certain training goals and push the Eagle force hard. This included limiting the F-15s from firing their simulated AIM-120 AMRAAMs in active mode radar homing mode and only engaging at 20 miles or less with those missiles in their degraded state. The Eagles were also outnumbered—at times as much as three to one—but that wasn’t entirely uncommon for the F-15C/D force. The U.S. flying contingent was also made up of fleet pilots from an active squadron flying against a composite force of India’s most advanced aviators. But most of all, the Americans lacked their E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS)—a staple of USAF air combat doctrine that traditionally enhanced the F-15’s situational awareness and survivability dramatically by acting as their high-powered eyes and ears on high. F-15Cs and MiG-27s during Cope India 2004. Note that the far MiG-27 is also packing an Elta-8222 pod. , USAF But still, the message was clear—future enemies may be far more tactically resourceful than previously realized, regardless of the quality of their equipment. The Pentagon had to react fast if it wanted to retain its air combat edge. Realizing and facing the shortcomings of equipment and tactics through high-quality training and experimentation, and attempting to remediate those shortcomings as much as possible, is the hallmark of a great flying force, not a poor one. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), which was already slated for the F-15C/D community, would soon find its way on many other American fighters as well. The push to get Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radars that are far more capable than their mechanically scanned array predecessors—and especially more adept at spotting small radar cross-section targets moving fast in the ground clutter even in dense electronic warfare combat environments— was accelerated for the F-15C/D community. F-15C seen fitted with AN/APG-63V3 AESA radar. , Raytheon Other upgrades that are still in the works, including for the F-15 force, were spurred by the Cope India’s after-action findings. For instance, the F-15C/Ds infrared search and track system , which is just in the process of being procured now, would have helped greatly when it came to detecting the Bisons at beyond visual ranges regardless of the electronic warfare systems being employed against the Eagles. You can read all about this and IRSTs in general in this past feature of mine. And what do you know? American aggressor aircraft were soon spotted packing Elta-8222 electronic warfare pods. In fact, Cope India 2004, and Cope India 2005 that produced similarly dismal results, were key factors in enhancing the way American aggressors did business, as well as some of the kit they had to help them replicate contemporary threats. 64th AGRS jet over the Nellis Test and Training Range packing a Elta-8222 jamming pods. The Israeli EW system showed up USAF aggressors in the aftermath of Cope India 2004/2005., USAF In essence, thank goodness for the Bison and the tactics employed by the Indian Air Force during Cope India 2004/2005. It gave those in the USAF that were frustrated with the snail’s pace of key upgrade programs the evidence they needed to get prioritized funding. As I have described in great detail before , the fact that U.S. fighters received an air-to-air dogfight missile with high-off boresight engagement capabilities—the AIM-9X—and a helmet mounted-sight/display with which to target it—decades after the Russians had fielded a similar capability, is still a bewildering and somewhat frightening fact to comprehend. In fact, the F-22, America’s supreme air-to-air weapon, still doesn’t have a helmet mounted sight/display system. F-15C pilot wearing JHMCS., Tyler Rogoway/Author So yes, the Bison can be a wily and capable threat when paired with other aerial assets, advanced electronic warfare, and a playbook of guileful and downright creative tactics. This appears to be just how the aircraft was used during the shoot down in late February. According to reports, the Bison was in the air with Mirage 2000, Su-30MKIs, and maybe most important, the Embraer 145 based DRDO Airborne Early Warning and Control System. This aircraft is not only able to get a ‘God’s eye’ view of the battlespace, including spotting low-flying bogeys and detecting and geolocating the enemy’s radar and communications emissions, but it can share what it sees via data-link or voice direction with Indian fighters. In other words, those constantly morphing tactics and the unique employment of the Bison would have been only more potent over a decade and a half after Cope India 2004 via the help of the IAF’s new advanced airborne early warning and control aircraft. IAF DRDO AEW&C aircraft., Venkat Mangudi/Wikicommons So now that we have painted the big picture regarding the Bison, its capabilities, and how India has employed it in the past, it has to be made clear that we have very few hard facts about the engagement that brought the Bison down and supposedly did the same to the F-16. What was the quality of both pilots’ situational awareness at the time? What was the electronic warfare environment like? Were communications flowing freely or were they degraded? What was the intelligence picture before the sorties even launched? What was the exact position of the Bison in relation to the fighter that shot it down and what was the experience level of the pilot onboard that aircraft? Was the Bison flying at low-level, using the mountainous terrain to mask its radar signature? What was the opposing aircraft’s mission? Was it offensive or defense counter-air? Were the Pakistanis baiting the Indians knowing full well how they employ their fighter aircraft? What was the real-time intelligence picture on both sides? Did Pakistan have intelligence aircraft airborne and sharing info with its fighters? Who knew what was where and when? What weapons were available on both aircraft? What was the exact visibility conditions at the altitude in which the engagement occurred? Was everything working on both jets? What type of plane actually shot down the Bison? If it was an F-16, was it one of Pakistan’s plentiful upgraded F-16A/Bs or was it one of the handful of advanced Block 52 F-16C/Ds in their possession? Maybe most importantly, what were the rules of engagement and the general intent of both parties at the time of the engagement? Pakistani F-16BM dropping GBU-10s., Asuspine/Wikicommons And the list goes on and on. So, if you are looking for some definitive account of the engagement itself, you won’t find it here as it doesn’t exist at this time. Not even remotely close. With all this in mind, is it possible that a MiG-21 Bison shot down a Pakistani F-16? Of course it is. In fact, India’s claim that the Bison got off an R-73 shot just before being shot down fits exactly with what we know about the Bison’s sneaky tactics dating back to Cope India 2004. Does this mean the Bison is superior or equal to the F-16? Or does this put into question the F-16’s capabilities? Absolutely not. Networking alone could have been the decisive factor, along with tactics, experience, and electronic warfare, and especially supporting airborne early warning and control aircraft capabilities. This is not just true for the Bison. The Navy and Marines have 45 aggressor F-5N/Fs that are far less capable than the Bison, yet they fly against fleet pilots daily. We are talking about these old jets standing off against Super Hornets that are packed with AESA radars, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems, advanced data-links, and sometimes even benefitting from E-2D airborne early warning and control support. These F-5N/Fs now have internal electronic warfare suites and other aircraft in their formations during large training drills, like contracted aggressors or Topgun/NAWDC F-16s and F/A-18s, pack advanced electronic warfare pods. But they lack a decent radar, helmet mounted sight and a missile to use it with, and don’t have a data-link for coordinated operations without the use of voice communications, among other deficiencies. Yet just like the Bison, these even less capable F-5s still rack up kills on the mighty Super Hornets. It happens far more often than most would believe. A pair of F-5N aggressors depart in formation., Tyler Rogoway/Author In fact, the Navy just selected a private contractor with F-5s upgraded to a similar, but even more advanced standard than the Bison as their ‘4th generation’ threat replication provider for NAS Fallon Nevada, the home of Topgun. Their competition was offering F-16s. Cost played a major part in the decision, which you can read all about here , but it underscores how sensors, avionics, tactics, and electronic warfare can be more important than the raw performance or age of the platform itself when it comes to modern air combat. Obviously, this rule diminishes greatly when low-observability (stealth) is factored in for 5th generation fighter aircraft. But even with such advanced fighters, old and relatively low-performance aircraft with updated avionics can still pose a threat , especially when employing similarly surprising tactics as the Indians used and when operating as part of a large integrated air combat team that has strength in numbers. In the end, the avalanche of recent direct comparisons of the MiG-21 Bison versus F-16 Viper and who would win in some fictional and largely irrelevant one versus one dogfight carry next to no relevance in regards to recent events, and in general, to a large degree. Anyone who pushes that type of childish analysis—usually paired with a sensationalized headline—as some sort of pathway toward a definitive conclusion on these matters should be viewed as an untrustworthy source. In other words, read for entertainment value only. MiG-21 Bison., Jyotirmoy895/wikicommons The fact is, the side with the more capable sensor and networking architecture and most potent electronic warfare capabilities, as well as a creative tactics playbook and experience to leverage it, can have a far greater advantage regardless of ‘airframe versus airframe’ performance differentials. Above all else, the loss of one aircraft, on either or both sides, in a highly complex battlespace, in a region boiling over with aggression and likely buried deep in ‘the fog of war,’ is not indicative of the quality of an entire nation’s air arm or its overall capabilities and the relevancy of its equipment in any tangible way. Both sides have very capable aviators and a mix of varyingly potent weapon systems at their disposal, each with their unique advantages and disadvantages. So, to those who have been pushing totally unsubstantiated ‘takes,’ peddling fake evidence, spinning what little info is available for political or monetary gain, and/or making grand claims and conclusions backed by a weak knowledge base and childish assumptions about what happened in the skies near the Line of Control late last February, take your often nationalistic and deeply skewed narratives and stuff them up your tailpipes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020","The EA-6B Prowler Has Been Retired, But Its Impact On Air Warfare Will Live On Forever","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has finally happened. The EA-6B Prowler has officially been retired from service by the Marine Corps, the last operator of the type. “Prowler Sundown” has been creeping slowly closer ever since the U.S. Navy retired the aircraft back in July of 2015. The end of the Prowler also marks the end of an incredibly successful legacy for Grumman’s A-6 Intruder family of aircraft that reaches back six decades. It all began with the YA2F-1, an incredibly ambitious carrier-based strike aircraft with thrust vectoring nozzles and ridiculously advanced computer systems for the era in which it was designed—the 1950s. This aircraft, which first flew in 1960, would be refined into the A-6 Intruder , an incredibly heavy hitting and precise nuclear-capable strike aircraft that could haul laughably large bomb loads deep into enemy territory in atrocious weather and at night while flying at very low level. The A-6 entered service in 1963 and went on to fight over in Vietnam for a decade and then on to Libya and Iraq, among other operations, as the decades progressed. Out of the intruder, Grumman and the Navy quickly gave birth to the EA-6A, an electronic warfare variant of the two-seat Intruder that was built to jam enemy air defense radars. Just 28 examples of these aircraft were built, with the first flying in 1963. But the concept was a success and, aided by lessons learned the hard way in the dangerous skies of Vietnam, it ushered in the redesigned four-seat EA-6B Intruder. The purpose-built, carrier-capable electronic warfare jet first flew in 1968 and entered service in 1971. EA-6A prototype., USN Over the EA-6B’s 48 year career with the Navy and the USMC, it only became more capable and essential. After the retirement of the USAF’s EF-111 Raven in 1998, the EA-6B became nearly the sole provider of electronic warfare support for America’s air arms, with just the Air Force’s small EC-130H Compass Call fleet providing limited overlap in capability. EA-6A and EA-6B side by side. , USN As time went on, the Prowler’s tricks became more numerous. The Prowler gained the ability to fire the AGM-88 Highspeed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) to support the suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) role while also offering jamming support with its ALQ-99 jamming pods . The EA-6B’s electronic warfare suite could also be used to jam some communications systems, and towards the end of its career, the Prowler community became quite capable of providing airborne jamming support aimed at disrupting remotely detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that were wreaking horror on American and allied ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The final ICAPIII configured jets , which were what the Marines were flying up until today, are extremely capable aircraft. That upgrade drastically improved the Prowler’s situational awareness, ability to communicate, jamming effectiveness, and human-machine interfaces. It was used as a basis for the EA-18G Growler’s electronic warfare system development, but according to some of our sources, the ICAPIII Prowler could do some things even better than the aforementioned Growler that replaced the Prowler in Navy service. In the last few years, the small handful of remaining USMC Prowlers still flying even hauled LITENING targeting pods , acting in the non-traditional overwatch and surveillance role while also executing their jamming mission at the same time if need be. In essence, even though the Prowler was a remarkably dated aircraft, it too became a true multi-role platform in the twilight of its career. You can read all about what it is like flying missions in the Prowler first hand and how it is different from the EA-18G Growler that replaced it in Navy service in this past tell-all feature of mine. With all that being said, the USMC’s last Prowler squadron, Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 2, or VMAQ-2 “Death Jesters,” based at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, was also saying goodbye to itself along with its mount during a ceremony at the base on Friday, March 8th, 2019. The USMC has not signed up to purchase the EA-18G Growler or another dedicated electronic warfare platform of any kind. Instead, the service will decentralize some electronic warfare capabilities across its flying fleet by using bolt-on Intrepid Tiger pods and MQ-21 Blackjack drones . But let’s be clear, these systems, although capable in their own right, do not provide the high-end electronic attack capabilities against enemy air defense systems over broad areas that the EA-6B or the EA-18G can provide. The F-35B and C, which the USMC is buying, do have a potent electronic warfare suite, but it is focused on self-protection more than large force protection and the broad-area jamming support that the Prowlers and Growlers offer. DoD The 2016-2025 Naval Aviation Vision document states the following about the USMC’s move away from a centralized electronic warfare strategy: “The Marine Corps’ comprehensive plan to address electronic warfare (EW) requirements after the EA-6B Prowler sundown in fiscal year 2019 is Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) EW, which uses modern technologies and integrates multiple aviation platforms (unmanned, fixed-wing and rotary-wing assets), payloads, ground-based EW nodes, and cyber effects to provide commanders with an organic and persistent EW capability. The MAGTF EW concept transitions the Marine Corps from focusing on low-density/high-demand EW to a distributed, networked, platform-agnostic approach. MAGTF EW will complement joint EW assets in support of ground forces and fifth-generation aircraft flying against sophisticated integrated air defense systems.” In all, the EA-6B community, which is relatively tiny compared to those of some of their fast jet colleagues within the DoD’s inventory, flew more than 260,000 hours and were part of virtually every major U.S. military operation during their active service. Yet the one metric that can’t be counted is just how many pilots and aircraft were saved by the EA-6B’s radar scrambling capabilities. Note the LITENING pod on the closest aircraft’s left wing., USMC If there was actually a way to compute that number, I am certain it would be absolutely astonishing. Remember, that for every aircraft the Prowler saved by employing its bag of electronic tricks, it meant that a bunch of other planes and service people didn’t have to punch right back into that hostile environment to rescue the downed aircrew. In other words, the EA-6B had a cumulative effect on survivability rates of American combat aircraft. Prowlers also have been a quiet enabler of America’s stealth aircraft fleets, working as a nearly essential part of America’s stealth technology ‘cocktail,’ since the F-117 flew its first combat sorties. It is worth noting that the only F-117 lost in combat occurred during Operation Allied Force occurred on a night when there were no EA-6Bs providing an electronic attack umbrella for the stealthy jets’ forays deep into enemy airspace. Later in life, the same can be said about soldiers on the ground. How many never knew they escaped with life and limbs intact because an angel of electronic warfare was orbiting over their heads? Now, electronic warfare is becoming a major domain of combat unlike it ever was before . The technology related to the electronic attack mission has never been more important or effective, and much greater capability is on the way. Decades of EA-6B operations informed not only the creation of the EA-18G Growler, but also the electronic warfare strategies and technologies that will help win battles for decades to come. So, even though the iconic Grumman design is no longer in service, this is the incredible legacy the EA-6B and all who worked tirelessly on its rugged, but stubborn airframe, as well as the folks who crewed it, and everyone else who was part of designing it and sustaining the Prowler program over the years, leave behind. It is an absolutely incredible, but often misunderstood record that no plane on earth can really match. The EA-6B has truly been the most important combat jet that the public knows little to nothing about. So as we say our final goodbye to the last of the ‘Grumman Iron’ cadre of tactical jets , we can only say thank you to everyone that made Prowler such a magnificent and long-lasting success.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Pocket Force Of Stealthy Avenger Drones May Have Made Returning F-117s To Service Unnecessary,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone recently outlined the logic behind persistent rumors that the U.S. Air Force, or some other U.S. government entity, might have regenerated some F-117A Nighthawk stealth combat jets for operations in the Middle East, most likely Syria, in recent years. We also noted that there’s absolutely no hard evidence to substantiate these claims. But there is a strong possibility that the United States did deploy another aircraft, a variant of the General Atomics Avenger drone, carrying the base designation Q-11, to meet a similar requirement for a stealthy, but armed platform that could strike high value and mobile targets in contested areas. To quickly recap, on Mar. 2, 2019 , Dutch online aviation magazine Scramble posted claims on their Facebook page regarding the possibility that some F-117As flew missions in the Middle East in 2017. If true, this would have likely occurred because of a demand for the Nighthawks’ particular attributes , most notably it being a relatively quick and stealthly platform that is able to employ laser-guided bombs on moving targets. It also doesn’t represent the high-end of U.S. aerospace technology, especially in terms of its low-observable design. As such, if one was lost, the technological risk wouldn’t be catastrophic. This is a capability gap the U.S. military had had since retiring the first-generation stealth jets in 2008 and only recently regained, at least publicly, with the integration of the GBU-49/B dual-mode Paveway precision guided bomb and associated software onto the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . You can read all about these issues in our previous post here . Officially, most of the last of the Nighthawks are in “ Type 1000 ” regenerative storage Tonopah Test Range Airport , where they have been since their formal retirement more than a decade ago. Between four and six have remained in flyable condition, and have flown fairly regularly, for years . The service’s stated plan has been to permanently dispose of them at a rate of four per year starting in 2017. An official picture of F-117As in storage at Tonopah., USAF But whether or not the United States sent F-117s back into combat or not, the requirements that would have prompted that deployment were still there. If the U.S. government had identified a target it wanted to strike clandestinely and that could be on the move in, say, Western Syria, an area full of Syrian air defenses, it would have had few, if any options, at least publicly, to carry out that mission without being easily detected. This bring us to the General Atomics Avenger , also known as the Predator C . The Air Force appears to have designated at least one variant of this drone the YQ-11 and there are likely be additional configurations, such as an operational MQ-11. These designations are wholly unrelated to AeroVironment’s RQ-11A and RQ-11B Ravens . At the time of writing, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) has not responded to our queries for clarification and additional details on this nomenclature. But more on this later. The video below was General Atomics’ vision for how Avengers would operate on the battlefield circa 2012. https://youtube.com/watch?v=v0dHKWjXn-E Despite its initial name, this unmanned aircraft is distinct from the company’s earlier MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper designs , featuring a stealthy planform reminiscent of Northrop’s Tacit Blue demonstrator and using a turbofan engine for greater power and speed than its propeller-driven family members. Avenger also has a much higher operational ceiling than the MQ-1 or MQ-9, being able to reach altitudes of around 50,000 feet. General Atomics Avenger in front of an MQ-1 Predator, at left, and an MQ-9 Reaper., General Atomics The latest iterations of the Avenger, which are substantially larger than the original prototype, have a cruising speed of around 400 miles per hour, more than twice that of a Reaper, and a maximum flight time of around 20 hours, depending on what payloads it is carrying. In 2016, General Atomics also flew a new variant of the drone, called the Avenger Extended Range (ER), for the first time . The Avenger ER has since demonstrated an ability to remain aloft for longer than 20 hours . They also have the ability to carry weapons, including laser-guided bombs, in their internal payload bays, as well as additional stores on up to six underwing pylons. The Avenger can accommodate various sensor turrets with electro-optical, infrared, and multi-spectral cameras , as well as laser designators, on a retractable mount. This allows the drone to operate in maximum stealth mode until it reaches the target area. These drones, which, like the F-117s, don’t represent the cutting-edge of American low-observable technology, but would still be well suited to conducting discreet and flexible missions over less than welcoming airspace in Syria from bases in nearby neighboring countries. General Atomics says the drones can also self-deploy to a forward operating site or that C-17A Globemaster III or C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft can transport them and other supporting equipment to the desired location. An Avenger with various inert examples of the precision guided bombs it can carry internally on display in front., USN Publicly, the Air Force has exactly one of these unmanned aircraft in its inventory, which it announced it was buying in 2011 under curious circumstances . An initial contracting notice said the service planned to send the drone to Afghanistan for tests, but this announcement was then “cancelled” and edited to redact the planned deployment location. In December 2011 , the Air Force denied that it had plans to send the Avenger to Afghanistan. The initial contracting notice had come shortly after an RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone, likely flying from a base in Afghanistan, had crashed in neighboring Iran, leading some to speculate that the Avenger’s actual missions would be over that country. Another possibility was that it might fly from Afghan bases to conduct secretive strikes against terrorists and keep in an eye on the nuclear arsenal in Pakistan . An Avenger on the ground with its payload bay open., General Atomics What exactly the Air Force’s plans for the Avenger were or what it actually did with the drone remain unclear. An annual history of Air Combat Command (ACC), the service’s main warfighting command, for 2011 includes a section talking about both the Predator C and the then-ongoing MQ-X program , but the comments on the former are almost entirely redacted. The author previously obtained a copy of this document via the Freedom of Information Act. “The next generation RPA [remotely piloted aircraft], or MQ-X as it was more commonly called, promised a more viable solution to meeting the Air Force’s future unmanned ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] needs,” the historical review explains. “Unlike the Predator C which offered only minor improvements over the MQ-9, MQ-X had to be ‘survivable in a contested environment, weather tolerant, and have robust and agile communications.’” The entire, unredacted portions of the section on the Predator C and MQ-X from the 2011 ACC history., USAF via FOIA This is curious commentary given that the Avenger can carry a significantly larger payload than the MQ-9, has a substantially greater cruise and dash speed, and offers stealthy capabilities that the Reaper does not. This same section says that by the end of 2011, ACC had begun discussions with the U.S. Navy about blending MQ-X with the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike ( UCLASS ) program. In February 2012, the Air Force publicly cancelled MQ-X entirely . In retrospect, this is not surprising as anything having to do with advanced unmanned combat air vehicles had disappeared from the USAF’s documentation and vernacular around that time. You can read all about this mysterious saga here . The unredacted portions of the 2012 annual history for ACC, which the author also got via FOIA, makes no mention of this program at all or of the final fate of the Air Force’s lone Avenger. The Navy’s UCLASS turned into an entirely separate debacle, which you can read about in more detail here , resulting in a complete shift in requirements to an unmanned aircraft that would primarily serve as an aerial refueling tanker. Boeing is now on contract to build this drone, known as the MQ-25 Stingray . General Atomics had used the Avenger as a surrogate to test various technologies in support of its own ultimately failed bid for this program . The Avenger’s history with the U.S. government didn’t end with MQ-X. As of 2017 , General Atomics had confirmed the sale of the lone drone to the Air Force, but also the delivery of “up to seven” additional examples to an undisclosed U.S. government entity. The year before, the company also went on the record saying that someone had flown one of these unmanned aircraft over Syria to conduct a propaganda leaflet drop. We don’t know for sure who within the U.S. government owns or is flying the other Avengers, but Air Force Materiel Command’s (AFMC) Detachment 3 flies the “YQ-11,” likely the sole example the Air Force “officially” owns, for test and evaluation purposes, as of 2019. This detachment is situated in Poway, California, home of General Atomics, according to a contracting announcement that appeared on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website, in February 2019 . The detachment also has a so-called “operation location,” or OL-Det 3, spread between General Atomics’ Mojave Desert Flight Test Facilities at Gray Butte and El Mirage Airfields. The testing that Detachment 3 conducts, which also includes work on the MQ-9, supports ACC requirements, as well as those from U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) by way of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). A section from a recent contracting document mentionoing the YQ-11., USAF Another section from another related contracting document describing AFMC, Detachment 3’s mission and operating locations., USAF But the latest editions of the Air Force’s Flight Test Aircrew Training manuals , which the service published in 2017, certainly hint at the existence of other U.S. government Avengers and actual operational activities. These documents include entire sections covering the YQ-11, something that seems incongruous for a fleet of just one drone. To retain their currency on this aircraft type, the Air Force says pilots and sensor operators must conduct landings using the drone’s electro-optical, infrared, and multi-spectral camera systems. It’s worth noting that Raytheon’s product page for its Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) says this system is found on the “MQ-9C,” another designation that has been associated with the Avenger . YQ-11 crews must also fly mission profiles at least simulating the employment of both missiles and bombs. “Qualification in the YQ-11 does not count as qualification in any other aircraft except like YQ-11 series (Q-11X) requiring difference/conversion training,” one of the manuals says. The “Q-11X” reference suggests that there could be additional Q-11 variants, such as an MQ-11A, beyond the “prototype” YQ-11. YQ-11 proficiency requirements as described in Air Force Instruction 11-2FT, Flight Test Aircrew Training, Volume 1., USAF “In accordance with the 2011 defense appropriation act, the Air Force procured prototype demonstration capabilities of the Avenger system,” a spokesperson for the Air Force’s 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, a special projects office better known by the nickname Big Safari, told Flight Global in 2016. “The demonstration has completed and there are no current plans for future demonstrations.” But this wouldn’t preclude the Air Force from operating a separate, classified fleet of operational Avengers. It also wouldn’t prevent the service from being involved in some way with another U.S. government entity’s operation of those drones. Annual historical reviews for Big Safari for 2012, 2013, and 2014, which the author obtained via FOIA, make no mention of Predator C, Avenger, or YQ-11 in any way, though they do have a category simply labeled “Classified Programs.” Tyson V. Rininger / www.tvrphotography.com In addition, all of this could fit in with what is known, and still unknown, about the Air Force’s top-secret 44th Reconnaissance Squadron, which we at The War Zone were first to report on in detail in 2018. The service will not tell us what type or types of unmanned aircraft this unit operates. The 44th has its own convoluted history tracing back to the activation of a separate, secretive entity known as the 732nd Operations Group, Detachment 1. The 732nd as a whole has connections to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Previous media reports have suggested the group acts as a cover for or is otherwise tied in with the CIA’s top-secret drone operations. A patch for the 732nd Operations Group, Detachment 1, showing motifs in common with the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, which flies the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone. This insignia also has the text “Forging the Sword” along with a lightning bolt, sword, and droplets of blood, suggesting this unit had other missions beyond intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance., Flightlineinsignia.com All of this brings us back to the F-117 rumors. There remains no evidence that these Nighthawk deployments ever occurred. There are, however, the on-the-record statements from General Atomics that a U.S. government agency, widely understood to be the CIA, possibly in cooperation with the Air Force, has a fleet of Avengers. There have been no other publicly acknowledged sales of this drone to the U.S. government or any other country. The drone’s manufacturer has also revealed that at least one Avenger was flying over Syria at the same time when the rumors about F-117s heading back to combat were first emerging. The Avenger would have been able to meet many of the same requirements for stealthy, armed platform able to engage static and moving targets that was far faster, and therefore more responsive, than other unmanned aircraft available in the region. The 44th also officially stood up in April 2015, which would have given it months to reach at least initial operational capability ahead of an actual deployment the following year. This unit’s activation could have provided a cover for a much more mature Avenger program under the auspices of the CIA, as well. We also know that Al Qaeda’s number two leader, Abu Khayr Al Masri, died in what appeared to be an air strike on his car involving a special low-collateral damage munition in Syria’s western Idlib governorate in February 2017. More recently, The Washington Post reported, citing anonymous sources, that President Donald Trump had pushed the CIA to begin arming unspecified drones under its control flying over Syria after taking office the month before. Trump also reportedly received a briefing from the Agency about unique air-dropped munitions designed to avoid civilian casualties. This strike on Al Masri’s car is exactly the kind of mission profile – a high value target in a moving vehicle traveling in a denied area where American manned platforms don’t generally go – that seemed to explain why the Air Force or the CIA might have turned to the mothballed F-117s at all. It’s also an operation that an Avenger could have performed and fits almost perfectly with the details and timeline regarding CIA drone operations in The Post ’s subsequent reporting. With all this in mind, the small but critical gap that needed filling over Syria, and possibly over other countries in the Middle East, both friendly and not so friendly, could very well have been filled by the diminutive, but adaptable and relatively low-risk Avenger fleet that currently lives in the darkness. That’s not to say that the mothballed F-117 force wasn’t possibly evaluated to fulfill this role, but taking the human out of cockpit, as well as leveraging the long-endurance capabilities of the Avenger may have been an all too logical alternative. There’s also the possibility that both airframes were put to use to fulfill a similar mission set. The presence of one in the region doesn’t necessarily preclude the other. Especially if the F-117s were assigned to the Air Force and the Avengers were CIA assets. But we know for a fact that a handful of Avengers are flying under some classified umbrella for a certain government agency and that they have been active in the Middle East, and Syria, in particular. The claims that the F-117s were returned to service and deployed to the region, on the other hand, come without any hard evidence at all. If the Avenger has quietly stalked and killed high value targets in sensitive airspace, the program is far more successful than anyone has been allowed to let on.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 2, 2020",German Type 212 Sub Has This ‘Propeller Boss Vortex Diffuser’ To Reduce Its Acoustic Signature,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to submarines, silence is survival, so any way to make a boat quieter is seen as a win and adding technologies that make a submarine both quieter and a more efficient performer is seen as potentially revolutionary. Submarine propulsion is a constantly evolving medium that largely exists in the shadows due to its sensitive nature, but once in a while we get a glimpse of something new. That’s is precisely the case with one of Germany’s Type 212 boats. In the past two decades, propulsors have taken the place of traditional propellers on some advanced submarines, including America’s Seawolf and Virginia class nuclear fast attack boats, which has been a particularly interesting evolution. But now it seems that some smaller diesel electric subs are also adding something new to their propulsion systems that provides better performance at lower noise levels. Enter the Propeller Boss Vortex Diffuser (PBVD). The technology came to my attention when @SSN01, a contact I follow on Twitter, posted a blurb about it. In the images he posted, and others available from the Associated Press and Getty Images , Germany’s Type 212 U36 is shown at its public christening. Oddly enough, the boat’s propeller wasn’t covered during the gathering, a practice that is largely customary any time a military submarine is out of the water. Generally speaking, the propellers on combat submarines are usually considered quite sensitive for a number of reasons, one of which is that adversaries could supposedly get an idea of the acoustic characteristics of the boat if they have detailed images of the propeller’s geometry. This clearly wasn’t a concern for the German Navy or ThyssenKrupp who builds the Type 212s when U36 was christened in 2013. It is the newest Type 212 in service with the German Navy. AP The cylindrical PBVD system sits over the hub of traditional submarine propellers. Its specially machined core works to greatly decrease turbulence and cavitation that emits from the spinning hub. This not only cuts down on the propeller’s audible signature, but it also improves propulsion efficiency and thrust. AP Interestingly, the basic concept behind this technology really isn’t secretive or new as it is also used in commercial applications where increased efficiency even in single digit percentages can mean big fuel savings over the life of a vessel. Commonly called Propeller Boss Cap Fins (PBCF) in the commercial world, the technology was developed in the 1980s and it’s in fairly widespread use today with thousands of ships sailing with them installed. Wärtsilä’s EnergoProFin is one such product that comes with a manufacturer’s claim that it can cut fuel consumption by as much as five percent for large vessels. Marine Propulsion describes the EnergoProFin’s effectiveness as such: “Weakening the propeller hub vortex behind the propeller decreases propeller resistance and manifests itself as increased thrust. The deflection of the flow aft of the propeller by the optimized profiled fins reduces the propeller torque. In addition to the improved propulsive efficiency, the new Wärtsilä EnergoProFin propeller can also be applied to reduced propeller-induced noise and vibrations.” Left is a normal boss hub and right is one with the EnergoProFin integrated into it., Wärtsilä The adaptation of this technology seems to be pretty much a no-brainer for the military submarine industry. Still, its migration to the underwater realm is quite intriguing and the complex cylindrical design of the PBVD seen on U36 is clearly more intricate than the fin systems used on its commercial cousins. This is likely due to the submarine prop’s higher RPM and unique focus on maximum reduction in cavitation and noise production. mol.co.jp/apmaritime.com It’s not clear what other submarines have leveraged this technology, or even if all the Type 212s and their derivatives are fitted with it. But if it is greatly effective, maybe it will compete with the propulsor on certain future designs, especially when cost, reliability, and complexity are factored in. Some simpler finned boss cap extension designs have existed in the past on certain submarines. Russian ones in particular, from the crazy fast Alfa class of the Cold War-era to the latest Kilo class submarines being produced today, use a simple finned design, but the Type 212’s device is far more complex. The Alfa class had a boss hub extension that helped reduce cavitation around the submarine’s hub., Public Domain With that in mind, we just don’t know if this is a technological breakthrough from the Germans or not. It is possible and we will keep our eye out to see if a similar system pops up on other submarines. Regardless, it certainly looks cool!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On this day, June 3rd, 1983, War Games starring Matthew Broderick hit big screens across the United States. The movie had all the staples of a 1980s Cold War techno-thriller—a super powerful, blunt, and ruthless military-industrial complex, cutting-edge tech way beyond reality for the time, computers and more computers, and of course, ‘super kids’ that play the film’s protagonists and the main problem solvers. The movie actually spoke to an ever more glaring reality of the time, that a major nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union would end in a world-shattering loss of life. The film’s most memorable line, voiced by a computer, underscored just how depraved the stakes were: “The only winning move is not to play.” At its core, War Games was about hacking and the vulnerability of networks and computers themselves. I mean, the whole plot begins with high school age Matthew Broderick’s character hacking into NORAD’s computer network from his early 1980s personal computer in his bedroom. This cyber vulnerability plot point ended up changing the course of U.S. national security events. ​ ​​​ Fred Kaplan, author Dark Territory : The Secret History of Cyber War— also a guy who a Pulitzer Prize for outstanding journalism — recounts how President Reagan’s screening of the film on June 4th, 1983 at Camp David ended up having a major impact on U.S. cybersecurity and defense policy going forward: Yes, you read that right, the dawn of the U.S. government taking cybersecurity seriously across its entire enterprise, and especially its sprawling strategic command and control infrastructure, was largely born out of the movie War Games . You can read the groundbreaking 1984 directive that came out of the President’s inquiry here . What’s even more intriguing, is that War Games opened just three years to the day of one of the most dangerous moments in the Cold War, when the U.S. thought it was under attack by thousands of Soviet ballistic missiles. The cause of the near-apocalyptic false alarm? A $0.46 computer part. War Games was a fun, but also a somewhat chilling movie, that unfortunately resonates once again as we sit on the precipice of another potential nuclear arms race . It’s worth another viewing, if only to remind us that sometimes the only way to win the game is to not play it in the first place.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 20, 2024",Tom DeLonge’s Origin Story For To The Stars Academy Describes A Government UFO Info Operation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Key players on the To The Stars Academy team—a group with curiously impressive resumes from the military industrial and intelligence complex’s highest rungs and darkest corners—are virtually everywhere in the media right now. In what has been one of the most impressive media pushes I have seen in a long time, the group has gone all out in promoting their new show, Unidentified , on the History Channel. At the same time, as if right on cue—which isn’t all that surprising—huge UFO-related stories have hit the mainstream media. These have included on the record accounts of Navy fighter pilots recently encountering UFOs and an announcement of the service’s own rule charges regarding how personnel report these incidents. We have gone in depth on each of these stories in an attempt to cut through the static and get to the truth, or at least the possibilities surrounding what could end up being the truth. Yet one of the most fascinating, but seldom-discussed elements of this whole story is how To The Stars Academy Of Arts And Sciences came to be and who the mysterious people were that had a direct hand in making it a reality. Even by its principal founder’s own bizarre, yet highly detailed account, which you will read in full in a moment, it sounds far more akin to the making of a tightly controlled government information and psychological operation than the result of a group of highly-qualified people who were interested in accessing new insights on the subject of UFOs. Enter Tom DeLonge, the former Blink 182 frontman-turned UFO impresario who is very much the central figure that brought To The Stars Academy to life even though his role in the quasi-research and entertainment corporation has been subdued publicly in the months leading up to the premiere of Unidentified . This has included the removal of some online videos featuring Tom talking about the strange journey that led to the establishment of the company and its impressive roster of advisors, as well as jump-starting its various highly-ambitious initiatives. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-gr-A4ebLeE Tom definitely has one of the most fantastic tales you will ever hear as to how this all came to be. He has told the story numerous times with varying degrees of cohesion, hyperbole, and eyebrow-raising claims mixed in. But we have to stress, the nuts and bolts of his account have remained remarkably consistent over the years and we can now say, in a War Zone exclusive, that the narrative seed that anchors Tom’s entire yarn is indeed factual . This surrounds Tom’s claim that an employee party at what we found out to be Lockheed’s Skunk Works started it all. This chance opportunity evolved into high-level meetings with top officials from the world’s premier bleeding-edge aerospace design firm and catapulted him into a purportedly clandestine world that would make any espionage thriller writer blush. This confirmation doesn’t come from undisclosed sources, but directly from Skunk Works itself. This is the official statement the Skunk Works gave The War Zone regarding Tom’s early engagement with the company nearly a half-decade ago and the circumstances surrounding it: “Tom DeLonge reached out to Skunk Works with interest in collaborating on a documentary focused on secret machines and advanced development projects. Multiple members of the Skunk Works team met with DeLonge to explore his vision for the documentary, as we would with any individual or organization interested in telling the story of Skunk Works and the technologies we’ve developed. We ultimately decided to not move forward with our participation in the documentary. During this exploration period, DeLonge attended a Skunk Works employee event.” This admission is remarkable as it heavily lends truth to the rest of Tom’s remarkable story. After the meetings at the Skunk Works, Tom claims to have met with top officials at NASA, the Air Force, the U.S. intelligence apparatus, and the highest rungs of U.S. politics, all of who worked cooperatively to provide him with a highly qualified team of deeply entrenched government insiders to help direct his efforts and to supply him with what can only be considered amazing information. That information would be doled out piece by tiny piece and the release of it to the public would be tightly controlled under strict terms. Tom elaborates on his pitch to the powers that be in which he notes the military industrial complex has been painted in a very bad light over the years, with its image being degraded massively within the public sphere, and especially among millennials. He went on to explain how he and the entity he wanted to create could change these perceptions and e ven help with plausible deniability as the information he was given slowly trickled forward. Amazingly, DeLonge says that the officials that agreed to help him thought that the timing was just right for this type of very suspicious arrangement. In all, one can easily, if not undeniably read his own story as the government assembling a novel non-governmental information platform that sits somewhere between credible and questionably credible and that can work to directly mold the public’s perception of the UFO phenomena and defense-industrial complex. It would be easy to disregard Tom’s story due to a number of factors, including an avalanche of fantastical claims regarding paranormal issues, including UFOs, that he has made over the years. One particularly unfortunate interview with Joe Rogan could be enough in of itself for some to walk away from all of Tom’s claims. But for the purposes of this piece, we won’t get into those statements as the cold hard truth is that the very entity and group of advisors Tom said he was assembling under far-fetched circumstances years ago has indeed materialized to an equally fantastical degree. In fact, many of the people he didn’t name directly in interviews dating back to 2015 have now been publicly disclosed or sit directly on his council, and they are impressive folks indeed. Like a punk rock King Arthur of the UFO community that is supported by a round table of extremely qualified people that have mountains of credibility and professional connections in their quivers, DeLonge, his team, and a group of fresh UFO-obsessed enthusiasts, filmmakers, bloggers, and commentators have turned the long laughed at UFO community on its head. As it sits now, it can’t be denied that their collective work has thrust the UFO issue from the laughing stock of fringe science and tin-foil hat culture into the headlines of the mainstream media. But, and this is a very big but, whose narrative are we really hearing? According to Tom’s own account, it is one that was dictated by the deepest and darkest power brokers within the defense industrial complex, not independent research and sourcing. And what are these people’s true goals if that is indeed the case? Really, that doesn’t matter all that much for the aims of this exposé, because even if all the info provided to DeLonge is true and his council of insiders has honest motives, then we are still talking about To The Stars Academy Of Arts And Sciences being at least partially built by the government and its agents. The company’s board of advisors alone underscores this. Some just left the government or the defense industry to join DeLonge, which can be considered highly curious in itself, and a number of these individuals are still working as contractors for the government on highly sensitive matters and hold substantial security clearances. So, this is where an inconvenient paradox lies. If we are to believe the word of the founder and kingpin of To The Stars Academy and the products it is creating and the information it is conveying, then we are talking about at least having to deal with the reality that the government and top officials from the government had a direct hand in bringing the entity to life. And, judging by To The Stars Academy’s roster alone, it still has at least an indirect influence in its ongoing operations. Regardless of if all this was done for disinformation purposes, or conversely for disclosure purposes, or some other reasons that remain unclear, a simple fact remains unchanged—the narrative we are being fed comes from, or at least came from, Uncle Sam. On the other hand, if Tom is not to be believed and his detailed accounts are false, it brings into question the veracity of anything To The Stars Academy does, including its television show that is not an independent documentary, it is their wholly edited narrative alone. Photo by Joby Sessions/Total Guitar Magazine via Getty Images With this being said, we now do know that Tom isn’t lying on the basics of how this all started, at least when it comes to meeting with Skunk Works officials. Other independent evidence exists that also supports his claims long after they were initially made. Some of that evidence is noted within Tom’s story below. In fact, today one of the Skunk Works’ top engineers and executives— Steve Justice, Skunk Works’ Aerospace Division Director up until a short time ago—is now a top player and paid employee on Tom’s team. We do have to note that the Skunk Works has made it clear to us that Justice and his projects at To The Stars Academy, which supposedly includes building exotic propulsion systems and flying machines—a highly questionable proposition in itself—have nothing to do with the Skunk Works and the two entities are not partnered in any way. The only way for you to understand just how explosive Tom’s To The Stars Academy origin story is, is to consume it whole yourself. A portion of one interview in particular, by someone I think is among of the best interviewers around, George Knapp , occurred in March of 2016 on Coast To Coast AM. At this critical time, Tom was in the process of building a multi-platform information and entertainment company that focuses on so-called paranormal issues and, in particular, the disclosure of the existence of UFOs—this would become To The Stars Academy Of Arts And Sciences. During this same period, Tom’s fiction book Sekret Machines , was just about to hit the shelves and he was already well on his way to what sounds like one of the world’s most surreal business startup adventures. Of all the interviews I have heard with Tom where he recounts this story, this is the clearest and came at a moment when a more sanitized and corporate-influenced narrative wouldn’t have been in place. ​ ​​​ Here is the relevant portion of that interview: Geoge Knapp: Well, let’s get into it. You’ve made this decision, and it’s risky for you. I remember when you were just making the decision at the announcement, “Alright, look, I’m done with Blink 182.” There are people online that practically wanna shoot you. And they were really mad. But it’s risky for you financially to do this. The Sekret Machines is a big project. It’s gotta be financially viable, or it doesn’t make it. Tom DeLonge: Yeah, it’s a real project. I have a company that needs the projects to work. The whole thing is risky in many ways. I think we can even start back a little earlier, there’s gonna be a teaser that launches here shortly, that has some clips from the documentary side of things that I’m doing. And in it, there is a person that’s silhouetted, that’s been a very, very high-level defense contractor and engineer out at Groom Lake, Area 51 for decades. And he says something in that teaser. But that person long ago, I remember when I was telling him a little bit about what I wanted to do, he gave me a call the next day and called me on a video chat. So he gets on there and he goes, “I made calls about you,” and I said, “Really?” And he said, “Yeah, I did.” He goes, “You’d better be really effing careful. If someone comes up to you and asks you to get in a car and go for a ride, don’t get in that car.” And I laughed it off and I said, “Come on, man,” I literally, it sounded like a movie to me, so I kinda of just chuckled, and he goes, “I am being really effing serious with you right now. If someone comes by and asks you to go for a ride, don’t get in the car. I am not effing around with you.” And he’s pointing at me, “I’m being very serious. You’re playing with some serious stuff,” using a different word. And at that point my heart was beating really fast and I said, “You’re being very serious right now, aren’t you?” He said, “Yes, I’m being very, very serious with you.” And because of that conversation all the events that transpired after that when I started meeting certain people, I went in very, very respectful and asked for permission on everything that I did and treated it the way that these guys treat it, which is, it is a national and global security issue. GK: Let us talk about the process of how you sort of pierce the veil, ’cause that’s what people are gonna have trouble buying. How is this guy, how is it this rock star guy gains access to this when so many people, senators and researchers and scientists and spooks, who have tried to look for this stuff couldn’t find it. How do you get the access? How do you explain that? TD: Well, I might as well just tell you the story. So the way, the first… It spells this out a little bit in the forward to the book. But I had an opportunity to go to an event. So the most classified and the most advanced group of engineers and scientists that work within the military industrial complex work under one specific group. And it’s a very, very quiet group. But for the very first time they were doing an event where family members can come, and not go in the buildings, but at least celebrate in the parking lot what their loved ones do during the day. And they asked me, “Would you come up?” And because I knew this one individual that told me to be really careful, he goes, “Hey, look, this is a way for you to come up and see a little bit about what we’re doing.” And I said, “Oh my God, I would love to.” And he said, “Do you wanna come and introduce the head of the company to the crowd?” And I said, “I will if I get to sit with him for five minutes.” I don’t know why I said that, I just knew that that was an opportunity that guys like me would kill for, because I knew exactly who this group of engineers were, I knew exactly what they do. So the head guy, are you kidding me? Yeah, let me, lock me in a room with this dude. And so I got that opportunity, I went up and I did the introduction to the crowd and then I got the five minutes to sit down alone and say whatever it is that I wanted to say. So at that time, I didn’t say anything about this subject. I just said, “Hey, I have an idea for a project, and this project, I think if it’s done correctly, will reverse the cynicism that people have about government and what people have about the, frankly, the military industrial complex. I think that if I do this, places like this and other arms of the government would be happy that it got communicated.” But I didn’t bring up anything that was… GK: You didn’t mention UFOs. TD: You don’t mention UFOs. Don’t even do that, ’cause you’ll get kicked right out of the door. So he goes, “Okay, that’s great.” And I said, “Can I come up in a couple of weeks and tell you more about it?” “Absolutely.” So a couple of weeks go by and then I come back up, I go through four layers of security, I go through machine guns, guys with machine guns, and then I get escorted into a very specific building that’s with a bunch of buildings. This is somewhere out in the middle of the desert somewhere. And then I go through two layers of electronic code entry systems. And then then you hear the lock go. They make their sounds and the doors open up. Now I’m in a hallway, and that hallway has speakers lining the ceiling just playing white noise, kinda like TV static, and that’s there so you don’t hear anybody’s conversations. And the hallway also has a series of doors and all the doors have those big rotary locks, like a safe lock on ’em. So then, so we go through the hallway and then they just twist the knobs on the doors and then you hear the big sound and that door opens up. And now I’m in the center of the building where the top three engineers work with the head of the company. And so I walk in and they’re sitting there and they’re ready for what it is I wanted to pitch them. So I’m nervously trying to figure out what I’m gonna say. I had no idea that, I had no plan for even bringing up UFOs then either. I was smarter than that. So we’re talking, and one person apparently did a bunch of research on me and knew that I was all into the subject. So halfway through the conversation this person says, “So what about all the conspiracy stuff that you’re into?” And so now I’m being eye-balled by three very important people and I’m just totally got caught, and I’m like, “Oh, my God, what am I gonna do right now?” So I tried to talk my way out of it. And then in comes the head of the company, the big, big dude, and kind of saved the moment, but at the same time he got introduced to the conversation right at that point. So right when he, right… I said, “You come in at a very interesting part of the conversation. This person brought up the whole UFO issue with me. I just want you to know that I don’t plan on treating that disrespectfully with this project.” And then I got interrupted. And the head guy says, “We cannot be involved with anything that has anything to do with that subject, especially since there has been absolutely no evidence whatsoever that it exists.” So, bam, I’m just cut off right there, and now I’m my heart’s racing, and I’m like, “What do I do?” So the only thing that I can think of at the moment, is I said, “Well, Edgar Alan Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the Moon, is out telling all the young people of the world that this is real. So we have a credibility issue that we have to attack, but we don’t have to attack it here or now, and we could talk this through. It’s just something that young people think, and I want you to know a little bit more about my project.” And so I got my way through, I was like, “Oh my God, I’m still here.” So they said, “Okay, continue.” So that specific meeting ended and then I just said, “Hell with it.” I said, “Sir, can I speak to you for five minutes alone?” This is the Tom that even my old band members know, I’ll just go for something. This is the punk rock kid inside of me, right, and he goes, “Sure.” And so the other people look at me weird and they’re like, “Okay, so we leave?” And I kinda looked at them, so they did, so they stood up and I shut the door, and now I’m in the middle of all these different layers of security, and I’m sitting with this person and I just go for broke, I just go, this is exactly what I said, “I want you to understand something.” And I sit down two feet in front of him, and he’s staring at me in the suit. And I go, “I understand the national security implications about what I’m about to say. I am not naive to the topic. And I think if you hear me out, you’re gonna see that there’s merit in what I’m about to propose.” And he goes, “Well, what topic are you talking about?” And I go, “UFOs, sir. Now, this is what I wanna try and do.” And so then I just laid out this entire Sekret Machines project idea and I said, “I’m going to send… ” And I said, “But over the past 30 years, there’s been a program to indoctrinate people to the idea that this might be real, but the problem is, is all the young adults of the world, they use the Internet, they have iPhones, they talk to each other much quicker than people ever have, so this program that everyone’s been following from the ’50s is far out-dated, it’s antiquated, people have surpassed it and now they don’t trust you guys, now they don’t like you guys. Now they graduate from MIT and they wanna work for Elon Musk and they don’t wanna work here. Help me help you guys.” And then he stops me, and ’cause I said, “Frankly, there’s been some bad things that have happened for the past 30 years on this subject.” And he stops me and I’m kinda going, “Okay. So now I’m in trouble. I just went right into this stuff. What’s gonna happen?” And he looks at me, he takes a breath, and he goes, “What kind of bad things has the government done with the subject?” Very, very calm, and staring me straight in the eyes. And so I came up with a couple of things that I can’t say here. And I said, “If you allow me to do this, what I’m trying to do, then I’m gonna ask you for some help. I need advisors, I need people to help guide me, so I don’t keep dis-informing people, I will not do that anymore. We need to tell the truth. And I just… ” You know what I said at the time, I said, “You gotta picture those little chickens running across the road and someone’s guiding them.” I’m all, “I’m that little chicken and I’m racing but I don’t wanna get hit by a car on the way.” [chuckle] But it was no joke. There was nothing to laugh at during this time, so I said, “I’m going to send you something. I want you to read it. And please, if you find anything about it good… If there’s any kind of merit in this at all, just respond any way you can,” because I didn’t think he could respond in an email or anything. He goes, “Okay. Thank you for that,” and then the meeting was done. [Author’s note: As we mentioned in our lead-in, Tom’s story about attending an employee event at what turned out to be Lockheed’s Skunk Works and later meeting with officials from the elite aerospace engineering outfit about his projects does check out. At this time, we have no way to corroborate what exactly was discussed during these talks or what came out of them. We also know from the leaked Podesta emails that in 2016 Tom openly discussed in correspondence about being in direct contact with Rob Weiss , the head of the Skunk Works. Calendar invites for a virtual meeting from Podesta’s emails include participants Tom DeLonge, Rob Weiss, and retired Air Force General William N. McCasland. “The General” will prove to be a central figure in Tom’s story later on. Originally, Tom kept the general’s identity somewhat hidden, but that has since changed. He was even mentioned directly in the first episode of Unidentified . You can see his service record here . It is a remarkable mix of some of the most high-security positions in the United States Air Force, including commander of the vaunted Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB. He is now the Director Of Technology at The Space Enterprise Consortium .] Maj. Gen. William N. McCasland., USAF So what I did was, the non-fiction book that we’ve been working on right next to the Sekret Machines novel in parallel has, it’s a thesis of the UFO phenomenon. So I took the prologue to that thesis and I sent it to him. And I’m sitting there going, “Oh my God. What did I do? What I did I do? I shouldn’t have sent it in an email.” Obviously, you don’t send it in an email. Every email you have with this group, it has all these government stamps all over the email, ’cause it goes through, it goes through DOD servers and all this stuff. But I had no other way to get it to him, so I did. So I just sat there and I didn’t hear anything for a couple of weeks so I was like, “Okay. That relationship is done. I fried that thing.” I went in there talking about… I tell people it’s like walking in to somebody during World War II, and say, “Hey, about that nuclear bomb you’re building in secret, I wanna talk to you about that.” That’s basically what I did. Well, two weeks later, I get this email and it says, “I want you to be next to the Pentagon, at this date, and this time, you’re gonna be meeting somebody from the CIA,” basically. It said it in a different way, but I can’t say what it said. And so I was like, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It’s working.” So I get on a plane and I fly out to DC. And this is where it gets pretty sketchy, but it was insane. So I go to my meeting. I had to go to a very specific location that was within a rock’s throw of the Pentagon. And I go to the back of a room at a certain location, and there’s two guys in suits, waiting at a table for me. So I go and I sit down at the table, and the person I was talking to is one of the persons, and he goes, “I think this would be a good time for you to tell this person what you told me.” And I’m sitting there, kinda in my mind I’m going, “Well, what do I say? Do I tell him everything I told you or some of the things? Am I allowed to tell him that I told you these things, or… ” I had no idea what to say, so I said, “Okay. I’ll just go for it.” So I went through the exact same pitch. So I talked about 20-some minutes because they were just eye-balling me like hawks. So at this point, I just don’t know. I’ve never been in this situation before, so I didn’t know if I was saying the wrong thing or not, but I was just trying to be very respectful and I went through with it. And I finished my speech, and the person is just staring at me. These squinting eyes, the beard, the suit, looks exactly straight out of a movie, an espionage movie. Takes a breath and goes, “Things like this don’t happen at the White House. They don’t happen at the Hill. They happen in places like this, at tables like this, where a few men get together and decide to push the ball down the field.” And then the meeting was done. I mean done, like a movie done. So the very next day, I got sent over to NASA. And I’m at the highest levels at NASA, and I decided to do the same thing where I ask everyone to leave. So this one person, I did the pitch one more time, and they said, “You need to meet somebody.” So that person flies out to San Diego. I go to another meeting. We get on a conference call, and this person is a very important… In the military. I can’t say which branch, but the highest level of ranks. But then after they left that particular branch of the military, they did something very, very important for another agency. And that person says, “Come fly and meet me up here in San Francisco. Within the next 48 hours.” So I got on a plane and I go there. And now I’m sitting on a NASA Ames. NASA has three divisions. There’s Ames Research, JPL and then just NASA, the traditional NASA that everyone knows. I’m at Ames Research Center, and I go through my whole pitch again, and this person stops me and goes, “I just want you to know I’m a skeptic on this stuff.” [Author’s Note: We have an ongoing inquiry with NASA to verify what Tom’s relationship has been with the agency and if, when, where, and why he was given access to NASA installations and officials. We have yet to hear the NASA public affairs office’s findings on the matter.] And I said, “I understand that, sir, but I knew you would say that, but let me just continue and tell you what I’m trying to do.” 20 minutes later, “I just want you to know I’m a skeptic.” And I go, “I know. I know you are. You already said that.” [chuckle] And I keep talking. By the time I got to kinda concluding what this project would be, he’s just staring at me, and then he takes a deep breath and says, “Introduce him to the general.” And then I was like, “Well, who’s that?” And they’re both just staring at me, ’cause there was this guy that was right next to him. A very serious guy. And all of a sudden, on my email, two hours later, I’m talking to somebody that has changed the entire course of this whole project. So I get on the phone with that person, that same evening, and I go through the same situation. So I’m starting to walk through what I’m trying to do and how I plan to do it. And this person goes, “I want you to know I’m a skeptic on this stuff.” And I go, “Sir, I knew you would say that, but let me explain a little bit more.” So I walk through it again, and then the person goes, “I just gotta say it, I’m a skeptic.” It was verbatim, what I… GK: They all do it, right? They all do it. TD: They all do it. They all do it. But on the third time, he goes, “I swore an oath to my country.” And I said, “Sir, I know you did, and I’m not asking for you to give me classified information. I don’t deserve it. But I think if you understand what I’m about to do with this project, you may think it deserves your attention.” And then he goes, “I’m afraid what you might find is a bunch of men in suits standing around an elephant.” And I said, “I was afraid you were gonna say that, but can you help me?” And he says, “Fly out and meet me.” And that’s where, that’s… GK: That’s where things get interesting. TD: This is where things get interesting. So I fly out… GK: I tell you what, Tom. We’re gonna take a break here in a minute. So you’re about to get into some really good stuff. We’re gonna save it to the other side. I should say that, without giving too much away, you and I had some conversations along the way too and I heard your pitch evolve and it got pretty good. After a while, you got pretty practiced at it. And maybe we’ll hear a little bit more about the pitch in the next segment, and then you can tell us about the general. Much more to come here on Coast to Coast AM. … Tom, before the break I mentioned that your pitch you were making to these folks as you move from one source to the next up the food chain, so to speak, your pitch gets better. And what is the basic message, what are you telling them that you can offer that hasn’t been offered to them before? TD: I think for the first time, somebody coming in that has a pretty serious academic background on the subject of the UFO phenomenon. Somebody that also has a recognizable name and a specific type of voice that speaks to a specific demographic. Also, somebody that comes in with a tremendous amount of respect and modesty when dealing with these guys, I’m not some kind of Hollywood prick. [chuckle] I’m treating the material the way it needs to be treated, at least with my first conversations with these guys. And then lastly, once they gave me a little bit, I executed exactly the way I said I would. And I think that kept building in their minds a great case to work with me. GK: So they dribbled something out to see how you’d handle it? TD: They did, they would dribble it out, and I would say… I would take it, I would incorporate it, I would make sure that I run everything by them, like I said that I would, I would tell them that when… I would say that, “We’re doing this piece of non-fiction. Here’s the first couple of chapters. Remember I told you I was doing that.” Or, “Here’s the novel, we talked about the novel, I want you to read the first part of the novel. Sir, is it okay if I do it this way, or this?” And it just kept going and going and going, and then I… Then what really I think clenched it was… Actually, I should back up here. When I got connected to the general that was a big, big breakthrough. And before I talk a little bit more about how I got, I got more trust from these guys. What happened was, is I was up at NASA Ames, I got connected to a very specific person and that person had me fly out and meet them. So this is where it gets really interesting. So I go out to a certain city and I land at the airport and I walk through security and I meet this person. The person takes me to a restaurant that’s right past security and I go to the back of the restaurant. There’s nobody in that area, and we sit at a booth for two hours and while we’re sitting there he leans across the table and this is the first, very first words that were said to me. “It was the Cold War, and every single day we lived under the threat of nuclear war, every single day, we believed and really thought in the deepest part of our souls, that nuclear war could happen at any given moment.” And then he stops and he goes, “And somewhere in those years,” and he looked me in the eye, he goes, “We found a life form. And everything that we did and every decision that we made with that life form was because of the consciousness at that time.” And I said, “Sir, when taking it into account things that this life form has done, for example, turning our nuclear weapons on and readying them for launch.” And then he interrupts me, puts a finger in my face and says, “There are heroes in Russia, heroes. And under grave risk to himself and to his country, they did not fire back.” And at that moment, I realized it had already started, this new game I was in of working with people in like a dance of words. And information was already coming, he… It was no… [chuckle] There was no small talk, we didn’t just sit down and just say, “Hey, let’s just have a beer and let’s get to know each other.” GK: So let’s jump back to that, let’s jump back to that conversation. It was the Cold War. TD: Right. GK: He’s given you sort of the setting for how the cover-up, or what we’d call the cover-up, began. TD: Yeah, so this is very important for people to remember, and this is where I’m so excited to start chopping down all these pathetic conspiracies that I was involved in as well. It was the Cold War. We really… He’s saying, that every day, they really thought about the annihilation of all mankind with these weapons that were hundreds or thousands of times bigger than what we dropped on Japan, and we had 20,000 each of those things. And all of a sudden something falls on their laps that’s just extraordinary. But even further than that, if you really hear what I’m saying about the nuclear weapons, the UFOs were turning our weapons on, just so Russia could pick up that we’re firing our missiles and fire their’s first, it was a big chess game. So these guys went into complete secrecy to start coming up with a defense system against this phenomenon. Now, I try to tell people some analogies on this. Imagine if someone from the CIA came to your house and sat on your couch and says, “Hey, I wanna tell you about that nuclear weapon that they tried to smuggle in through Canada two months ago. And I also wanna tell you about this virus that was almost got released in Los Angeles. And I wanna… ” All these… They’re not gonna do that, because they’re gonna be busy trying to figure out, find the people that did it or to seal off the borders or to come up with a game plan to get better defensive measures across our country, whatever they’re doing. That’s how this is, that’s how big this issue is. They’re not worried about if you and I totally understand, because they’re too busy trying to understand it and come up with a way to defend against it. And at the same time, they really want people to understand this, to know these things, but they don’t want it to mess up their efforts. The more that I started to find out, I thought it was a pretty heroic tale that these were really good men and women. Do you know that in that first conversation that I had with that general, during the two hours… I didn’t even leave the airport, I was in this back booth, and then I’d get led through security, get on a plane and go right back home. It was a crazy meeting. But during that he must have brought up what was “best for the republic, best for the free republic.” He brought that up probably eight different times. It’s very, very, very important to these men what is best for the United States as a free country, free-thinking men and the republic that we built. They’re not these crazies running around, trying to war… They’re not warmongers. Very smart. This person has multiple PhDs, and I wish I could tell you who he is and what… There was nobody above him. There’s nobody. Maybe a couple. But when you look at the divisions of how the Department of Defense works, in this specific division, it’s just extraordinary that I have this contact. So I started using that as much as I could. So I said, taking it from that point, we talked for two hours and I said, “Sir, I need an advisory committee,” and we walked through what I need and why. And so he went out and got the advisors for me. What got really… What was really interesting about this is that I started getting advisors that were in different areas, people that deal with space, people that deal with intelligence, people that deal with bio warfare, stuff that you wouldn’t necessarily think I should need, but I got them. And now I had the ability to start pulling these people together, and I had this one really interesting contact out in Washington, DC, that was connected to the highest levels of government. That’s how I can say it. And so I was able to pull off a coup in regards to what anybody in this field has ever been able to pull off, which was a conversation with not only my advisors, the most important group of the advisors, and somebody representing basically the highest levels of the land. And talking about how do we do something to help the youth understand that this is a reality. But they’re doing really good work and they could use the empowerment, they could use the citizens of the United States and the world understanding why it’s been kept secret, and that they’re not doing it out of malicious reasons. They’re doing it because it’s an ongoing task, it’s an ongoing issue, and they don’t fully understand it yet, but they’re trying their hardest and spending lots of money and have the brightest minds that they can find and they’re building things and they’re having breakthroughs that I think, frankly, we would all be incredibly proud of as a nation of what they’ve done. GK: Obviously, it’s a spin, they’re telling you a version that they want told, but it’s a story you wanted to tell. It’s part of your pitch to them is, “Look, you guys look bad, especially to young people who think there’s been a cover-up on this subject. People are demanding full disclosure, there’s a growing movement and a growing call for that. You guys painted yourself into a corner and it’s time to look for a way out. And this is one.” So, I mean, obviously you’re concerned that you’re being used, aren’t you? TD: Well, you know what, people have asked me that, and I’ll say no. And let me tell you why. Because I sought these people out and I asked them a very direct question and I get a very direct answer. There is no like, “Hey, why don’t you say this? Have you ever thought of this?” And just… I don’t get information for no reason at all. It’s a very formal approach, the way I do things. I’ll say, why has it been kept secret? I’ll say, in the book, the craft that our pilot character learns how to fly is a real craft. And so I’ll say, “Sir, I need guidance on the science of this,” and I will get that answer back. I never get information that I don’t specifically ask for. So, this whole project is not meant to sell people on the idea that this shit… Stuff’s real. Sorry for the bad word. Hopefully, we got that delay, so… I am still me, but I don’t go in here and I’m not trying to make this project convince people of the reality of the phenomenon. I’m doing a project to tell people the reasons it’s been kept secret and what has happened, what they’re dealing with, the breakthroughs that we had. And I think the specific things that I’ve always wanted to know, and if I think everybody learns these things, they’re gonna feel a hell of a lot more proud about our country, and about the Department of Defense, and what they’re doing. Because this one subject deals with religion, cosmology, physics, science, secrecy, the way we run our country, the relationships we have with other countries, relationships we have with other countries we’re not supposed to have relationships with but we actually kind of still do, because of this issue, and that’s just empowering, that’s really empowering to know for the whole next generation of people that are gonna grow up and take over all these countries when we’re all long gone. I think that this kind of subject can unify in so many areas beyond so many other subjects that are out there. GK: Did you get the sense that this group had ever met before, had sort of the gathering or the conference call, or was in regular communication? TD: The main, who I refer to as “the general”, I know has dealings with all these people, most of them, out of the 10, at certain times, some of them know, a few of them I got through different routes. The way I look at it, it’s interesting that when you look at the way the government is set up when it goes into subjects like this and you look at the way it’s managed, it makes perfect sense. So we all grew up in this topic thinking Majestic 12 and the secret shadow government. It’s not really like that. TD: Now, you have groups within the military that are doing R&D, that are coming up with and analyzing intelligence, so the National Reconnaissance Office will analyze the entire electromagnetic spectrum of space. And they will see things buzzing around and doing stuff, they take that down, then the Air Material Command will look at that stuff and say, “Okay, what do we build to defend against that?” And the research labs will say, “Okay well, this is how we’ll build it.” And then the CIA will have a bunch of guys that are just analyzing abduction reports or cattle mutilations or other things that are happening in the real world. And all these divisions are all doing their own stuff and there’s probably a very, very, very small group of people that are sitting at the top and putting it all together. I was told that, I said, I asked a very specific question, I was, “Sir,” this is exactly… It’s funny, ’cause I talk that way, I literally said that, I go, I go, “Sir, is there anybody standing back and looking at the big picture? You have abductions you have cattle mutilations, you have spacecraft zipping through orbits, you have these crashes, you have all these things.” And at one point, it was, “No, it’s a grab bag of scientists. Nobody is looking at the big picture,” which is really interesting to me, because I wonder if… And I don’t know all the answers yet, and I’m still taking my time asking the right questions, but it makes me almost feel like some crazy things happened back in the ’20s, ’30s and ’40s, and we put together a really strong effort to study the stuff, but I think that most of the stuff has been out of reach. So we don’t have some major MJ12 program per se, I think we have many programs that are dealing with different aspects of this when they happen, when a crash may happen. Let me tell you a conversation I had. So I flew out to Colorado Springs, which is where Air Force Space Command is, and also the Air Force Academy, and I was sitting at the desk of a very highly ranked person and then we brought in, this is one of my advisors, and then we brought in another advisor that was… I wish, I’m trying to figure out ways to tell you who these guys are, but of the highest rank again, and they said, “Well, what do you,” I said, “I’m gonna be talking about some crashes, the crashes in the ’40s.” There was a pause, and he says, “Why just the ’40s?” Gets you thinking a little bit. And then he said, “Well, what do you need? And I said, “Well, I think I need someone from the Defense Intelligence Agency.” And they say, “Why?” And I say, “Well, I don’t wanna make anyone angry, I’m not looking to piss anyone off, I’m not looking to ruffle feathers, break a story. I think if I do my project correctly it’ll do good.” And they take a pause and they’re looking at me and now I’m kinda going, “Well, what did I say wrong?” And one guy says, “Do you go ask your dad for permission after your mother already gave it to you?” And I said, “No, what do you mean?” And then he says, “You’ve been given permission, now shut the F up and get to work,” and he was very serious, and I had these two guys. Once again, you can count the stars on their shoulders, staring at me that I realize, “Oh my God,” that’s when I realize that two other people that I met that were working with me, who they really were, not just by their rank but who they really were in context to what the whole UFO subject is. So it’s an exciting place to be, but it is a little nerve-racking. [Author’s note: We have inquired with U.S. Space Command if Tom DeLonge had a meeting with the Command’s top leadership at the facility, but no records of correspondence or scheduling evidence exist to confirm this. This doesn’t necessarily mean it didn’t happen, but it is the response we have gotten to our basic inquiry at this point in time. On another note, Tom eventually got his advisor with a DIA background in the form of a man with a deep counter-intelligence background who supposedly ran the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (ATTIP) in secret for years within the Pentagon, Luis Elizondo. Elizondo, who is now a paid employee of To The Stars Academy and the star of Unidentified, says he resigned from his position out of respect for the Secretary of Defense and the institution in which he served for nearly two decades. He claims administrative hurdles made it impossible to convey critical info about UFOs to top rungs of Pentagon leadership and beyond, so he decided to pursue the topic outside of the Pentagon. His story does sound somewhat questionable and how he ended up with To The Stars Academy seems almost too convenient, so it is worth seeking further clarification. Some in the press are already aggressively challenging the veracity of his background , but as of now, Elizondo is more or less the face of To The Stars Academy’s most public efforts regarding UFO disclosure and he seems very knowledgeable on ATTIP’s past efforts.] Luis Elizondo., History Channel GK: We mentioned at the beginning about John Podesta. Now, you’ve interviewed Podesta. That’s public information that’s publicly known. I don’t know if you’re saying that he’s one of your advisors, but if so, that would be the only name that has been known. But I wanted to point out, as far as political and partisan connections, he would be the only one linked any candidate or office holder in your group, right? TD: John Podesta is in my documentary and my docuseries. I think that he’s… I think he’s somebody that everybody needs to watch, that’s all I’m gonna say. GK: And like I said before, I have in my mind, you said there’s no MJ12-type organization, I have in my mind a smoke-filled room, and it is like SPECTRE from the James Bond movie, but there’s, there’s no meetings. “Hey, everybody, let’s get together, you’re MJ1, you’re MJ2.” That doesn’t happen, it’s compartmentalization, which is pretty much what you’d expect to happen with a topic like this. TD: Right. And I’m not gonna say that I don’t know if there is a group of 12 guys, 10 guys, 20 guys that manage all of it, I haven’t asked that specific question yet. I’ve asked a lot of questions in the docuseries. You’re going to start to see all those, I’m gonna start presenting all that stuff and laying it out in chronological order, and people are gonna learn a hell of a lot. But I haven’t asked, “Is there a small group that manages this?”, other than what I told you a few minutes ago, where I said, “Is anybody standing back and looking at the big picture?” It seems to me that, you gotta look… You gotta think about this UFO phenomenon. GK: Hold on. Hold on a moment, Tom. That’s the foo fighters , that’s what people used to call UFOs, before they called them UFOs or UAPs, is foo fighters. Back with more of Tom DeLonge’s disclosures here, including some of the big picture stuff. Who are these visitors? Where are they from? What are they up to? Whatever he can tell us, coming up next on Coast to Coast. … Tom, as a guy who’s followed this topic for a long time, you know about disinformation. You know the history of the topic, how certain researchers have been led to believe that they’re about to get some real solid stuff. I think Linda Howe was promised some video of a landing. Robert Emenegger, his film project years ago, “We’re gonna give you the goods, the video of the landing, we’re gonna tell you the whole story.” You know about the disinformation in New Mexico and a lot of people don’t… Think that the MJ12 documents were created as part of a plot to confuse the Russians. How do you know you’re not being used or led down a path? TD: I think that’s a good question. Number one, these guys didn’t search me out. I haven’t had… In my advisory group, I haven’t had anybody that just came out of nowhere and says, “Hey, I really wanna give you something.” It didn’t work that way. It was through really interesting channels of how I met them. And some of which I have built relationships with… That are very close. And came from very, kind of… In very sanitized ways where I think people wouldn’t suspect that… They don’t have an interest in lying to me. They’re not… If I was working with a big group from… And intel from the CIA, I would be very wary of it. But all of my guys are, the channels that they work in, I should say guys and girls, but the places that they work and the divisions that they work in are more science-based, engineering-based and defense-based, and something else that I can’t say. But there are… GK: So they’re not necessarily professional spooks who deal with stirring the pot and misleading people? TD: Exactly. GK: You know they’re real, though? You’ve checked out their credentials. You know that they work in the places. TD: Oh, yeah, no, no, no. Oh, absolutely, ’cause I’ve been to the places and I’ve… I even attempted to read, [chuckle] I attempted to read something that one of these guys did and it was like 20 pages of equations that I’ve literally… You would think it’s a joke. There was somebody, he is a… He is what they did their… When you get your PhD you gotta do your, what do you call it? The dissertation or whatever it’s called. I don’t know what it’s called, but… It’s insanity, the level of how these guys operate. But I don’t wanna say they’re not in intelligence, it’s the type of, the intelligence arm that they’re in is not counter-intelligence based. It’s… I don’t wanna say what it is, but it’s space intelligence. GK: And what is the operating agreement? What agreement do you have with them? You don’t reveal their names or personal information about them? And do you have to clear the stuff that you release? TD: Absolutely, and I ask for permission. I’m not gonna say who they are, I’m not gonna ever put at risk anything that they… And also too, by the way, things they tell me that I have to release a certain way, respectfully, in drips, like I set up a bunch of parameters of how I will put the information into this project and how I will put it out there. So it does a couple of things: It doesn’t scare people, and it gets traction with young adults. That’s a very important point. GK: You know what you’re up against, though? People will say, “Well, look, this guy’s a rock musician. They’re not gonna tell this stuff to him, or they’re gonna tell him stuff that they have plausible deniability.” I mean, part of that is the appeal, right? That if they wanted to, if this goes wrong, they can discredit you or deny it. TD: Well, they can do that to anybody. I mean, they do that to Presidents. You’re talking about levels of power that we can’t comprehend as civilians. So I’m not… Frankly, I don’t care if anyone doesn’t believe me. I just, I’m in the middle of something very important. I just got to do what I said I’ll do, and I think if I do it right, it’s gonna have some really good effects and hopefully ignite other things that can happen within this discussion. But plausible deniability is something the government has always done and it’s the way they operate, especially when they want to put out very serious information. With this topic, what they’ve done is they would leak things over the past 60 years and create ridicule for the people that may believe it. That way, everyone kinda hears the stuff. You hear about the Roswell crash but you’re not really scared about it ’cause the chances are it might not be real, but maybe it could be real. But at this point… GK: Like Area 51, flying saucers out at the S4. TD: Yeah, exactly, it’s all that stuff they want you to know. The reason we talk about it, is because they chose for us to hear about it. And the reason we kinda laugh it off is because they, by design, that’s how they do it. But they want people to know. They don’t like the fact that they have to do all of this without people knowing how, what they’re doing and how hard they’re working at it. And I was… What I said to a few of them, I was like, “Do you know what this would do? It would change who we elect in office. It would change the amount of money we appropriate and allocate to these programs.” We have the biggest space program that we’ve ever had, thousands of times bigger than Apollo, and it would be part defense and it would be part exploration, and people would run to be a part of it and help. It’d be like the day after 9/11 where everyone wanted to sign up to the military. If people knew what the stakes were, if they just knew what these guys are telling me, and once people know this stuff and if it really caught fire and everyone knew that this was real, it would completely… It would change everything, it would just change everything. How we operate as a country, how we operate in partnership with other countries, and what our civilization is doing. Because don’t forget that, yes, we have cracked gravity. And yes, we are building machinery that have anti-gravity. And yes, I was told that. It’s a big deal. … As far as why was I given this, I touched on this a little bit earlier in the show, but it’s a super important question. Number one, I have access to these people because of what I do for a living, and as long as I don’t mention the whole UFO thing, I can pretty much meet whoever, but once I get in there, I’m very respectful, and I’m very passionate and I’m very knowledgeable about the subject. What you might not have heard earlier is that I presented a thesis that made its way through the DoD, that in turn got me a meeting with someone that was deep in intelligence out in Washington, DC. So it was that thesis and the academic nature of it, that got people interested in talking to me, not only because of who I was, but because I seem to have an elevated knowledge of the subject matter. And then after that, the main reason why they continue to work with me and really gathered around and supported the project is because I executed it in a way on many different things that are frankly pretty hard to do. And, over a year and a half, the way I’ve done that, releasing everything step by step and gathering all these different people from different places in the government and bringing them all together and holding very high-level meetings, very high-level meetings between Washington, DC and the people that I’m working with. I think all these things combined really created just a canvas for something new to happen. But I do understand it. I get that people are like, “Why you? You’re like, you play in a band? How did you do this?” Well, it’s a long… It’s kind of a long story, but that’s why the docuseries that will be coming out will be explaining this in more detail. End interview excerpt. You can listen to the entire interview here . Tom is clearly a highly creative, passionate, talented, and resourceful guy. It is remarkable what he has accomplished regardless of the circumstances and in so many ways many people who have had a high interest in this topic can’t help but root for To The Stars Academy’s success. At the same time, considering the incredible subject matter and Tom’s own words, we can’t be naive as to the other forces potentially at play when it comes to To The Stars Academy and the information and products it distributes. Doing so would be directly in opposition to what everyone’s goal should be—finding out the truth, regardless of if it fulfills personal wishes or reinforces long-standing beliefs. The U.S. government has a history of using the prominence of UFOs in popular culture and the media to their advantage and has even worked to perpetuate narratives about them that support its clandestine goals. This is not a rumor or a takeaway, it is a historical fact that can’t be denied . We aren’t going to dive deeply into all the potential reasons for the government to want to take a new approach when it comes to this topic, but they range from full-on disclosure and conditioning for that event to pushing misinformation to protect clandestine programs, regardless of their technological origin. As I have said many times before, the sky will look very different than it has in the past in the years and decades to come. Swarming drones , advanced unmanned combat air vehicles , hypersonic weapons , new low-observable aircraft designs , directed energy weapons of many types , the rapid militarization of space , and even active camouflage on advanced aircraft are just some of the things that will be present overhead in the not too distant future, if they are not already. In addition, the U.S. military and its contractor partners could have made major breakthroughs in exotic propulsion technologies within the deeply classified realm that would all but require a good cover story, at least for the time being. Just as during the height of the Cold War, being able to easily discount sightings of exotic flying machines and aerospace capabilities can be quite advantageous, and especially in an age when everyone has a high definition video camera in their pocket. Sadly, we are also now living in a time when great power competition is once again a very real thing. This means a burst in clandestine weapons research and development and the rapid fielding of new military capabilities. Also, just tying up a foreign power’s intelligence gathering resources by having them invest heavily into trying to discern if the U.S. has a new exotic weapons capability or if threats the U.S. armed services say exist and are out of its control are indeed real can be a highly advantageous strategic play. In other words, the possible reasons behind such a strange arrangement are many fold, and some of those reasons have nothing to do with actual mystery aircraft of an unknown origin gracing our skies. It’s also hard to imagine that the U.S. government’s most sensitive secrets would be turned over to a rock star with a high interest in the paranormal and history of making some pretty wild claims. Some of the most decorated and well resourced journalists on the planet have tried to penetrate the government veil on this issue, almost always ending up empty-handed or with more questions than they started with. At the same time, Tom’s story would indicate that brilliant minds from academia who have the most extensive educations possible on a myriad of topics that could be applied to this issue would have been passed over for Tom DeLonge’s business plan. In other words, it is really hard to understand how To The Stars Academy would be a better choice for this information than say Lincoln Labs, that is if we are to believe Tom’s story and his claims that the shadowy government figures that opened so many doors for him actually had genuine intent and that they more or less chose him for such a reality-changing task after hearing his pitch. Tom with his book Sekret Machines., Photo by Brandon Williams/Getty Images But then again, maybe that’s the whole idea. The information may have to live in a grey area of plausibility for a long period of time before people are conditioned to accept it as hard fact. At least that’s what many have theorized over the years. Tom even touts this in his own words when it comes to his proposed outfit’s ability to offer the government plausible deniability of the information it conveys. Maybe Tom’s plan did present a really unique, youthful, and relevant opportunity that aligned with the unspecified goals of those who control what the federal government actually knows about this topic. If such a group really exists, we also don’t know what internal dynamics may have been at play that could have prompted such monumental course change. Let me put this another way, explanations as to why powerful people with deep roots in the U.S. government’s national security apparatus helped Tom fulfill his vision could satisfy the most ardent UFO fanatic, just as they could satisfy the most hardline skeptic. It is literally a choose your own adventure novel in that regard, at least at this point in time. So, is Tom DeLonge a so-called ‘useful idiot’ in espionage parlance? Someone being used unwittingly via catering to their visions of grandeur and Hollywood tropes of cloak and dagger adventure. That would explain why his story of assembling his remarkable team seems to be a bit too convenient. Or is he shepherding in a new era that could end in fantastic realizations that could shake the very nature of our society and possibly even human consciousness? We are not capable of answering that question definitively at this time, but by Tom DeLonge’s own repeated admissions , it seems that the government is, or at least was, a key and even managing partner in his now very high-profile endeavor. If this isn’t actually the case, and Tom largely lied about how it all came to be, we really shouldn’t be buying much of what he or To The Stars Academy are peddling anyway. UPDATE: 6/12/2019— NASA has gotten back to us about DeLonge’s claims that he met with officials at NASA, and in particular at Ames Research Center.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the aftermath of the abortive attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in April 1980, the U.S. military dramatically overhauled and expand its special operations forces and their capabilities. Among other things, it touched off nearly 40 years of programs and initiatives seeking to develop a stealthy transport aircraft that could pierce through dense enemy air defenses and then be able to land and take off inside extremely confined spaces. The world changed yet again with the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. on Sept. 11, 2001. The Global War On Terror that followed required a monumental shift in Pentagon planning. Bolstered by large budget increases, the U.S. military’s new focus would be on rapidly confronting asymmetric actors and rogue states. Money poured into the special operations community to take on this new brace of threats, which included an intensified requirement to clandestinely gain access to the airspace of friendly and unfriendly countries alike. This was best exemplified by the rise of a penetrating and persisting stealth reconnaissance drone, the RQ-170 Sentinel , a craft with capabilities that had been sought after for decades and that would have been designed in part to work directly with any sort of stealthy special operations transport, feeding it surveillance in advance along the aircraft’s planned route and landing zone. There is abundant proof that the search for a stealthy special operations transport only intensified during this tumultuous decade, turbocharged by the new geopolitical realities around the globe and the tactical problems that the Pentagon was facing. In this the second installment of our two-part investigation into the shadowy world of stealthy special operations transport, the first part of which you can find here , we pick up where we left off, and explore how the requirements for such an aircraft continued to evolve through the 1990s, into the first decade of the new millennium, and all the way to the present. We also offer an in-depth analysis of whether these aircraft actually exist, perhaps operationally in small numbers, or even still in a largely experimental form. MC-X/Commando Spirit and M-X After spending more than two decades advancing the idea of a stealthy special operations transport aircraft largely in secret, in the late 1990s, the Air Force did initiate a number of more public projects regarding such a plane. In addition, the service began pursuing a number of advanced general-purpose designs, with more limited low-observable (stealth) features, as well as improved short and vertical takeoff and landing abilities. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), which had only become a major command in 1990, started a project that it referred to variously as Commando Spirit and MC-X . This project’s goal was to develop a smaller aircraft to replace its MC-130 types specifically in the special operations forces insertion and extraction roles. The existing C-130s would continue to perform complimentary special operations cargo-carrying missions in lower risk environments and fulfill air-to-air refueling requirements for special operations helicopters. The requirements the service laid out for Commando Spirit/MC-X described a smaller, stealthy aircraft and were virtually identical to those for the Special Operations Forces Transport Aircraft (SOFTA) – a payload capacity of around 4,000 pounds and a combat radius of more than 1,000 miles – an earlier program we at The War Zone discussed at length in part one of this investigation. But despite the clear relationship between the two efforts, McDonnell Douglas was in charge of the design study under the new program and completed its work, at least publically, in 1997. An extremely low-quality scan of McDonnell Douglas MC-X Commando Spirit concept art, showing what appears to be another rhombus-shaped stealth aircraft with individuals parachuting out of the rear. , McDonnell Douglas via USAF There were also discussions about whether the same general aircraft design might be able to accommodate some form of onboard weaponry, akin to an AC-130 gunship , or extensive electronic warfare capabilities, which could have enabled it to take on additional missions. The proposed armed version was reportedly referred to variously as Commando Dagger or MA-X. A more triangular looking MA-X Commando Dagger concept, that also appears to be firing a directed energy weapon ., McDonnell Douglas/USAF By 2003, with U.S. forces find themselves increasingly engaged in both Afghanistan and Iraq, Commando Spirit/MC-X had gotten renamed again, this time as the Advanced Special Operations Forces (SOF) Air Mobility Platform, or simply M-X. The parameters for a stealthy, short or vertical takeoff and landing capable aircraft smaller than a C-130 remained in place. The consultancy Jacobs Sverdrup Technology Inc. received a contract of unknown value to conduct the analysis of alternatives on M-X designs, completing that work in 2004. AFSOC formally approved the requirement in 2005, setting out a prospective initial operational capability date of 2018 for whatever final design the service settled on. The final study contained cost analyses for purchases of between 10 and 100 aircraft, with a projected service life of 20 years. McDonnell Douglas concept art of a stealthy tanker from the same general time frame as the MC-X and MA-X programs. This design concept could have also served as the basis for an MC-X type aircraft., McDonnell Douglas It remains unclear whether or not Air Force Special Operations Command ever acted on this requirement directly via any of these programs. AMC-X, Joint Heavy Lift, and ATT By 2007, the Air Force and the U.S. Army were looking at a mix of at least two new vertical- and short-takeoff and landing capable aircraft programs, known as the Advanced Mobility Concept (AMC-X) and Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) respectively. The latter of these efforts was primarily an Army initiative that eventually helped inform the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) and Future Vertical Lift (FVL) programs. The focus of JHL, and subsequently JMR and FVL, was on replacement rotorcraft for existing helicopters and, potentially, the V-22. AMC-X, on the other hand, ostensibly looked to pick up where the 1970s Advanced Medium Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) Transport program, or AMST , had left off. AMST had led to the Boeing YC-14 and McDonnell Douglas YC-15 , before the final product had morphed into the much larger Boeing C-17A Globemaster III many years later. The C-17 offered a blend of strategic and tactical airlift capabilities for more mainstream transport   applications. A C-17 Globemaster III touches down on an airstrip within the Nevada Test and Training Range during an exercise., USAF The new AMC-X was also supposed to act as a more direct follow-on for a separate 1990s program called the Advanced Theater Transport (ATT). This latter project had sought to create a C-130-sized airlifter with extreme short-takeoff and landing capabilities. As with SOFTA and MC-X, the Air Force wanted the ATT to have a combat radius of more than 1,000 miles and expected the plane to fly a high-low-low-high flight profile to its destination and back. The proposed aircraft would have an exponentially greater load capacity than the notional planes in the earlier programs, though, at between 30 to 40 tons. With a 30 ton payload, the aircraft would have to be able to take off and land within a distance of just 750 feet. Boeing and Lockheed Martin developed concepts for the ATT. Boeing, having acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997, proposed a tailless, tilting-wing derivative of the C-17 with four turboprop engines, nicknamed the Super Frog . Concept art of Boeing’s Super Frog., Boeing Lockheed Martin’s proposal was a stealthier hybrid or blended wing body design. This planform offers advantages in aerodynamic efficiency, which in turn improves fuel economy, as well as greater internal capacity in its wings for fuel. Clearly, the company’s ATT concept was also designed with stealth capability as a driving factor, when Boeing’s very much wasn’t. A three-dimensional rendering of Lockheed Martin’s ATT concept, which evolved into its AMC-X/AJACS proposal., Lockheed Martin Not long after it first emerged to the public in 2007, AMC-X experienced yet another name change, becoming the Advanced Joint Air Combat System (AJACS). As of March of that year, Alenia North America, Lockheed Martin, Piasecki Aircraft, and Voyager Aerospace had all indicated their intent to submit proposals. Alenia North America was, at the time, competing for the Army-Air Force Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) light intra-theater airlifter program with its C-27J Spartan . Piasecki aircraft had been working with the Army and the Navy on high-speed compound helicopters . Voyager Aerospace was a particularly interesting entrant in the context of the larger discussion about stealthy and short takeoff and landing capable transports. At the time, founder Dick Rutan, brother of Scaled Composites’ Burt Rutan, said the two of them had been working on an applicable twin-engine cargo aircraft design for more than 15 years, but offered no details, according to Flight magazine . In 2007, this would have meant their supposed ongoing project began around 1992. This lines up with the time period shortly after Burt had submitted his proposals for the SOFTA program and right before the Senior Citizen special access program came to an end, both of which we covered in the first installment of this story. Lockheed Martin’s ATT and AMC-X/AJACS proposals are similar in some respects to this 1992 North American Aircraft concept art of a special operations transport. However, this one features wing-mounted lift fans for vertical takeoff and landing that is more closely associated with the SOFA and Senior Citizen programs. North American supposedly crafted this notional design as part of a study for the USAF into ejection seats and other crew escape technologies, but it very well could have come from a defunct program., USAF The AMC-X/AJACS program did not have a clear requirement for a reduced radar cross-section. At the same time, Lockheed Martin’s submission, which was of the same general configuration as its proposal for the preceding ATT project, makes it clear that there was no prohibition against including stealth features. It is very likely that the Air Force left the requirements relatively vague and asked potential manufacturers to propose a design that they thought would be best suited to accomplishing the necessary mission sets. This is something we have seen in more recent U.S. military research and development efforts . We do know that some senior Defense Department officials at the time publicly held the view that it wasn’t a necessity for future transport aircraft to be stealthy. “Low observable characteristics [stealth] are a useful attribute for aircraft supporting special operations forces, but are less likely to be of critical importance for other aerial maneuver operations since non-low observable aircraft can operate at altitudes above shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons, and suppression of enemy air defenses is assumed for more sophisticated systems,” a 2007 Defense Science Board report on vertical and short takeoff and landing capable aircraft said. This has turned out to be a glaringly short-sighted assessment . Within a handful of years, anti-access and area-denial enemy strategies and the proliferation of very capable integrated air defense systems would become the primary focus of the Pentagon when it comes to preparing to fight future conflicts. There is also always the possibility this public position may have been deliberate disinformation. Beyond that, relying on the suppression of enemy air defenses to clear a path to the objective would ruin the element of surprise that stealth transport aircraft would afford and the deniability of a clandestine insertion or extraction, which had and continues to be one of the core mission sets for a low-observable transport. Regardless, while some elements of the U.S. military weren’t entirely convinced that stealthy features would be compatible with the AMC-X/AJACS aircraft, the Air Force was certainly looking to reduce the signatures of its future transport aircraft. “The Air Force is also looking for ‘balanced survivablility’ against an array of sensors – ‘infrared, radio-frequency, and human’,” FlightGlobal reported at the time, citing Carl Zuene of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Speed Agile In 2007, Carl Zuene was the manager for another program called Speed Agile. This project was originally billed as supporting AJACS with low- and high-speed wind tunnel testing of the concept designs. Lockheed Martin and Boeing subsequently received contracts to build scale models of their proposed aircraft. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was also involved in this project. A Speed Agile wind tunnel test model., USAF Speed Agile ended up subsuming AJACS, which had hoped to produce a flying prototype by 2015. Here’s how the Air Force described what had become known as the Speed Agile Concept Demonstrator (SACD) in 2011: “The Speed Agile Concept Demonstrator (SACD) concept is a four-engine, multi-mission aircraft that offers speed agility; operates routinely from short, improvised airfields; carries larger and heavier payloads; and employs precise and simple flight controls. The SACD’s high-efficiency STOL design incorporates a hybrid powered lift system. This lift system features a simplified mechanical design and low-drag integration. Together, these features greatly reduce both the vehicle weight and overall drag on the vehicle, resulting in greater efficiency and payload capacity than conventional powered lift systems. An aircraft employing Speed Agile technology could potentially operate from short, unprepared airfields. These benefits, coupled with the overall vehicle efficiency, could result in an extremely versatile aircraft capable of quickly and safely transporting equipment, supplies, and troops to remote areas.” The models that Lockheed Martin and Boeing crafted were not entirely optimized for stealth, but did feature hybrid and blended wing body planforms that offered a reduced radar cross-section and some designs clearly had stealthy features. Speed Agile also leveraged separate work the Air Force and Lockheed Martin had done on developing advanced manufacturing processes for large composite material structures, such as the ones employed on stealth aircraft. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced design bureau needed only 20 months to build the experimental X-55A Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft (ACCA) and put it into the air for its first flight. The company’s pioneering research for the Air Force, which you can read about in more detail here , would also have informed the company’s own submissions for programs such as Speed Agile. Lockheed Martin’s experimental X-55A ACCA, derived from the Dornier 328JET design., Lockheed Martin Since 2011, Lockheed Martin has used designs related to their Speed Agile proposals as the basis for stealthy aerial refueling tanker concepts, which are still under development . It is possible that such a plane with generous payload capacity could be configured to perform various other combat support mission sets , including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and electronic warfare support. As of January 2019, there is no indication that Speed Agile has either come to an end or produced a flying prototype. Lockheed Martin has said in the past that it hopes to flight test one of its blended or hybrid wing body designs in the 2020s, although this could be under a separate initiative altogether . A model of a Lockheed Martin advanced aerial refueling tanker concept with a hybrid wing body planform. The company says it could adapt this design to meet the needs of special operations forces if necessary., Joseph Trevithick Project IX In parallel to Speed Agile, AFSOC secretly developed requirements for C-130-sized aircraft as part of what it called Project IX, also sometimes written as Project 9. In a redacted 2009 concept of operations (CONOP), which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the command describes the desired aircraft as such: “The Project IX is a high-speed, medium-lift, long-range, short takeoff and landing (STOL), low observable (LO) platform to conduct special operations forces (SOF) mobility missions which exceed the capability of current SOF mobility platforms. Project IX will provide the capability to perform clandestine penetration into politically or militarily denied areas in two distinct mission areas: Strategic Special Operations and Supporting Joint Air/Joint SOF Missions in Denied Access Areas. … “The Project IX will provide significantly better aircraft performance than current AFSOC mobility platforms, including the C-130J , entail a smaller crew, require less logistical support, be able to operate from smaller, more austere airfields/locations, and provide significant interoperability improvements with other aircraft and command and control (C2) organizations. The Project IX will be reliable, survivable and able to conduct strategic clandestine SOF mobility infil/exfil/resupply in current and future denied access environments. … “Project IX supportability will initially rely heavily on contractor logistic support (CLS) because of the unique characteristics of the LO technologies. Service support, in terms of basing and security, will also be critical to transitioning Project IX from an advanced capability technology demonstrator (ACTD) program to a fully operational asset. There are lessons learned and precedents for such responsibility regarding other specialized aircraft ( F-117 , B-2 , F-22 , etc.), and Project IX will take full advantage of them.” A number of general Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) requirements informed the Project IX CONOP. The document also specifically makes reference to the aircraft outlined under the early 2000s’ M-X program and Air Force censors redacted another related CONOP in its entirety. It’s worth noting that the author’s inquiries to various public affairs offices and subsequent FOIA requests have yet to turn up evidence of any projects numbered one through eight. The requirements for Project IX call for efforts to reduce the aircraft’s radar cross-section, as well as infrared, acoustic, and radio frequency signatures. “Regardless of altitude and the LO [low obsevable] and EW [electronic warfare] technologies incorporated into Project IX, visual and electronic detection of the aircraft may still be possible,” the CONOP warned. Since it used the M-X concept as a baseline, Project IX’s desired combat radius was again set at more than 1,000 miles. The total required distance to take off or land was to be less than or equal to 1,500 feet. Any specific payload information that might have been present in the CONOP is redacted. CONOPs that AFSOC identified as being related to Project IX’s requirements, including one that is entirely redacted., USAF via FOIA Not surprisingly, Project IX called for an aircraft with extensive communications capabilities and advanced electro-optical and infrared sensors to help with low-level flight and maneuvering on the ground, day-or-night, at austere locations. Particularly interesting was a desire for an electronic warfare system that could detect and classify threats in the air and on the ground and then instruct the aircraft to automatically make adjustments in the route to the target area to optimize survivability. The crew would have the option of disabling the system’s automated functions “based upon the threat/mission circumstances.” “The EW [electronic warfare] suite should maximize receive only options from national intelligence sources to prevent compromise should aircraft be commandeered, while reducing weight and space,” the CONOP noted, as well. This mix of stealth technology, electronic warfare countermeasures, and nap-of-the-earth flight capability would be essential for penetrating into a modern denied area deep inside an opponent’s home turf. Even the most specially configured MC-130 would almost certainly be far too vulnerable to operate in this kind of extremely high-risk environment. The status of Project IX is unknown, but in 2010, Michael Vickers , then-Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a retired Army Special Forces soldier who had also previously been a paramilitary operations officer in the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) Special Activities Division (SAD), seemed to allude to the program publicly . AFSOC’s stated goal was to field the aircraft sometime between 2019 and 2025 and this is a schedule the Air Force could still very well be intent on keeping. An “Operational View,” or OV, showing how the Project IX aircraft might fit into a broader concept of operations involving clandestine special operations forces activities., USAF via FOIA Project IX in interesting because it seems like a realistic and detailed rationalization of decades of concepts that appear to have come and gone. In some ways, by the late 2000s, technology had also caught up with the tactical special operations concept to some degree, especially in terms of off-the-shelf subsystems, composite material science and manufacturing , and low-observable (stealth) design and applications. It stands as neither the most ambitious special operations low observable airlifter program nor the least, also making its feasibility much more probable. Making the most out of what you already have In 2013, AFSOC initiated what appears to be the most recent effort to investigate the possibility of developing an enhanced, short takeoff and landing capable transport capability that featured some signature reduction measures. The project, however, was far less ambitious than any of its predecessors, according to various additional documents the author has obtained via FOIA. Known as Project 10, an apparent reference to having a relation to Project IX, the initiative primarily explored a raft of already available and potential upgrades for the C-130 aircraft. AFSOC did say that a second phase of the new project could “reenergize [the] SOF R&D [research and development] Community for next gen SOF mobility platform,” according to one January 2013 briefing, which name-checked a host of previous programs, including Credible Sport , MC-X, Speed Agile, and Project IX. Project 10 was also known by the nicknames New Magic and Super Sport, the latter being a direct reference to Credible Sport. AFSOC described the proposed final product as the Low Signature Mobility Aircraft, as well. An April 2013 Capabilities Development Document (CDD) for the “Super Sport” outlines the basic need for such an aircraft as such: “It is the nature of special operations that missions will be conducted against high-value, politically sensitive targets of critical importance to the nation. There will be occasions where these targets are located deep inside denied/sensitive territory and do not possess a landing zone suitable for current MC-130 aircraft. For these occasions, a Super Sport version of the MC-130 must be able to INFIL/EXFIL a special operations team and their equipment in the shortest time frame possible to conduct national-level, strategic missions. To meet dynamic mission requirements, the MC-130 Super Sport aircraft could be configured with the specialized equipment required to perform the majority of its MC-130 SOF Mobility missions to include airdrop/airland resupply, FARP [Forward Arming and Refueling Point], and MISO [Military Information Support Operations; also known as Psychological Operations ]. “These Super Sport operations will be planned and conducted to very short landing zones in all environments to include high density altitude (i.e., high pressure altitude, high ambient temperature) with long-range insertion (with or without inflight refueling) direct from home station. In other situations, MC-130 Super Sport aircraft could self-deploy with a logistics support package to an interim staging base or a remote, sparsely equipped forward base. Support personnel would rapidly configure and equip the aircraft for its Super Sport configuration and aircrews could execute missions in minimal time with little external support.” In the first real divergence from what was then three decades of increasingly firm requirements, Project 10 called for a plane capable of flying high-low-low-high mission profile across a combat radius of fewer than 520 miles – 450 nautical miles – with a payload of no more than 10 tons. The aircraft had to be able to take off and land within 2,000 feet. A notional Super Sport mission profile., USAF via FOIA The goal was to outline the modifications necessary to a MC-130H or J aircraft that would meet AFSOC’s needs and still be able to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) with within 30 months of issuing a contract. The Air Force defined IOC in this case as having three modified aircraft and five fully-trained aircrews, together with either an organic or contractor-operated support chain. The full fleet would consist of approximately 10 aircraft. The possible Project 10 upgrades ranged from modifications to specific components to entire upgrade packages from Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and smaller firm Snow Aviation. AFSOC broke these options down into three categories: “low hanging fruit,” “more complex” upgrades, and “Far Term/Expensive” proposals. The first category included adding microvanes to various portions of the aircraft to improve airflow, installing eight-bladed Hamilton Sundstrand NP2000 propellers on all four engines, digital engine control systems for greater efficiency, a Lift Distribution Control System (LDCS), and simple weight reduction. A detailed description of the LDCS in documents obtained through FOIA is entirely redacted, but it reportedly offered improved fuel efficiency, greater payload capability, and long wing life all by itself. The microvanes offered greater fuel efficiency, as well as acoustic signature reduction . The NP2000 propellers were the only individual proposal of any kind to offer fuel savings, improved flight and short takeoff and landing performance, increased reliability and reduced maintenance demands, as well as a reduced acoustic signature. Coupled with the engine modifications, these benefits only increased. The Air Force has considered adding these updates to standard C-130 airlifters, which you can read about in more detail here , but had still not moved ahead with the program in earnest as of January 2018. A C-130H aircraft with the NP2000 propellers, as well as other internal engine-related upgrades. This particular aircraft also has the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System II ( MAFFS II ) system installed., USAF AFSOC’s “low hanging fruit” category also included a modest upgrade package proposal from Lockheed Martin. This consisted of an engine upgrade with a new control system for optimal performance, improved flaps for added lift, and “speed break spoilers” to rapidly slow and stop the plane during landings. Available for the newer MC-130J Commando II only, this would give the aircraft the ability to takeoff within 1,400 feet and land inside 1,200 feet at sites at altitudes up to 4,000 feet and with a total aircraft gross weight of 110,200 pounds. A standard C-130J airlifter has a maximum takeoff weight of 155,000 pounds. Options such as winglets, a system to blow compressed air over the wing surfaces to improve lift, extra internal fuel, and infrared, acoustic, and visual signature reductions were in the mid-tier category. There was also a second level of upgrade package from Lockheed Martin, which added further improved engines and flaps, and new propellers, which could work with either the MC-130H or MC-130J. The winglets offered better fuel economy and improved short takeoff and landing performance. The Air Force has since tested the winglets on MC-130Js and standard C-130Js to further investigate the potential fuel savings, but has yet to make them a standard feature in either fleet. An MC-130J with the winglets., USAF The descriptions of the added fuel capacity are redacted entirely. The slide on the blown air system notes that the Japanese ShinMaywa US-2 four-engine amphibian has this feature and that the technology is well established, but that it’s unclear how much it might cost to integrate onto an MC-130. The options to reduce the infrared signature are the most rudimentary, consisting of exhaust diverters and heat sinks. AFSOC also noted potential options to reduce propeller noise, engine vibration, and dampen the sound of the aircraft simply moving through the air, all of which would make it harder for an opponent to hear it coming, especially at night. The visual signature reduction possibilities are especially fascinating. Project 10 noted advances in active camouflage, carbon nanotubes , and metamaterials , all of which could break up the outline of the aircraft or change its appearance in the visual light spectrum, making it difficult to identify, especially at extended ranges. Lastly, there was a proposal to use what are known as femtosecond lasers , which emit pulses of amplified light at extremely high speeds, to absorb visible light hitting the aircraft’s skin. A low-quality scan of a briefing slide discussing possible visual signature reduction options for AFSOC MC-130s., USAF via FOIA If these proposals worked, it could’ve allowed for the aircraft to have more options for operating in the daytime. The briefing specifically cites “lots of unsubstantiated claims on the internet, higher risk” as “cons” for these concepts, though. This is somewhat humorous, but it also seems indicative of just how unsubstantiated these applications were at the time of publishing. The final collection of options under Project 10 consisted of major upgrade packages from Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Snow Aviation, as well as the possibility of adding stealthy features to the MC-130s. Northrop Grumman’s “C-130M” concept was listed as “Competition Sensitive” and censors blacked it out completely. Lockheed Martin’s third tier upgrade and Snow Aviation’s plan both involved major modifications to the aircraft’s fuselage, wings, tail, and other surfaces, primarily to improve short takeoff and landing capability. Snow Aviation’s proposal also had a significant increased fuel capacity, in both new internal and wingtip tanks, for greater range. In addition, it featured employed the NP2000 propeller, giving it the acoustic signature reduction benefit. Snow Aviation’s ex-US Air Force WC-130E Hercules, which served as a test bed for the company’s modifications. , via c-130.net As noted, some of these modifications have worked their way into the Air Force’s general modernization plans for the C-130. So far, there isn’t any indication that AFSOC has proceeded in any significant way with the plans it outlined in Project 10. “At this time, AFSOC is not actively engaged in development of new requirements for a short takeoff and landing variant of the MC-130,” a public affairs officer for the command told the author in 2015. “The last analysis was completed in April 2013, and the documents were never validated as formal AFSOC requirements.” In 2013, the Project 10 managers had recommended exploring some of the smaller upgrades, such as the NP2000 propellers and microvanes, in the near term. “Commission ‘Stealth Mobility Study’ to determine next steps,” was their final suggestion. Project 10’s recommendations as of January 2013., USAF via FOIA Overall, Project 10’s near-term goals seem to be a logical path toward getting the most out of the C-130 for low and medium threat missions. Such an aircraft could even assist a Project IX aircraft stage at remote locales along the edges of highly contested territory. So with Project IX and Project 10, we are talking about two disparate capabilities and mission sets that are more complimentary of each other than anything else. Additional evidence? With such persistent, stable requirements, spanning four decades and at least a dozen known, named programs, and more we surely still don’t know of, it is hard to imagine that one or more them did not actually produce flying prototypes or even an operational capability. The alternative is that the U.S. military, and the Air Force, in particular, has run all of these projects and design studies on various assault transport aircraft with vertical and/or short takeoff and landing capabilities and stealthy features for nearly 40 years, at the cost of many millions of dollars at least, without any tangible results whatsoever. If indeed this is the case, a seemingly large and very well identified capability gap has remained unfulfilled. There have also been repeated reports and alleged sightings of aircraft that fit the description of an advanced, stealthy transport plane, including the various claims about the Senior Citizen program. The existence of such an aircraft could also offer an explanation for the sightings of the so-called “ flying Doritos ” in the skies over Texas in 2014. We have also received a number of tips about stealth transport aircraft of a particular description working in the Arctic region for some time now, and that is not counting all the other reported sightings of advanced aircraft over the previous three-plus decades. Continued technological developments in stealth and vertical and short takeoff and landing capabilities didn’t come to a halt, either. Lockheed Martin’s Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Advanced Reconnaissance Insertion Organic Unmanned System program, or VARIOUS , among many others, shows that companies are still leveraging their past work and publicly applying it to contemporary concepts. The F-35B alone is a remarkable showcase of operational STOVL technology and its powerplant components alone could be a springboard for stealthy special operations transport capabilities. Concept art for Lockheed Martin’s VARIOUS unmanned aircraft looks more than a little similar to concepts it crafted for the SOFA program in the 1980s and 1990s., Lockheed Martin On top of that, there is a significant amount of tertiary information that suggests this capability is available, at least in small numbers or in a quasi-experimental state. The biggest indicator is the proven existence of a far less capable, but still stealthy vertical takeoff and landing capable special operations transport aircraft. The aircraft in question are the Stealth Black Hawks that SOCOM employed during the raid on Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 2, 2011. These aircraft represent a more survivable counterpart to other special operations rotorcraft, such as the Army’s MH-60M Black Hawks . The MH-60M, and earlier special operations specific MH-60s, themselves reflect a lower tier of a more conventional clandestine insertion and extraction capability. Even if the Stealth Hawks only existed in tiny numbers and even in an experimental form, they did indeed exist even though there was far less proof – as in next to none – of such a concept being realized compared to a stealth fixed-wing tactical transport. Then there is the V-22 Osprey, which gave special operations forces a revolutionary platform that allows them to rapidly deploy over longer ranges than a standard helicopter, but without giving up the ability to infiltrate and exfiltrate vertically into constrained areas. Air Force Special Operations Command’s CV-22B Ospreys possess the speed, range, electronic warfare and self-protection defenses, situational awareness and communications capabilities, and nap-of-the-earth flight abilities that collectively allow it to penetrate some enemy defenses in order to carry out risky special operations missions. In fact, for shorter-range missions with more limited payloads, this aircraft addressed many of the operational needs that the Credible Sport C-130 had sought to fill back in the early 1980s . But the Osprey is not a low-observable asset by any means and it still has limited unrefueled range. In this day and age of anti-access tactics and dense integrated air defenses, the CV-22B would be hard pressed to carry out deep insertion and extraction of special operations forces in high-risk, anti-access environments and especially against peer state foes. Doing anything like this clandestinely, without relying on nearby support assets, would be all but impossible even according to the Pentagon’s own decades-old white paper that we discussed earlier. Well before the V-22 was even in service, the Air Force was already of the view that the Osprey would not obviate the requirement for a separate stealth special operations platform to operate over long-ranges in higher risk environments. “The V-22 can only be utilized in [a] low intensity environment and does not meet the postulated range requirements,” according to a 1987 memo from Air Force’s Aerospace Sustainment Directorate, then part of Air Force Materiel Command, which Reddit user u/aclockworkgreen1 posted online in 2014. “All indications are that the V-22 will not, in fact, fulfill the requirements for stealth and range.” At that time, the Air Force warned that if other services, such as the Army and the Navy, abandoned the V-22, it might similarly withdraw from the program. In that case, the proposed course of action was to “take the lead in the mid 1990s with a more capable aircraft.” A US Air Force CV-22B Osprey in action., USAF Further evidence that some sort of a stealthy special operations transport exists is out there, as well. Journalist and author Sean Naylor’s Relentless Strike : The Secret History Of Joint Special Operations Command mentions that in 2011 the raiding force considered parachuting into Osama Bin Laden’s compound, but does not say how a transport aircraft would have been able to successfully deliver the force to the drop zone. ​ ​​​ The employment of the Stealth Hawks initially indicated that there were major concerns about the Pakistani military detecting the infiltrating aircraft and engaging them or Al Qaeda sympathizers within Pakistan’s security forces taking any information provided to the government in advance of the raid and alerting Bin Laden. We now know that this was all true and more. There was a high probability that if an aircraft was detected, Pakistan’s Air Force, that sits on high alert due to tensions with India, would have tried to shoot it down. At the very least, such a situation would have ended in an aerial standoff between U.S. and Pakistani fighters. With all this in mind, flying a lumbering MC-130 or CV-22s nearly over the major Pakistani military base in Abbottabad seems extremely unlikely as far as options go. Powered parachutes , wingsuits , and high-altitude high-opening parachuting techniques may have enabled a stand-off insertion from a non-stealthy platform, but they would have still required a cargo plane to fly deep into highly monitored Pakistani airspace at higher altitudes where they are extremely vulnerable to detection. Then there is the whole issue with how do you get the teams out without accepting too much up-front risk if they were to parachute in from an asset that couldn’t also recover them. During the raid, the special operations MH-47 Chinooks didn’t push into the target area until the very end of the operation as part of a contingency plan should a Stealth Hawk crash, which one did. If that aircraft hadn’t gone down, the Stealth Hawks would have exfiltrated the teams and we would never have known a stealthy Black Hawk variant even exists. MH-47 special operations Chinook like the ones used during the raid on Bin Laden’s compound in 2011. They worked as contingency extraction assets and to set up forward refueling points to gas up the Stealth Hawks on their way out of Pakistan. , DoD In the end, U.S. Navy Admiral William McRaven, then head Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) reportedly axed the plan, but only apparently because of the danger of the SEALs getting their parachutes tangled in power and phone lines in the area, according to Naylor’s book . So once again, the big question here is what platform was really being considered for this option? With what we know, a non-stealthy one seems unlikely. The existence of the RQ-170 Sentinel penetrating surveillance drone mentioned at the start of this piece is also an interesting example to comprehend. It is another capability requirement that emerged in the early 1980s, in its case in the form of Northrop’s Tacit Blue , but remained unsatisfied, at least publically in an operational state, until the appearance of the RQ-170 at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan back in 2007. You can read all about the RQ-170’s direct lineage to Tacit Blue here , but suffice it to say that if it took nearly 30 years and many steps to realize that game-changing capability set, there is nothing to say that the same wasn’t true of for a stealthy special operations tactical transport. Maybe the most interesting potential tell that at least some type of highly secretive special operations transport exists is the fact that those that are tasked with the aerial refueling of special operations aircraft on the most complex missions they execute cannot speak of every type of aircraft they work with. All the other known types in the U.S. military’s inventory that would require the aerial refueler’s unique skills seem to be accounted for, but there are still “others” that remain undisclosed and that individuals associated with the Special Operations Aerial Refueling program cannot discuss. We also know that elements of the tanker community have provided gas to secret exotic aircraft operating over war zones and over the U.S. from time to time. Who would fly them? In the black world of super-secret U.S. military aviation units, which we at The War Zone have previously examined in detail based on what information is publicly available, there are prime candidates for who might operate such an aircraft. The Air Force’s 66th Air Operations Squadron, about which virtually nothing is known, is often simply said to fly C-130s . A 66th Air Operations Squadron patch with various references to Area 51., USAF Another secretive unit, the 427th Special Operations Squadron , appears to own the covert and clandestine infiltration and exfiltration mission in low-threat environments, using a fleet of civilian-styled turboprop light utility and small transport aircraft . The Army’s Flight Concepts Division (FCD), now known as the Aviation Technology Office (ATO), could also operate the stealth aircraft. This unit, by most accounts, was also the unit in charge of the Stealth Hawks. Before the Bin Laden raid, FCD/ATO already had a long history conducting clandestine missions and working with the most elite of America’s special operations forces, as well as the CIA. Though typically associated with helicopters , this organization has reportedly acquired a number of C-27Js , an aircraft that sits between the CV-22 and the C-130 in terms of payload, range, and STOL capabilities. The Air Force mothballed these aircraft in 2012, the result of an entirely separate saga , and subsequently began divesting them to other U.S. government entities, including the Army. We know that the U.S. Army Special Operations Command’s (USASOC) Flight Battalion has acquired some of them. This unit is ostensibly a training and non-combat support unit that provides organic airlift and airdrop capabilities during drills, including Robin Sage , the capstone exercise for candidates hoping to become Army Special Forces soldiers. The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) may also have some for research and development activities. This office is responsible for various advanced, but generally public Army aviation research and development efforts. A US Army C-27J Spartan., US Army But it is possible that the AATD may share its fleet to some degree with that of the top-secret FCD/ATO. Both organizations are situated at Felker Army Airfield at Fort Eustis, Virginia , but the latter operates under extremely tight security out of a highly secure hangar at the airfield. FCD/ATO is slated to get a new, larger hangar, as well as associated facilities, in a remote area near the airfield in the coming years. Concept art and dimensional diagrams both feature the C-27J prominently, reinforcing the significance of those aircraft, and/or ones of similar size, to the unit’s operations. Art showing the Aviation Technology Office’s future hangar complex at Felker Army Airfield with C-27Js prominently featured., USACE A diagram from a 2016 environmental assessment regarding the new Aviation Technology Office facilities, also featuring a C-27J as a typical aircraft for determining safety considerations., USAF The Spartans may serve as a cover and training surrogate for a similarly sized clandestine transport aircraft. There is definitely a precedent for this, with the Air Force using A-7 Corsair II combat jets and T-38 Talon jet trainers to help hide the F-117 stealth combat jet program during the 1980s. It is even possible that a C-27J-sized stealth transport aircraft resides under the FCD/ATO’s purview and a C-130-sized stealth aircraft does the same under the control of the 66th. This would again reflect the multiple tiers of capabilities that the Pentagon has been describing in its stealthy transport requirements for years now. Both of these units also work closely together in general under the broader umbrella of Joint Special Operations Command’s Aviation Tactics Evaluation Group (AVTEG). The parent services might have limited knowledge and control over any stealth transports that might exist assigned to units under the AVTEG umbrella, further obfuscating the true “owner” of these planes. We know that there are still units assigned or attached to JSOC the existence of which remains classified. This portion of the Table of Contents from JSOC’s 2011 Annual History Report shows the existence of a number of units assigned or attached to the command remains classified. AVTEG is notably absent among the unredacted units on this list, as well., SOCOM via FOIA A stealth transport program could very well be an interagency affair, as well. The CIA, in particular, has a long-standing relationship with advanced and novel aircraft programs and has a regular need for covert and clandestine means of inserting and extracting personnel in denied areas. There is also a history of the Agency working with the U.S. military, directly or indirectly , and taking part in top-secret interagency operations that might require this kind of stealthy transport capability. Operators from the CIA’s Special Activities Division were notably involved in the Bin Laden raid, for instance. If the aircraft only exist in tiny numbers and in experimental form, then it may be the case that no unit formally flies them in an operational capacity, at least not outside of unique circumstances. So, where are they? If any of these planes do indeed exist, where is the U.S. military, or its interagency partners, keeping them? An advanced special operations transport in the C-27 size class, a fleet of which would likely exist only in small numbers if they do indeed exist, would be relatively easy to conceal without the need for large specialized hangars and associated facilities that would stand out and draw attention. A small fleet of C-130-sized planes would be more difficult to keep hidden from the public eye based on already available facilities. The secretive Tonopah Test Range (TTR) Airport would be one ideal home for these aircraft. AFSOC and the special operations community, in general, have been active at the field over the last decade and has used it to carry out key tests and training. Area 51 and a small handful of other secret test sites would also be possibilities, but only if the aircraft are still in testing in tiny numbers. The U.S. military might look to utilize more public bases, but only in remote areas, such as Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska or Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico for operational home-basing. It’s important to note that if the fleet of these aircraft is truly minuscule in size, and it likely is, with a dozen or less airframes on hand, the majority of these aircraft would likely spend much of their lives forward deployed to major hotspots. Keeping a couple airframes stationed in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific region, near foes such as Russia, Iran, North Korea , and even China, would require a standing training cadre of just a couple airframes back home in the United States for training and tactics development. If this is the case, even a C-130 sized stealth transport would be quite easy to hide at a variety of locations, with the aircraft only venturing out at night for training and actual operations. If the airframe doesn’t even require a long runway, the potential basing locations increase dramatically as well. There is also, of course, the possibility that the U.S. military continues to lack this capability in any form. “The requirements outlined within the M-X MNS [Mission Needs Statement] and AOA [Analysis of Alternatives] are still valid, and the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and the associated combat lessons learned show that USSOCOM requires an air mobility platform that is more survivable, agile, flexible, and austere field capable than the current MC-130H platform, AFSOC’s most capable penetrating platform,” AFSOC explained in its Project IX Concept of Operations (CONOP). A US Air Force MC-130J refuels over Iraq or Syria in 2017., USAF The Project 10 documentation similarly used phrasing that suggested there was no actual applicable aircraft within the U.S. military. “Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) currently does not possess the capability to execute an enhanced short takeoff and landing (STOL) mission with a significant amount of cargo or personnel,” the command said bluntly in the 2013 Super Sport Capabilities Development Document (CDD). It’s interesting to note that they mention “a significant amount of cargo or personnel.” Smaller stealth penetrating special operations concepts have had less lifting capacity than a CV-22 Osprey, so this statement does not preclude the existence of such an aircraft. In addition, a smaller type capable of delivering and extracting a squad of operators would be far less expensive and risky of a program than one that mirrors the capability of a C-130. None of this addresses the possibility that one or even multiple concepts made it to the flight demonstration phase, but never proceeded past that point in a larger operational sense. In fact, there could be multiple approaches to various aspects of this unique mission set in storage or even buried out at Area 51. But it’s also worth remembering that the Project IX CONOP was only ever classified “Secret” and the Super Sport CDD was always unclassified. Though units such as the 66th Air Operations Squadron and the Aviation Technology Office technically belong to their parent services, they operate almost exclusively under the direction of JSOC and in highly compartmentalized spaces at levels of classification well above Secret. US Marines onboard a US Air Force MC-130J prepare for a nighttime freefall parachute jump during an exercise in 2017., USAF So, it is not hard to imagine that the individuals drafting the documents in question were unaware of what was or is still occurring in the “black” realm. As noted throughout this two-part story, the ever-lengthening parade of publicly acknowledged programs could easily serve as a cover for unacknowledged active developments or even operational activities. We at The War Zone have previously explored similar relationships within some of the most secretive ends of the Air Force’s unmanned aviation community . After 40 years of programs, all of the sudden having the requirement go unaddressed in any way would also be a big indicator to foreign adversaries that the capability exists and the requirement has been satisfied. So this long slog of perpetual initiatives to provide an advanced low-observable special operations transport could now serve as a necessary cover for a capability that was indeed realized some time ago. Furthermore, the demand for stealthy, or at least stealthier combat support aircraft, such as aerial refueling tankers and transports , is rapidly becoming a necessity for conventional units as the air defense capabilities of potential opponents continue to improve. Why would the U.S. military’s most elite units have ignored this reality, on top of their own standing requirements, for so long? “The Super Sport program is not new in concept nor requirement; the need to provide SOF support any time, any place can be directly traced to the Credible Sport programs of the 1980s,” AFSOC declared in 2013. “The Super Sport program is the natural evolution in AFSOCs desire to provide flexible solutions to SOF requirements.” With this in mind, if the U.S. military does indeed still lack this capability after all these years and piles of money spent, it would seem to be an outrageous oversight.

Craig Picken and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021",Confessions Of An E-2C Hawkeye Radar Operator,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It may not be glamorous, but the largely misunderstood Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is arguably the most important aircraft deployed aboard America’s supercarriers. It acts as the high-flying eyes of the carrier strike group and provides critical air traffic control and combat management for carrier air wing aircraft, as well as communications relay and other functions. Retired Naval Flight Officer Craig “Slim” Picken worked in the inhospitable confines of the Hawkeye’s fuselage during one of the most interesting times in modern military history, rattling off intercept orders to missile-laden Tomcats and coordinating the ballet of U.S. Navy carrier-borne tactical aircraft as they plied their deadly trade over Iraq. So come with us as we follow “Slim” into the tight confines of the Hawkeye’s belly, take a seat alongside him in front of one of the glowing radar consoles and get ready to get to catapult off on a voyage that will make you understand the Navy’s vaunted airborne early warning and control plane like never before. The Reality Had Top Gun filmmakers been accurate in their account, the opening scene with Maverick would have been handled completely differently. Under the powerful radar and watchful eyes of its crew, the E-2 Hawkeye, flying at 27,000 feet, would have spotted the incoming “bogeys” from more than 150 miles away. Maverick’s Tomcat would have been quarterbacked with a real-time picture, accompanied with data-link updates and a familiar voice helping with the “target sorts.” A surprise 2nd bogey? Not a chance! Cougar wouldn’t have been jumped and would have kept his wings to fight another day. Today, the entire dogfight might have be quarterbacked by the E-2 without its controllers even saying a word. But Top Gun was a movie about fighter pilots, not the cast working tirelessly behind the scenes to support them. The E-2 Hawkeye is like the Offensive Coordinator on an NFL team. He sits high up near the press box and well out of sight from the crowd, but very much in the game. His knowledge, God’s eye view, situational awareness, headset, and microphone are his weapons. Yes, he is out of sight, but make no mistake who is calling the offensive plays. Seaforces.org Flying Quarterback Despite its ugly looks and slow and lumbering airframe, the Hawkeye is the most sophisticated airplane on the aircraft carrier flight deck. Its mission is Airborne Early Warning (AEW) and battle management. Its long-range AN/APS-139/145 radar is capable of spotting and tracking thousands of contacts from hundreds of miles away. Coupled with its complex radio suite that provides secure and satellite communications to other aircraft, surface ships and ground forces, as well as its advanced IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) capability and high-speed data links, the airplane is the go-to tool for battle management and control. In fact, the air wing, and the (carrier) battle group to some extent, could not function without it. If you doubt my word, just ask the British Navy regarding their experience in the Falklands 35 years ago, which occurred without the help of Airborne Early Warning. Oh, and don’t let the E-2’s size fool you. Its five-person crew, two Naval Aviators (pilots) and three Naval Flight Officers (NFOs, the radar operators), are highly trained and skilled, and the reality is that the new E-2D Advanced Hawkeye can do everything its larger cousin, the E-3 Sentry AWACS, can do, but with a whopping 20 fewer people onboard. USN The Airplane I’m not sure how the Grumman engineers came to develop the E-2, because it’s an engineering marvel that got beaten by an ugly stick. Its design also overcomes several extraordinary challenges that needed to be addressed for the airplane to meet its unique mission requirements. First, the 24-foot wide radar dish is neutral in flight. It provides as much aerodynamic lift as it does parasitic drag. Second, the engines and propellers provide enough power to allow for engine-out climb capability should the Hawkeye lose an engine mid cat-stroke (catapult launch). The T-56 engines on the E-2C each provided 4,950 shaft horsepower and spin a huge propeller at 1,100 rpm. On the newer versions, the horsepower has been increased to 5,100 horsepower. Third, both propellers spin counter-clockwise creating a lot of yaw instability, thus, the reason for the four vertical stabilizers and three rudders. The propellers are made of composite material to eliminate interference with the radar’s performance. Fourth, big airframe needed to hold all the equipment must fit on an aircraft carrier deck.  This means that the 80-foot wingspan has to fold so that the airplane can be neatly tucked away. Like every airplane, the design is a compromise. It does some things well, others not so much. It will never be fast. It will never be pretty. And, because it’s a turboprop it’s limited to about a 28,000-foot ceiling, above which the props become inefficient. It’s a beast of an airplane that weighs in at more than 26 tons. USN The Radar Located inside the 24-foot dorsally-mounted dish is the AN/APS-139/145 UHF-band radar that can track targets from well over 200 miles away.  The original Hawkeye mission was Airborne Early Warning (AEW)—an airborne platform that could protect the aircraft carrier and battle group assets from Russian bombers carrying long-range missiles, as well as enemy ships and other threats, which it did well. To enhance its effectiveness as a battle manager, the Hawkeye’s radar picture can be data-linked to multiple destroyers and cruisers located hundreds of miles away, to create a monstrous, virtually impenetrable air defense posture. When coupled with the highly effective Aegis Combat System’s SPY-1 radars found on guided missile cruisers or destroyers, that posture can extend well over 500 nautical miles. Via Link 4 and Link 16 data links, that same picture can also be transmitted directly into the cockpit of fighter and attack aircraft. Coordinated air intercepts can be done with literally no verbal communications. But the radar was challenged in that its UHF frequency ranges were optimized for maritime use and its early mission computers were both heavy and, at least by today’s standards, horrifically obsolete. Thus, it was not the most effective platform to detect low flying threats over land or in a high clutter radar environment. With new radar, systems, and computers, the new E-2D, however, provides game-changing performance in any environment. USN The Back-End The E-2 has three Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) in the back: RO – Radar Operator. Responsible for maintaining the radar, data-links, and passive detection systems. Will also have aircraft under his or her control. The RO sits in the most forward seat and is often the most junior aircrew. New NFOs in the squadron are only qualified in this seat until deemed ready to move to another. ACO – Air Control Officer. Guy controlling most of the air wing assets. May have up to 20 airplanes under his control. He’s the furthest aft and stays very busy. CICO – Combat Information Center Officer. The “Mission Commander” who is usually the most senior person. He’s got the “big picture” and is talking to everyone. To become a CICO is a year or more long process and the qualification is blessed by the other squadron CICOs and the squadron Commanding Officer. As a RO or ACO your every move is monitored and graded.  If you can’t cut it in both of those seats, you don’t become a CICO and your Navy career is ruined. With Desert Storm under my belt, I earned the CICO designation in a fast 10 months. No matter what seat one is in, each officer is staring into a radar screen and tracking targets. Before each launch, the CICO does rounds around the ship and meets with the fighter and attack squadrons and the ship’s Combat Information Center to get the overall “big picture.”  If large combat missions were occurring, he’d sit in the briefing and discuss the plan. Additionally, the E-2 crew briefs the flight two hours before launch and mans-up the airplane an hour before. It takes that long to do pre-flights and get the radar warmed up. Typically, the Hawkeye is the first to launch and the last to land. Not because everyone deems it special, but because its size makes it the most difficult aircraft to maneuver on the flight deck. This means a four to five-hour flight is really an 8 or 9 hour day when factoring in the brief, flight, and debrief. USN The Hawkeye-Tomcat Team For three decades, the Hawkeye-Tomcat combination was an intimidating duo that could pack a hell of a punch. The Hawkeye’s long-range radar coordinating the Tomcat’s payload of Sidewinder, Sparrow, and, most notably, AIM-54 Phoenix radar-guided missiles gave carrier air wings an anti-air capability unmatched anywhere in the world. The AIM-54 Phoenix proved the most fearsome as it allowed the F-14 to engage multiple targets simultaneously from long distances. Had the Russians launched multiple Tu-95 Bear, Tu-16 Badger, or Tu-22M Backfire bombers to attack the battlegroup, they would have surely been detected by the carrier’s Hawkeye and shot down by a Tomcat from distances over 100 nautical miles away. Until the demise of the USSR in 1991, the Russians constantly practiced their attacks on the aircraft carrier, and the air wings continually practiced their defensive profiles. It was a never-ending cat and mouse game that both sides got very good at playing There were two occasions where my crews tracked Russian Bears – once while transiting out of Subic Bay the Philippines in early 1991. The second time we launched off a 30 minute alert in the Northern Pacific when the Bears decided to visit us from their home in the Kamchatka Peninsula.  Each time they were intercepted by our Tomcat brethren, with a Phoenix under their bellies. USN “No Respect!” The E-2 is a bit like Rodney Dangerfield. It rarely gets the respect it deserves. This fact was pointedly made at Fightertown USA—Naval Air Station Miramar—by one of our squadron pilots, Westin “Son of Sam” (SOS) Richardson, or “Sauce” for short. Upon landing one afternoon, SOS promptly radioed “Tower, Sun King is clear of the duty. Taxi to the Leper Colony.” At the time, all the Hawkeyes were quartered in Hangar 6, at the very west end of the airfield, about as far away from TOPGUN as they could possibly get. Judging from the hysterical laughter coming from the tower, they fully understood our intent! Throughout my Navy career, never did a reporter or news crew ask us what we did or the importance of the mission. If we took an airplane to an airshow, we lived a lonely existence. When CNN came onboard the USS Ranger , and they occasionally did, they just wanted film the glamorous Tomcats launching in full afterburner. “ TOP GUN!” If anyone ever asked me if I was TOP GUN , my answer was “no, I’m more like the anonymous Key Grip from the movie. I just make sure the shit shows up.” The NFOs in the back, who do their jobs in a darkened tube, are often referred to as “Moles.”  I’m not sure anyone joins the Navy to become a “Mole.” Seaforces.org Respect Is Earned I say that “respect is earned” in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner. Within my Air Wing (CVW-2) we held a unique standing. We never got the glory or attention that the fighter and attack pilots got, but we were held in high esteem on the pecking order. Everyone, at some point, was going to ask for our help. As a squadron, we were a group of 25 highly competitive, disciplined Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers led by squadron commanders who drove us hard. From the day you arrived on the squadron quarterdeck you put on your flak jacket. Any sense of weakness you showed, at any time, was exploited in every manner possible. The ready room atmosphere could be brutal! We carried this attitude with us every day. Our Air Wing brethren saw we were hard playing, hardworking, competitive officers and aviators, which carried a lot of weight. After a while, the VAW-116 Sun Kings became known on the west coast as the “Fun Kings.” USN A Unique Community Upon arrival to the squadron on you realized that nobody really chose to be there. In my squadron, VAW-116, I don’t think one Junior Officer signed up to fly an ugly lumbering turboprop. The pilots were top players in flight school who got drafted into the Hawkeye pipeline. Most were frustrated fighter or attack wannabes. The NFOs in the back were all the same. Nonetheless, almost all the pilots were some of the best you’d ever find—outstanding “ball flyers,” outstanding in helping out with the mission when needed, and outstanding in an emergency when one arose. “Cowpie” was a professional rodeo bull rider before joining the Navy. He would entertain us with his hilarious stories about driving his van across West Texas and Oklahoma, going from rodeo to rodeo. Another, “Gordo”, learned to fly gliders in his youth. Today, he is a world-champion glider pilot. Cowpie went on to become the Commodore of the entire west coast E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 Greyhound wing. The NFOs were often brilliant. Intimidatingly so. Several squadron mates who didn’t make the Navy a career have gone on to become highly successful CEOs, CFOs, lawyers, and entrepreneurs. Others who did make it a career went on to become aircraft carrier commanders, air wing commanders and admirals. USN Getting Respect Getting respect within the air wing is not a given. It’s often hard work and to get it, many of us became fully integrated with our fighter and attack brethren. The respect earning phase started during “work-up” cycles—the various at-sea training periods when we’d all learn how to work together. For junior A-6 or F-14 crews, it was the first time ever they’d work alongside a Hawkeye. During these cycles, several of our officers would be in another squadron’s ready room. They could be bullshitting on a friendly basis or deep in the manual of an F-14 or A-6. Or, we’d simply connect in the ship gym or over a meal in the wardroom. It was the little gestures of “we’ve got your back” that solidified the relationship between the E-2 crews and everyone else. Trust is monumental. As an example, during our transit to Desert Storm, our CAG (the Carrier Air Wing Commander) became obsessed that coded Mode 4 IFF (Identify Friend or Foe) transponder worked in every airplane for every mission. If we were going to fly combat, he wanted to ensure no friendly-on-friendly engagements occurred. To prove his point, any aircraft that launched without operable Mode 4 was sent to the “penalty box”—an area 20,000 feet directly above the carrier—and forced to hold in a pattern until the end of the cycle. Usually 90 minutes or so. It sucked and the crews hated it. After each airplane launched, its IFF was interrogated by the ship looking for positive Mode 4 response.  If it was “sweet,” the aircraft could proceed to its mission. If “sour,” to the “box” they went. As the airborne commander, however, we could override the ship. We had an IFF interrogator too, and who was to say we were wrong? “Strike, King has Wolf 101 sweet, sweet. 101, head 090 to the tanker, Angels 20.” I’d then follow up the call a few minutes later on the tanker frequency, “Wolf, get your gadget fixed.” They got it and appreciated the gesture. USN Yep, We Got Booze During my squadron tenure, I was dating a Delta Airlines flight attendant and every so often I’d get a care package complete with a few dozen mini-bottles of vodka. Because alcohol is strictly forbidden on the ship, we’d keep it stashed in a space under the bottom rack in our stateroom, which I shared with two other officers. The empties? We’d take them to the usually empty ship’s forecastle and drop them into the ocean via the anchor-chain openings. No, we never got crazy, but it was something to take the edge off after a long day or extended period at sea. We’d mix the vodka with “bug juice” taken from the officer’s mess and, sometimes, have a small gathering with the crews from VF-1 who lived along the same passageway. One night, our CO banged on our door, which sent us scrambling to hide the evidence. We let him in and we could tell he’d had a really bad day. “I need a drink” he proclaimed. With amused looks on our faces we responded, “sorry, Skipper, wrong place…” “Fuck you! I need a drink.” We gave him two bottles. Nothing was ever spoken of it. It was just another trust-building exercise. USN It Isn’t Flying First Class The Hawkeye is a very uncomfortable airplane. The three Naval Flight Officers (NFO) in the back sit sideways for four-plus hours in a dark tube, on a de-armed ejection seat, with the nose of the airplane slanted 12 degrees nose-up. The vibration of the then four monstrous (now eight) propeller blades was loud and exhausting. The air conditioning never worked well, either. Thus, the guy furthest aft always froze his ass off while the NFO closest to the radar boxes burned up. There were five radios with constant chatter, 20 or more airplanes to control, and radar systems that required constant attention, and so on. It was busy. I was always thankful that the airplane didn’t have in-flight refueling capability ( that’s changing now ). The torture was limited to five hours. A single flight was tiring. Two in the same day was exhausting! E-2D undergoing aerial refueling testing., Northrop Grumman The Downsides Of No Aerial Refueling Capability Not having aerial refueling capability had its downsides, too. Late in a six-month cruise, the ship was in the Bay of Bengal, a few hundred miles away from land. We were about four hours into a very rough night training mission and it was time to come “home.” Our pilots put the airplane into the holding pattern at 15,000 or 20,000 feet, 15 miles from the ship with about an hour’s worth of fuel left onboard. As always, we’d be last aircraft to recover Burning holes in the sky, the Air Boss announces on the radios, “all aircraft max conserve, deck is foul.” Huh? “How long, Boss?” from an anonymous voice. “About 45 minutes…” Ugggh! At the end of a very busy cruise, the non-skid coating on the aft portion of the flight deck had worn down. An F-14 being steered onto one of the waist catapults and slid off the deck and settled on a 45-degree angle in the catwalk below the deck’s edge. The crash and salvage crews were working hard to extract it. We, in the meantime, started looking at Bingo fuel (minimum safe fuel quantity to return to a landing place) and distance to Thailand. We were in a box. Not enough fuel to hang out, not enough fuel to find land. But land still seemed like the best option. I gave the pilots vectors to Phuket, Thailand. They started on a Bingo profile while my crew started working the radios to get clearance into Thai airspace. Twenty minutes later, the flight deck opened for recoveries again, but we were still Bingo fuel. Now, the ship became the best option. It was the first and only time that I can remember the mighty Hawkeye being the first aircraft to recover. USN Safety First? The Hawkeye is a typical Grumman airplane with a good safety record. But good does not mean perfect. Without ejection seats bailing out is a difficult evolution, even in a controlled flight scenario. In an uncontrolled flight situation, it is impossible. Personally, I got nervous during night time cat shots. If the catapult went “cold,” there was very little chance, if any, that all five crewmen would be able to safely get out before beings run over by an 80,000-ton ship traveling at 20 knots. The sole escape route consisted of an aft hatch, on top of the fuselage, that we kept open during launch and recovery. Also, the flight controls are operated via a redundant 3,000 psi hydraulic system. The two reservoirs are in the same area as the radar boxes and fed by multiple lines. Any leak would spray high-pressure hydraulic fluid onto a hot radar box and a raging fire could ensue. If this happened, the airplane was doomed. The crew could blow the main door hatch and bailout, but they’d get cooked in the process. Or the airplane would just lose all use of flight controls and crash. In 1992, this very scenario happened to a Hawkeye operating from the USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67), killing all five on board including one of my flight school friends, LT(JG) Tom Plautz and a previous instructor, LCDR Al McLachlen. Ironically, I was informed of that mishap the night I was manning up an airplane and flying to the USS Ranger to start a 6-month cruise. In the cockpit, pilots had the demands of an unstable airframe, the torque of two large propellers, and no Heads Up Display. Landing on the ship could be a challenge, to say the least. Several crews have had to bail out of the airplane over the years. There are few occasions where all make it out alive. USN When Disaster Strikes On one occasion, my airplane launched at roughly 21:00 for a routine four hour, “double cycle” flight. The carrier was “Blue Water Ops,” 1,000 miles from nowhere, deep in the Pacific Ocean with nowhere else to land. As we launched, there were 15 airplanes stacked above us, the previous “cycle,” waiting to come aboard. About a minute off the catapult there was a piercing voice on the launch/recovery frequency: “BOSS, 602. We gotta land NOW!” That was it. The Air Boss’s calm response was “Roger we’re clearing the deck.” And, they were. Amongst my crew, the questions were already starting, “Fire?” I asked… Nobody had a real answer. We immediately went to work. We fired up the radar and began searching for our mates. Nothing to be seen. I then called to an F-14 “Wolf, shine west. West. Angels 10 or higher. You see the Hawkeye?”  Shine was a term for the Tomcat to point his radar in an indicated direction, looking for a contact. “Negative.” We were immensely concerned! “What the fuck?” A few minutes later the boss announced a clear deck followed by the calming voice of the CAG Landing Signal Officer, Commander John “Bug” Roach. Somehow and miraculously, the airplane, flown by Erik “Wart” Holtkamp, found the ship from more than 10 miles away on a really dark night. A few moments after that we heard the LSOs call the trap. But here’s the kicker: The airplane did, indeed, have an electrical fire in the panel behind Wart’s seat. It burned through everything. The call to the flight deck was made on a PRC-90 handheld radio by one of the NFOs. Because Wart had no electrics, he had no radios, cockpit lights or navigation aids. The whole approach was made with a stand-by wet compass and a flashlight, which his co-pilot, John Irvin, held. Without electrics, the airplane’s rudder stops became inoperative, leaving only two degrees of rudder to control the aircraft. With only two degrees of rudder, Wart had no ability to bolter, or go around. There was not enough yaw control to counter the torque of the 4,950 horsepower engines and two large spinning propellers. A large power addition would simply torque-roll the airplane into the ocean. To make a long story short, Wart had one shot at the deck. He grabbed the four-wire! For the next month, the whole squadron was wary. We drove the mechanics crazy, writing up every little squawk. Nitpicking every loose screw! Not long after that night, I had a radar box burn out, which put a bunch of smoke into the cabin—a fairly benign scenario. Scared the crap out of me, nonetheless! Wart earned an Air Medal for his outstanding airmanship. USN Desert Storm The afternoon of January 17, 1991, I was standing on the flight deck looking into Iran as the USS Ranger transited the Strait of Hormuz thinking “holy shit… this is it.” Soon it would hit the fan, and a few hours later, it did. That night the USS Ranger and Air Wing 2 were a major part of the first air raids over Iraq, focusing on the southern cities and ports. The A-6 Intruders we had on our flight deck provided the Navy’s only true all day, all night, all-weather attack capability. The Tomcats flew Combat Air Patrol (CAP). We Hawkeye guys quarterbacked it all, keeping a close look-out for Iraqi air opposition, monitored the air wing’s assets, and preventing “blue-on-blue” (friendly fire) engagements. With so many airplanes in the sky, and highly caffeinated aircrews on high alert, blue-on-blue incidents were a very real possibility. The first nights over Iraq were pure, unadulterated, controlled chaos! During each mission, the NFOs had their hands full. Each controlled a bunch of airplanes, updated surface combatants, kept the radar profile and data links optimized. It was exhausting. We’d do it for two hours, get a 10-minute break as a new round of attack aircraft entered the fray, and then do it all again for another two hours. Once relieved by the next Hawkeye, we’d head back to the ship, mentally spent. Once relieved on station, we’d start the journey back to the ship. During the half hour transit, someone would fall asleep. Once, that someone was me and I forgot to lock my harness.  Upon snagging the arresting gear, the airplane rapidly slowed to a stop… But I didn’t. My momentum threw me into the bulkhead circuit board 18 inches in front of the RO seat. That woke me up and hurt too. Because the A-6’s were optimized for nighttime attacks, that is when we flew. Thus, our day started at 4pm and ended late morning the next day. Breakfast was dinner, dinner was breakfast. Sometime during the hostilities, the ship’s Captain took mercy upon us and turned one wardroom around 12 hours so that breakfast was served at 17:00. Ranger photographed shortly after Desert Storm with her “Grumman Air Wing” deployed ., Seaforces.org When You Not Sleeping Or Flying You Are Training Our Commanding and Executive Officer during Desert Storm, Commanders Pat Madison and Paul Hauser, were big on training. During transit to the Persian Gulf, they had every officer in the ready-room every day for hours at a time. Topics included aircraft systems, emergency procedures, geography, divert airfields, and everything else we could discuss. At the time it seemed ad nauseam, but it got us sharp. Of particular importance were ROE (Rules of Engagement). As the “eyes in the sky” and battlefield commanders, we were expected to know the complicated ROE cold ! Again, we spent hours discussing it and working through hundreds of scenarios. We knew our shit and became the air wing experts. It was our job to be just that. At one point I was sent to Saudi Arabia to fly with an E-3 Sentry AWACS crew with the goal of understanding how the E-3 operated. The night I got there, there was a USAF General discussing ROE and the crews didn’t know it nearly as well as us. It wasn’t necessarily their fault. The USAF had been on station for several months and were highly tasked. Highly tasked meant little time to do anything but fly. Seeing that I did know the ROE, the General made me do an hour training session and then asked me why I knew it so well. My response was simple: “If we’re not flying, we’re training.” There isn’t anywhere to hide on an aircraft carrier. If the CO says, “we’re training,” then you were training! The follow-on CO and XO were the same. “You will train until you drop!” And we did, every night. USN Bogey And Bandit Once it was determined during Desert Storm that the Iraqi air force was defeated, the words “bogey” and “bandit” were eliminated from our vocabulary. That is unless it was confirmed that the target of interest was, indeed, a bad guy we were told to never say those words. At the tail end of the hostilities, we had a section of VF-2 Tomcats flying TARPS reconnaissance in eastern Iraq. The profile was for them to hit the tanker around Baghdad and then fly low towards Basra, take their pictures, and head back to the USS Ranger in the northern Persian Gulf. Flying above them was a section of VF-1 Tomcats. I was flying in the ACO seat during the mission, casually watching and listening to the E-3 AWACs control a section of capping F-15s. I start hearing its controller spouting out: “Bogey, Bullseye south, 50 miles” Me : “Bulldog, King. Negative. Positive Mode 2 (Military IFF). Coalition aircraft.” AWACS : “Roger, friendly” followed by an affirmative by the Eagles. Two minutes later: AWACS: “Bogey, northwest bullseye, 60 miles heading south.” Me : “Negative Bulldog. I’ve got positive ID. Navy Hornets.” AWACS : “Roger, friendly.” Every time the controller called bogey, the Eagles got spooled up. It probably happened five or six times. I looked over at my CICO, Bob Roth, and chuckled “WTF is up with these guys?  Bogies all over the place.” I couldn’t get the comment out when I heard “bandits, east bullseye 40 miles. Flight of two flying low heading south!” Shit! The Eagles turned on a dime and started calling their sorts, determining which F-15 would shoot which target. Dash 1 had the lead F-14 and his wingman had targeted the second Tomcat. In combat terms, “bandit” meant confirmed bad guy. Shoot first, ask questions later. And the frequency got jammed between the E-3 calling out the “bandits” and the Eagles sorting their targets. All I could do was scream out on the guard frequency (frequency 243.0) “Eagles engaged, King… knock it off, knock it off, knock it off. Friendlies. Knock it off .” Thankfully, the F-15s heard the calls and immediately disengaged. A few minutes later the voice from the E-3 changed as a new controller took over. I think someone got their ass chewed. What was funny is that the TARPS F-14s never knew what was happening. They were on a different frequency talking to the RO in my aircraft. It wasn’t until we were back on the ship when I asked one of them “hey, did you guys get some tones?” “Yeah, briefly. Came and went, quick.” We told them the story, and everyone laughed. “Holy Shit! Really?” Nobody thought anything of it, but someone overheard us talking. From there it made the Admiral’s briefing and got elevated further to General Schwarzkopf who put out a “let’s not go crazy” message to the entire theater. I got a “good Job” from above, which made me feel good. On the flip side, a week or so previous the quick thinking of AWACS crew prevented a Navy blue-on-blue when an F-14 mistakenly identified an A-6 as hostile. Despite inter-service rivalries, everyone had each other’s back. Towards the end of February, 1991, it was a Sun King Hawkeye, led by Lt. Jack Kennedy, that quarterbacked the final raids on Iraq, known as the “Highway of Death” when USS Ranger ’s A-6 Intruders discovered and attacked a massive retreating Iraqi convoy. Another one of my squadron mates leveraged surveillance assets to target a Silkworm missile launch site. Once located, he controlled several Ranger A-6s and guided them to the area where they dropped a trash load of Rockeye cluster bombs . To this day, I think the guy who invented Rockeye must have been one sick dude. It is devastating to every living organism in its path. USN Just After The Storm Had Passed Five months into the cruise, the USS Ranger was now heading east towards home, but we got tasked with one more exercise along the way. A B-52 would fly from Guam and try to attack the ship. The goal was to “shoot it down” outside of its missile launch range, which was roughly inside 200 miles. Probably 20 or more airplanes were involved. We set up our stations with another Hawkeye a few hundred miles away, a bunch of CAP F-14s for fighter protection, EA-6Bs for electronic warfare and S-3s and A-6s to provide gas. Nobody really cared. It was end of cruise and we were exhausted. Let’s get it done. For hours we sat there. Nothing… At one point, I saw a blip on the radar, far away from any F-14, and well inside the defensive perimeter. I vectored an S-3 Viking to look. Shazaam! About 20 miles from the ship the S-3 reports a visual on a B-52 flying very low . At about the same time the bomber calls the ship “ Ranger , B-52 from the south. Requesting a fly-by.” Uh Oh! Five minutes later, with pictures to prove it, the B-52 flies by the Ranger at an altitude below the flight deck, probably 50 feet off the water.  Literally, it had been flying at 100 feet or less for several hundred miles, its Electronic Warfare Officer did a great job at detecting and evading our radars. Oh, boy! We got yelled at and our CO got called into the CAGs office and got yelled at, too. Later that night we were having cocktails in my stateroom when one of the F-14 RIOs stopped by for a drink. “Yeah, we saw the thing on our radar. We were just screwing around. Didn’t feel like chasing it.” As I said, the air wing was tired. Nobody cared. We took the heat, but it eventually blew over. I’m sure we didn’t do our CO any favors, though. This photo shows the exact flyby described above. , USN Somalia Late into my second six-month USS Ranger deployment, we left the Persian Gulf for Somalia and Operation Restore Hope. Nobody knew what we were supposed to do, but we went anyway. Our missions started simply as a radio relay for the Marines on the ground. Boring stuff. But, a day or two into it we saw that there were literally hundreds of NGO (non-government organization) and military relief airplanes trying to land in Mogadishu all at the same time. Now that the Americans secured the airport, it was safe to bring in supplies. It was crazy! Hundreds of airplanes ranging from USAF C-5s to a guy in a Piper Chieftain all converging on a single runway next to the coast. I was the CICO on the mission and started speaking to my crew. We were going to input an oft-used tactic and modify it for civilian use. Looking at my RO I said “you start directing airplanes to here,” putting a waypoint on our radar screens. “Stack them 1,000 feet starting a 5,000. Set them up for an approach. Give them push times a few minutes apart.” Looking at my ACO I said “you keep control of this thing. When one of these guys lands, tell the next to start his approach, then drop the stack down 1,000 feet. Everyone starts their approach at 5,000 feet.” They got it! We just took charge and began barking orders to the flock of airplanes. Soon we started to sound like New York air traffic control! The civilian pilots loved it too, as did the military support on the ground. The chaos was getting controlled and we kept it up for nearly five hours straight. When we got relieved by the next crew, we told them what we did. They carried on the same plan, modified it a little bit more and made it even better. Upon landing, we debriefed the ship’s Combat Information Center. Damn if we didn’t start something great! A day later the Admiral moved an Aegis cruiser closer to the coastal airport and manned it with Ranger air traffic controllers. The Aegis radar is accurate to a gnat’s ass and this now became Approach Control. The Air Force put some of its folks in the tower with hand-held radios. The Hawkeye now became Center. We handed off airplanes to the cruiser, who was now Approach Control. They, in turn, handed it off to Tower. Rudimentary and makeshift, but we now had a fully functioning air traffic control system that stayed in place for several months with the next carrier group, long after we left Somalia for a port visit in Australia. I was heartbroken when I learned of the Black Hawk Down fiasco several months later. USN Panama During the Summer of 1991, a few months after returning from Iraq, my squadron was sent to Panama to do three months of counter-narcotics missions. The airplanes were parked at Howard Air Force Base. The crews were relegated to Rodman Naval Base, located on the banks of the Panama Canal. Our accommodations? For those senior enough there were accommodations in base housing. If not, and I wasn’t, we were sent to a neighborhood of steel Quonset huts furnished with surplus hospital beds and salvaged furniture. The walls in my hut were decorated with Playboys courtesy of the squadrons before us. Our cooking facilities? An old Weber grill. We had to buy our own food, paper plates, and picnic supplies. It sucked. What sucked even worse was the flying. We’d fly at night and head either west to a waypoint in the Pacific or Northeast into the Atlantic. The entire time we’d data-link our radar picture to a Navy frigate. On the occasions we’d see a drug runner, and we did, we’d vector USAF F-16s or other assets to intercept. The mission was mindlessly boring and it could be dangerous. Flying 500 miles over open ocean at night is dangerous enough, but we were used to it. What we weren’t used to were huge thunderstorm buildups. One night, a crew was flying back from a Pacific mission only to run into a line of thunderstorms. With no onboard weather radar, they had to pick their way through the lines via ambient moonlight. It took them at least an hour to do so and by then they were dangerously low on fuel. In between landing and taxi, the low fuel lights came on. They may have had another 20 minutes of flying time, at most. Just like the cockpit fire did, we got concerned and started abbreviating the missions a bit. USN All Good Things… After three years, two cruises and two full workup cycles, I transitioned out of VAW-116 with well over 1,000 hours of flight time and 325 carrier landings, the vast majority of which occurred at night. I also flew more than 100 missions total over Iraq and accomplished what I had set out to do. At the end of our second cruise, I was a senior Lieutenant, so my CO allowed me to fly home to San Diego commercially from our last port call in Hawaii. The ship needed the space for the onslaught of “Tiger Cruisers,” family of the crew who wanted to experience what their kids experience in the Navy. I think he was ready to get rid of me, too. When I got on the Northwest Airlines DC-10 in Oahu, I knew I’d experienced my last Cat and Trap. I was done. A month later I transitioned to NATO in Germany where I would spend the last two years of my Navy career. From there, I would choose to enter civilian life. No, it wasn’t my first choice, but the Hawkeye was a rewarding airplane to crew. I’m forever grateful to the Navy for giving me the opportunity to do so.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 20, 2019",France’s Elite GIGN Counter Terror Unit Still Has A Cult-Like Affinity For The Revolver,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Groupe d’Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale, better known by its abbreviated name GIGN, which translates to National Gendarmerie Intervention Group in English, remains France’s premier counter-terrorism and hostage rescue unit. Since its founding shortly after the terrorist acts in Munich in 1973, GIGN has risen to prominence among the world’s counter-terrorism community. But one piece of gear in particular not only differentiates the unit from others, but it is also deeply ingrained in its lore and tradition—the revolver, and in particular, the French-built Manurhin MR73. A few years ago, I did a big feature on the revolver-toting GIGN operatives as well as France’s other counter-terror units. You can read that in full here . But the advent of a Twitter page belonging to the Commandant of GIGN has provided us with unique insights into the renowned unit. In a video posted on the page’s feed, we see just how central the MR73 is to the unit’s esprit de corps: The revolvers are issued to each GIGN member for symbolic reasons as well as utilitarian ones. A passage from a 2014 issue of the official Gendarmerie information magazine states: “Respect of human life and fire discipline have always been taught to group members since inception, and each new member is traditionally issued with a 6 shot .357 revolver as a reminder of these values.” GIGN’s deep relationship with the revolver gets pretty intense beyond any outright symbolism. Apparently, the unit still practices a ‘trust shot’ as part of new member initiations where a team member wearing body armor puts a clay pigeon over their center of mass and the newly minted GIGN operator shoots the disc from 15 yards. This type of thing is very rare, at least officially, in elite western law enforcement and special operations units these days, but GIGN seems to have continued with the practice, which is also tied directly to the MR73 revolver. There is a thread on the aforementioned Twitter page that explains the justification and meaning for GIGN behind the ‘trust shot’ (Google translated): After 14 months of training, each, the day before receiving his patent, passes a final test: a shot at one of his comrades. It is a 15m shot to the revolver, weapon used for instruction, on a clay pigeon, fixed on the bulletproof vest of the “target.” This shot takes on a particular symbolism, beyond the technical gesture, mastered at the end of formation. He illustrates trust in itself: “I have received training that makes me confident, sure to reach my target without a doubt. I will not fail. “ Mutual trust: “He trusts me, he will not move, for fear or bad reflex, the second I fire.” Mutual trust always: “I trust the one who is aiming at me. Trained like me, he will not miss his target.” Finally, my former, already patented, with whom I will leave on a mission from tomorrow can now grant me their confidence. The truth is, the MR73, which is commonly chambered in .38 Special/.357 Magnum, isn’t just about style, tradition, or French pride. Tactical revolvers still have critical advantages over auto-loading pistols for counter-terror and SWAT-type units. Because they don’t have a slide, they can fire through small openings in and alongside armored shields far more reliably than their semi-automatic pistol counterparts. A modern autoloading pistol’s slide can interact with a shield or even another member’s body while in tight formation and cause malfunctions at the absolute worst possible time imaginable. Keep in mind, if you are pushing a shield into a possible gunfight than you are likely the point man. In fact, tactical units in the U.S. went to Smith and Wesson with this same problem, which resulted in the R8 eight-round tactical revolver and the TRR8 that came shortly after it. Revolvers are also very accurate and extremely reliable, which is really important when you have to know your weapon will go bang and that the bullet will hit what you are aiming at during tight close-quarter combat scenarios, like engagement on planes, trains, buses, or in crowded buildings. These setting don’t usually require huge volumes of fire either, so the capacity limitations of a revolver become less of an issue. Over the years semi-automatic pistols have become more reliable and accurate, so the revolver’s relevance outside of very specific situations has waned. But still, the MR73, in particular, is a very well built, heavy, and highly accurate revolver and is widely regarded as being among the finest ‘wheel guns’ ever built. Clearly, GIGN sees it as a lightsaber of sorts—an elegant weapon whose time may have largely passed for all but the most capable operators. But for those who can employ it with extreme efficiency, it still remains a potent, if not superior in some respects, tool for many applications. Public Domain So even though GIGN furnishes modern high capacity autoloading pistols to its operators for many operations, the MR73 still serves in something of a ceremonial and utilitarian role for the unit to this very day and that doesn’t look like it will change anytime soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 13, 2020",Behold Arguably The Most Spectacular Photo Of NASA’s Shuttle Carrier Aircraft Ever,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When I was last down at Edwards AFB, I also spent some time at what is now known as Armstrong Flight Research Center. Before the name change in 2014, it had been famously titled the Dryden Flight Research Center. During my time with the awesome public affairs team there, a photo on the wall grabbed my attention. It was an incredible image of one of NASA’s two Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) with the Orbiter Endeavor mated to its back as it flew over a gorgeous desert landscape. But what made the shot so amazing was how the perspective was from directly above, looking down. I was told that the photo, taken in December of 2008 as Endeavor made its voyage back to Kennedy Space Center in Florida, was one of the most beloved in at the installation and that it was shot by one of NASA’s most acclaimed photographers, Carla Thomas. If I remember correctly, the photo was planned ahead of time and executed perfectly from the back seat of Armstrong’s F/A-18B . The aircraft had rolled inverted—or near inverted—to capture the unique angle of the loaded-up SCA. NASA photo by  Carla Thomas Remembering this amazing shot, I posted the photo on Twitter last night and it received such an amazing outpouring of love that I had to do a story on it and especially on the SCA and its own awesome but relatively humble history. The Space Shuttle has such a colorful history , one full of obscure but fascinating facts , but the program wouldn’t have been possible without the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft that called Dryden/Armstrong home throughout their second-shots at life working for NASA. Both of the SCAs, NASA #905 and NASA #911, were Boeing 747-100 series jumbo jets and acquired second hand and deeply modified to be able to lift the orbiters aloft. #905 was bought from American Airlines in 1974 and was first used by NASA for wake turbulence testing before being selected for the Shuttle program. #911 was bought from Japan Airlines in 1989. Both SCAs together at Dryden in 1995., NASA photo by Ruby Calzada Originally the Shuttle Program eyed Lockheed’s C-5 Galaxy as the best candidate for the SCA, one of the C-5’s many imagined potential roles —but the 747 was deemed a better fit due to its low-wing layout and its tail configuration, among other factors. As part of the conversion process, both 747s were stripped of almost all their interior airliner accouterments, including insulation and inner fuselage paneling, to save weight. Just a handful of first-class seats located in the aircraft’s nose section were left to ferry a limited number of NASA employees on cross-country missions. #905 and #911 over the Mojave Desert near Edwards AFN., NASA Photo by Carla Thomas The SCA’s fuselages were strengthened and a strut system was installed to accommodate lugging a 170,000-pound Orbiter on the spine of the aircraft. The SCA’s cockpit avionics were also enhanced as were the aircraft’s JT9D turbofan engines. Vertical stabilizers were installed on the horizontal tail sections to overcome directional stability lost by the orbiter blocking a good portion of the 747’s substantial vertical tail. A ballast system was also implemented to keep the aircraft’s center of gravity within operating limits when the Orbiter was not attached. The addition of an external orbiter resulted in the otherwise totally stripped 747’s spritely performance turning into the exact opposite. An aircraft that had intercontinental range by design now had to stop multiple times to refuel just to make it between Edwards AFB in California to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The SCA could only fly about 1,000 nautical miles with the orbiter attached as opposed to 5,500 without it. The last flight of the SCA with an orbiter mated to its back. On September 21st, 2012 #905 would go on a 4.5-hour tour of California before landing at LAX, resulting in some of the best aviation photos of all time. , U.S. Air Force photo/Jet Fabara The jet was also limited to just .6 Mach and a lowly 15,000-foot ceiling when lugging an orbiter on its back. This meant that each mission to Kennedy would require three stops and would take two to three days to complete. A pathfinder aircraft would also have to fly the route ahead of the SCA to make sure there were no storms along the way that could damage the orbiter’s delicate thermal shield made out of LI-900 silica tiles or induce high loads on the mated pair of flying machines. It was a slow, intricate, and expensive process with each trip costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. When you factored in loading and unloading the orbiter on via custom-built gantry, the process involved a team of over 170 people to accomplish. But putting the complexities of its mission aside, there was added flexibility that the SCA brought to the Space Shuttle program that is seldom talked about. An Orbiter gets mounted on to #911’s spine at Dryden., NASA photo by Jim Ross Due to a large number of contingencies that could occur during a Shuttle mission, especially during launch, an orbiter could end up diverting to one of the dozens of large airstrips located around the globe and specially outfitted with the unique instrument landing system that made consistent and safe recoveries of the orbiter possible. Crews at these sites would also be on ready to respond to a stricken orbiter and its potentially badly injured crew. But if an orbiter were to land in Dakar, Senegal following an emergency, NASA would need to get it out of there as fast as possible. This is where the SCA would swoop in and begin the processing of a remote site loading operation. In some cases, the orbiter’s payload would have had to of been removed from the orbiter’s payload bay and flown back separately by military cargo aircraft due to SCA weight restrictions. Thankfully this capability was never used, but in 1983, an SCA packing the test Orbiter Enterprise flew across the pond for a tour of Europe. This included making an appearance at the Paris Air Show. In order to get there, the SCA stopped in Goose Bay, Keflavik, RAF Fairford, and went on to make appearances in West Germany, France, and Italy. NASA was interested in potentially porting the E-4B and KC-747’s aerial refueling capabilities over to the SCA design and tests were flown behind a KC-135, but for a number of reasons the concept didn’t make it out of the exploratory phase. The most amazing feat the SCA concept ever accomplished had nothing to do with repositioning the orbiter, it had to do with launching it off its back. The relatively terrifying task of acting as a launch platform for Enterprise during the high-risk Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) phase of the Shuttle Program is still something to behold. Just one SCA crew would support the ALT phase, which consisted of a number of mated roundtrip flights and five free flights where the Orbiter would separate and fly back to land at Edwards AFB. Enterprise pulling away from SCA during one of its first three free flights as part of the ALT phase of the Shuttle Program., NASA image by Ruby Calzada Separating a single flying thing into two flying things can be a dangerous act no matter how much data there is to predict the outcome. And it’s not like the crew of the SCA had ejection seats to get them out of the aircraft quickly if the Shuttle slammed back into its mothership during the separation trials. A crew escape tunnel similar to the one added to the first 747 prototype was installed in #905 before the ALT phase began in case the aircraft lost control and the crew had to bail out. Later on, it was deleted due to fear of the crew being ingested into the engines and because the SCA had proven itself safe and reliable at carrying the orbiter around. But regardless of the escape tunnel being available, there was a pretty good chance that if the two huge flying bodies made contact that a big fireball full of debris would result. Even after the initial three separation/ALT trials were successful, Enterprise and SCA #905 had to go through it all again, this time the aerodynamic fairing over the Orbiter’s rump removed. Enterprise on approach to land at Edwards AFB on October 12, 1977. This was the fourth of five free flights during the ALT phase. , NASA image by Ruby Calzada The Shuttle’s nozzles and abrupt trailing edge change the airflow behind the spacecraft, with far more turbulent air buffeting the SCA’s empennage, so that evolution was also potentially perilous. Two of these test flights occurred, which successfully closed out the ALT phase of the Shuttle’s development. Both of the SCAs were retired in 2012 as the Shuttle Program finally came to an end. Parts primarily from #911 are being used to keep NASA’s 747SP SOFIA flying observatory operational. #911 is on display at Plant 42 in Palmdale, where the Orbiters were built. #905 was the last to fly an Orbiter, delivering Endeavor to Los Angeles before heading to Houston to be put on static display at Space Center Houston with the orbiter mockup Independence placed on its spine. NASA sums up both SCA’s accomplishments as such: NASA 905 flew 70 of the 87 ferry missions during the operational phase of the shuttle program, including 46 of the 54 post-mission ferry flights from Dryden to the Kennedy Space Center. After the orbiters were retired, NASA 905 flew three ferry missions to deliver the shuttles Discovery, Enterprise, and Endeavour to museums where they are currently on display. Upon its retirement in late 2012, it had flown 11,018 flight hours over 42 years, both as a commercial jetliner and as a NASA space shuttle carrier, and had made 6,335 takeoffs and landings… … Upon its [#911] retirement on Feb. 8, 2012, it had amassed 33,004 flight hours over its 38-year flight career, including 386 flights as a NASA shuttle carrier aircraft, 66 of which were flights with a space shuttle mounted atop the fuselage. It flew 17 of the post-shuttle-landing ferry flights from Edwards to Kennedy. NASA 911 on the Dryden ramp not long before their retirement. , Tyler Rogoway/Author The only payload I know of SCAs carrying externally aside from the orbiters was Boeing’s X-45C Phantom Ray UCAV . #905 ferried it from St. Louis to Edwards AFB where it would be tested back in 2010. That was actually a far more involved mission than one may assume as strapping one plane to another is never a simple task, but the SCAs and the NASA-Phantom Works team got it done. Youtube GIF When I saw the SCAs up close just months before they were decommissioned, they were absolutely immaculate aircraft. They could have just rolled right off the production line they looked so fresh and clean. In terms of age and usage, neither could be considered extremely high-time when it comes to first generation 747s, but #905 was really a lightly used aircraft for its age. The SCAs amassed some pretty funny markings over the years., Rob Elliott/wikicommons But without a mission and NASA having another first generation 747 to support, not to mention the increasing costs and challenges of maintaining old 747s, by end of 2012, it was the SCA’s time to bow out of service. But what wonderful and effective machines they were, which could only have been the case due to the dedicated NASA employees who truly loved and babied these aircraft during the Shuttle’s reign. At least we still have mementos to remember the SCAs by like the amazing photograph by Carla Thomas that spurred this trip down aeronautical memory lane.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russians are operating their Tu-154M aircraft configured for surveillance flights sanctioned under the Open Skies Treaty that allows member countries to conduct surveillance flights over each other’s territory relatively unimpeded. The aircraft are equipped with imaging equipment with specific limitations and monitors from the country being surveilled are onboard the flights to make certain the party complies with the parameters of the treaty. This latest series of Russian Open Skies flights are being conducted out of Great Falls , Montana and are covering a slew of strategic points in the western part of the United States, including the highly secure Nellis Test and Training Range (NTTR) in southern Nevada, home of Area 51 . The mid-day flight on March 28th, 2019 appears to have originated out of Travis AFB, located near San Francisco, and continued on something of a highlights tour of American military installations in California and Nevada. It flew south over central California, passing near bases like Naval Air Station Lemoore and headed out over the Channel Islands. It then headed directly over Edwards AFB before meandering around Fort Irwin and on to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake before hooking a right and heading toward Creech AFB in Nevada. It then headed north, directly into the NTTR— the most secure airspace in the United States along with Washington, D.C. This is the medium altitude imaging portion of the flight that the Tu-154M flew. , Flightradar24 It flew directly over Edwards AFB., Flightradar24 Then to Fort Irwin and the National Training Center. , Flightradar24 It then headed up over Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. , Flightradar24 It then turned east and flew directly over Creech AFB, the heart of America’s unmanned aircraft operations. , Flightradar24 After it flew over Creech AFB, it headed up to Yucca Flat, where one of America’s nuclear weapons assembly plants is located, and a secretive airstrip that specializes in test flights of unmanned aircraft, as well as other sensitive Department Of Energy installations. It then headed over the pockmarked Nevada Test Site . Area 51 sits just to the east of this location. The aircraft’s panoramic cameras can collect fairly wide swathes of imagery along the Open Skies aircraft’s flight path. The voyage continued north, with Tonopah Test Range to the east, before heading northeast towards Salt Lake. It passed somewhat near Dugway Proving Grounds on its way back to Great Falls, but it’s not clear if the aircraft was collecting imagery at that time. If it was, it was doing so at double the altitude as before. The Tu-154 flew at an altitude of around 14,000 to 15,000 feet for the part of its trip over Nevada and California, before climbing out to above 30,000 feet after exiting the NTTR and heading back to its temporary base of operations in Great Falls. Flightradar24 Flightradar24 Flightradar24 A flight before this one saw the Tu-154 check out Salt Lake and Hill AFB, Las Vegas and Nellis AFB, pretty much all of San Diego, and up the Southern California coast, which has plenty of military bases and weapons storage areas. It then flew directly to Plant 42 in Palmdale before climbing up and heading to Travis AFB to land and refuel. These are Russia’s first Open Skies missions over the U.S. for the year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 9, 2019",F-35’s Most Sinister Capability Are Towed Decoys That Unreel From Inside Its Stealthy Skin,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the least talked about, but most potent capabilities that can enhance the survivability of a combat aircraft these days is the ability to deploy towed decoys. Often referred to as “little buddies” by the crews that bet their lives on them, they have existed in miniature form for over two decades on aircraft like the F-16C/D, B-1B, and F/A-18E/F, as well as foreign fighter aircraft. But most wouldn’t think such a system would be included in a 5th generation fighter that was designed from the ground up to evade enemy radars. This isn’t the case. Although it isn’t something touted by the manufacturer or its operators, the F-35 has this capability concealed beneath its curvaceous and stealthy skin. First off, you are probably thinking that the inclusion of such a system in the F-35’s design is a sign of weakness in its stealth capabilities. Maybe it could be framed in such a manner, but doing so really doesn’t do the topic justice and it wouldn’t be fair to the F-35 either. Stealth fighters, as we know them today, are not highly optimized to evade a broad range of radar types. Instead, they are optimized to give fire control radars used to actually engage targets, as well as detect them in many cases, a very tough time. The classic appendages of a fighter aircraft—nose, tail surfaces, exhaust nozzles, and even wings—do not lend themselves to broadband radio frequency low-observability, but they are conducive to maneuverability and speed. So, while aircraft like the F-35 are effective at hiding from the most threatening radar types, and especially when viewed by those sensors from certain aspects, with the frontal-hemisphere profile being most optimized, they are less adept from doing the same when it comes to radars operating at lower frequencies or when viewed from rearward angles. USN The fusion of information from many types of sensors’ dispersed over a wide area that make up an integrated air defense system also degrades a stealthy aircraft’s ability to remain undetected, although it is key to remember that detection does not equal the ability to engage with weapons that rely on higher-quality and persistent telemetry. So even though a stealthy aircraft may be detected momentarily or even fairly persistently, that does not mean it can be engaged by surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. The lack of broadband low observability, like that provided by stealthy subsonic flying-wing designs that have minimal smaller appendages and features, also puts a stealthy fighter at greater risk. No aircraft, not even one that is designed with broadband low-observability as the goal above all else, is totally invisible to radar and other sensors. Stealth means a reduced probability of detection and engagement, not invincibility. Careful route planning and high situational awareness of threats in an aircraft’s vicinity are also essential to the survivability of stealthy aircraft, with the goal being to only provide the most unfavorable (detectable) aspects of the aircraft to a threatening enemy’s sensor view for the least amount of time. F-35 fires an AIM-120 AMRAAM in testing. , USAF So, stealth is not some monolithic concept, it has many variables and degrees, and above all else, it relies on a cocktail of measures, with a low-observable design and radar-absorbent coatings being just some ingredients in that cocktail, albeit quite important ones. Other key aspects include reduced infrared signature and the ability to tightly control an aircraft’s own radio frequency emissions so as to not let the enemy know of its presence. Low probability of intercept (LPI) radars and radios allow for reduced chances of being detected while still offering key functionality. They use highly directional emissions, frequency hopping, and wavelength modulation, as well as other clandestine techniques, to allow their operations to remain undetected by the enemy’s surveillance equipment. All these features are very important, but one of the most essential ingredients in the success of any stealthy combat aircraft is electronic warfare. Electronic warfare paired with low observability is really a magic potion for survivability over the modern battlefield. Whatever weaknesses a stealthy aircraft has in its shaping and coatings can potentially be offset, to a certain degree, by the ability to wreak havoc on enemy radar and communications systems via electronic attacks. In the past, aircraft like the F-117 Nighthawk had zero electronic warfare capabilities as the technology to make such a system’s emissions undetectable and not self-defeating was very limited. Instead, those aircraft relied on jamming support from other aircraft, such as EF-111 Ravens and EA-6B Prowlers , operating at standoff ranges. In practice, it was very seldom that an F-117 would venture deep into denied territory without robust jamming support. In fact, the one time it did, during Operation Allied Force two decades ago, it was shot down. F-117 breaking away from the tanker. The aircraft would ‘clean up’ by retracting all its antennas and turning off anything that produces an RF emission before heading into contest territory. The F-117s were largely defenseless and blind to nearby threats and relied heavily on external jamming support. , USAF The F-35, on the other hand, is designed with its own highly-integrated, highly-advanced AN/ASQ-239 electronic warfare system. It takes advantages of its active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the antennas that are buried along the edges of its wings and control surfaces and beneath its skin. This capability allows the F-35 to ‘self-escort’ to the target area and back, taking on enemy emitters electronically that it may have trouble staying far enough away from to evade detection entirely. This same electronic warfare suite and the jet’s high degree of sensor fusion offers F-35 pilots the ability make rapid decisions regarding their survivability on the fly. They can decide to destroy threatening emitters that may pop-up in their way, and new weapons are being developed to do this quickly and over relatively long ranges, or to avoid the threat entirely if possible, or to try to blind and confuse it via electronic attacks, allowing the F-35 to sneak by unscathed. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MFWoYKkKFyE This electronic warfare capability gives the jet an enhanced degree of survivability and helps offset reliance on its low-observable design alone, which does have its weaknesses. Beyond being optimized to defeat higher-frequency fire control radars, like those that operate on and around the X band, the rear of the F-35 has been a bit controversial as its perceived radar cross-section is larger than some would like, possibly leaving it vulnerable to detection and even engagement from rear aspects. Quite honestly, I haven’t seen this really disputed, but as we discussed above, weaknesses in an aircraft’s low-observable design don’t mean it is totally vulnerable. While the F-35 may have shortcomings in terms of detectability to certain radars and from certain aspects, it seems Lockheed and their partners have come up with novel ways to help fill in the gaps. One of the Joint Strike Fighter’s tricks that has remained largely in the shadows is the inclusion of an internal towed decoy system—one that has “little buddies” that are wicked smart to boot. We know for a fact that the F-35 is capable of deploying a specially-built version of advanced electronic warfare-enabled towed decoy known as the ALE-70. The ALE-50 and electronic warfare-enabled ALE-55 are currently in service with the USAF and U.S. Navy. The first generation-variant of the ALE-50 towed decoy was unreeled out behind an aircraft and basically gave threatening air defense systems a much larger and more enticing target to attack than the host aircraft itself. As a result, the missile would home in on the decoy and blow it off its wire instead of destroying jet itself. During various operations, including the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the system worked incredibly well and clearly saved many lives and aircraft. Maybe the best look at the system in action was in Dan Hampton’s memoir Viper Pilot , which I highly suggest you read. ​ ​​​ Since then, little buddies have morphed from decoy target to advanced electronic warfare-enabled extensions of the plane’s own self-protection suite. The ALE-55 that is reeled out from the center of the Super Hornet’s belly is capable of jamming enemy emitters in an effort to keeping them from locking onto the aircraft, or directly executing electronic attacks on an emitter that has already locked on, or goading a missile into attacking it instead of the aircraft if an attack is already underway. ALE-55 system. , BAE Systems (main image), Wikicommons (inset) Sometimes these modes of operation are aptly referred to suppress, deflect, and seduce. This is done via a range of guileful electronic warfare programs the decoy can employ in concert with the jet’s self-defense suite. An aircraft-mounted control unit sends the specific signals to the decoy over a fiber-optic line. Once at the decoy, those signals are translated into radio frequency emissions. The ALE-50’s electronic systems were self-contained in the expendable decoy itself, making them far less capable. The towed fiber-optic decoy arrangement makes for a highly capable, fully tailorable, and rapidly adjustable response to a whole range of threats. For instance, the decoy can first try to generally jam a radar that is in search mode, then it can try to attack it directly to break its lock once it locks on. Then, if a missile locks on in flight, the decoy can instantly turn into a juicy target, or even targets, misdirecting the missile away from the aircraft. Concept art of a Hornet with ALE-50 in tow. , Raytheon Clearly, these “little buddies” are vicious, but beloved helpers to have along on a mission. Aircraft with ‘doghouses’ built-in to deploy these types of decoys usually carry between four and eight of depending on the design. Other aircraft, like the F-16, have the doghouses built into their weapons pylons. ALE-50 housing on a Block 50 F-16. , MKFI/wikicommons A version of the ALQ-184 electronic warfare pod also has towed decoys built in, offering a broader spectrum of tactics for protecting the aircraft it is attached to. ALQ-184 equipped with towed decoys. , Raytheon On the F-35, its ALE-70s seem to be deployed via a trapdoor that pops open on the right underside of its fuselage, aft of the weapons bay and infrared countermeasures doors. Supposedly, at least four ALE-70s can be carried at a time in the drop-down enclosure. The towed decoy deployment door is located just aft of the dual flip-open infrared countermeasures dispenser door. , Lockheed Martin This rare image appears to show the towed decoy door open. , unknown Budget documents not only confirm the ALE-70’s existence, but also the fact that it is accommodated internally on the F-35. A line item within the USAF’s 2017 budget states: “The ALE-70 Towed Decoy is a countermeasures dispenser system designed to fit into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft. The ALE-70 provides aircraft self-protection against radar guided missiles.” DoD ALE-70 is also listed in the Navy’s budget from the same year, along with the aircraft’s other countermeasures. It is worth noting that various flares and infrared countermeasures, as well as the ALE-70s, are the aircraft’s only listed expendable countermeasures. Chaff, which is used to blind and confuse enemy radar, is not included in the F-35’s countermeasures suite. This makes some sense as low-observability, the aircraft’s highly advanced and deeply integrated electronic warfare system, and the ALE-70 offers enhanced survivability against radar and radar-guided threats. Still, it is interesting that chaff was indeed omitted. The budget document reads: “F-35 COUNTERMEASURES: Includes all unique countermeasures that provide self-protection for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft, specifically ALE-70, MJU-68, MJU-69 and CCU-168. In addition to F-35unique countermeasures, MJU-61 and MJU-64 are also used for F-35 self-protection.” DoD We also have an updated unit cost for the ALE-70 from the Pentagon’s 2020 budget request, which comes in at $56,375. Not cheap, but hardly expensive compared to the loss of a $100M F-35 and its pilot. Considering the F-35’s already potent electronic warfare capabilities, you can just imagine how the advanced electronic-warfare capable towed decoy could be used by the jet in combat. If a radar system threatens the aircraft and it cannot be avoided via a course change or attacked directly, reeling out an ALE-70 would probably give the F-35 the best chances of survival, especially if a missile launch was already detected. The decoys could also help when it comes to mitigating the aircraft’s rear radar cross-section. As it flees from a target area, unwinding an ALE-70 would definitely give enemy radar operators a much harder task of successfully targeting the aircraft, let alone bringing it down. Also, when operating in a non-stealthy configuration with external stores, the advanced towed decoys will give the F-35 a means to better defend itself against pop-up threats, such as road-mobile surface-to-air missile systems or even enemy fighters. And above all else, towed decoys will be incredibly important when operating in the Wild Weasel role—the mission of taking on enemy air defenses directly—something the F-35 is supposed to be incredibly adept at already. An astute Wild Weasel F-35 driver could work with his or her wingmen to act as both the hunter and the prey. ALE-70s could be reeled out to turn one stealthy F-35 into the most enticing target imaginable for enemy air defenders. Meanwhile, another F-35, operating in full stealth mode, would be waiting to geolocate the enemy’s radar emissions once they take the bait. At which time that F-35 would proceed to pummel the threatening emitter or air defense system to death. USAF USAF F-16CJ Wild Weasel pilots were among the first to put the little buddy to work, they know full well how capable it is and how it could be used in concert with a stealthy airframe to really ruin an enemy radar operator’s day. This will allow F-35s to more easily clear a path for other assets, including older and more vulnerable 4th generation fighters and non-stealthy bombers, many of which also have their own towed decoys to watch their backs. The B-1B was one of the first aircraft to get towed decoys. Notice the doghouses on either side of the tail., Tyler Rogoway/Author Similar tactics can be used in the air-to-air arena, with the ALE-70 acting to sucker-in enemy fighters or to make phantom formations of aircraft appear on their radar scopes. Then, once they have committed to an engagement, the F-35 reels-in its decoy and disappears and the enemy fighters find themselves outflanked by other F-35s with missiles locked on and inbound. So, you can see just how awesome a feature this is to have built into a stealthy airframe. It offers maximum tactical flexibility, will keep the enemy guessing, and will even make them outright vulnerable without them ever knowing they had been had before it is too late. Above all else, it gives the F-35 another layer of protection that will keep it survivable even if its stealthy shape and radar-absorbent coatings become less effective on the battlefield in the decades to come. Little buddies—now quietly paling around with the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 5, 2019",Air Force Wanted To Turn Skunk Works’ Mach 3 Capable Recon Drone Into A Nuclear Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A newly declassified document shows that, during the Cold War, the U.S. military considered turning Lockheed’s D-21 Tagboard supersonic spy drone into an unmanned strike platform. The plan would have given the U.S. Air Force a high-speed, deep-penetrating, air-launched strike weapon and it’s a capability the service is still interested in acquiring today . In January 1971, John McLucas , then both Undersecretary of the Air Force and Director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), sent a memo to Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard about the armed D-21 proposal. NRO, the very existence of which remained classified until 1992, released this record and nearly 100 other documents related to the Tagboard program as part of its continued transparency efforts, on Mar. 21, 2019 . “With respect to your question about whether TAGBOARD should be considered as a drone/bomber, we have done some investigation and discussed this with the Air Staff and SAC [Strategic Air Command],” McLucas wrote. “I will be glad to do any additional analysis or other work which you might suggest.” A D-21 drone., USAF But Tagboard’s origins, and nearly two decades of development and operational activities up to that point, were rooted almost exclusively in intelligence collection. To rewind a bit, after the Soviet Union shot down Gary Powers flying a U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane over their territory in 1960, there was a considerable impetus to develop less vulnerable intelligence gathering assets that could penetrate far into denied areas with limited risk. Lockheed, which had designed and built the U-2, was already in the process of developing a successor, known as the A-12 Oxcart at the time. This aircraft subsequently evolved into the Air Force’s famous SR-71 Blackbird . SR-71s under construction., Lockheed The A-12 could fly at over three times the speed of sound at around 90,000 feet, but there were still reservations within the U.S. government about sending any manned aircraft on high-risk missions over hostile countries, such as the Soviet Union. At the same time, NRO was pushing ahead with the first generations of spy satellites , which, at the time, offered a way to spy on these areas with virtual impunity. The problem with early spy satellites was that they could only carry limited amounts of wet film, reducing their capacity to cover large areas and do so over a protracted period of time. In addition, they had limited repositioning flexibility once they entered their orbits. On top of all this, it was a complex process to prepare additional satellites for launch, making it difficult to ensure one was ready to go on short notice in response to new developments. A graphic describing the general features of the KH-4B Corona spy satellite, which NRO declassified more than a decade ago as part of a separate release of records. Note that this satellite, the first which the United States launched in 1967, still had an average mission life of fewer than 20 days.   , NRO So, the U.S. government had sought out additional alternative intelligence gathering platforms that were less vulnerable than manned aircraft, but more flexible than a satellite. The Central Intelligence Agency, which controlled the A-12 fleet, approached Lockheed and its Skunk Works advanced projects division in 1962 to ask for new options. One concept that Skunk Works proposed envisioned using a modified A-12 as a mothership to carry and launch a rocket booster with a small satellite on top into low orbit. You can read more about this project here . Another idea involved a modified A-12 as a launch platform for an air-breathing, high-altitude supersonic unmanned spy drone. CIA passed on this proposal, but NRO picked it up, ultimately giving the project the codename Tagboard. At that time, there were no plans to turn the unmanned aircraft into a strike platform. The delta-wing unmanned aircraft, constructed primarily of titanium, was more than 40 feet long and had a wingspan of 20 feet. A modified Marquardt RJ43 ramjet engine, also found on the CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile and AQM-60 Kingfisher target drone, could propel the D-21 to speeds over Mach 3 at altitudes of around 100,000 feet – higher than the A-12’s service ceiling. A declassified technical drawing of the D-21 drone., Lockheed via NRO Tagboard needed its modified two-seat A-12 motherships, which became known as M-21s, to get it to sufficiently high speed for the ramjet to operate efficiently. After release from the M-21, the drone would fly a pre-programmed route totaling more than 3,000 miles using an automated stellar navigation system, something you can read about more here . The drone carried a single Hycon HR 335 camera that could capture images of areas up to between 14 and 16 miles wide, depending on altitude, as it screamed across enemy territory. A declassified technical drawing of the M-21 mothership with the D-21 drone on top., Lockheed via NRO After conducting its mission, its route would take it back out to neutral territory, where it would eject the film canister, which would then deploy a parachute. The D-21 was not reusable and was configured to self-destruct after releasing its payload. A specially modified JC-130 Hercules cargo aircraft would snatch the film out of the air using a complex trapeze before reeling it in inside and transporting it back to base for processing. The Air Force, with the help the CIA and NRO, had devised this concept first in the 1950s to catch falling film pods that spy satellites released. This continued to be the standard practice for retrieving film and other data from satellites until technology had advanced to the point where it was practical to transmit imagery and other information wirelessly straight to a ground station. A JC-130 Hercules practices a maneuver to catch falling film canisters near Edwards Air Force Base in 1969., USAF Given Tagboard’s general performance characteristics and other features, it’s not hard to see how Strategic Air Command would have looked at the drone and seen a very viable weapons platform, and one that could help it maintain relevant in the age of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). If Tagboard could carry a camera and film along a specific route before releasing a film canister at a precise moment, it certainly could have carried a nuclear bomb and dropped it over a designated target area. By the late 1950s, it was already apparent to that American strategic bombers, the B-52 in particular, would be extremely vulnerable to Soviet air defenses and combat aircraft during an all-out conflict. As a result, the Air Force had already initiated work on an air-launched nuclear-tipped ballistic missile, GAM-87 Skybolt , and a long-range nuclear-armed cruise missile, the GAM-77 Hound Dog , as stand-off options for the B-52. The Hound Dog, which was supposed to be an interim weapon until the Skybolt was ready, had a maximum range of 785 miles and a top speed of just over Mach 2. The Skybolt could hit targets up to 1,150 miles away and, since it flew in a ballistic trajectory, would come screaming down on its targets at hypersonic speeds over Mach 12. Skybolt suffered significant delays in testing and, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy canceled the program in favor of a combination of submarine-launched Polaris ballistic missiles and land-based Minuteman ICBMs . Hound Dog, which had entered service in 1960, would remain operational until 1978. An armed version of Tagboard would have offered more than three times the range of Skybolt and be able to cover that distance at an even greater top speed. Without the need for the drone to return to a safe area to deposit the film canister, it could have struck targets out to its full range of more than 3,000 miles – far enough to hit Moscow from a launch point in the middle of the North Atlantic. Depending on the exact configuration of the weaponized drone, it could have possibly dropped multiple bombs at various points over a particular route. The Air Force could have simply employed it as more of a missile, carrying a single warhead straight to a target. A mix of both options might have allowed it to strike multiple objectives along the way to a final destination, where it would have detonated one last warhead. In addition, just as Tagboard was more flexible than launching spy satellites, a “bomber” version of the drone, which was how NRO Director McLucas described it to Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard, would have offered many of those same advantages over IBCMs. The unmanned aircraft’s high speed could have made it useful for striking time-sensitive targets at shorter ranges, as well. The launching aircraft would have retained all of the benefits a bomber brings to the table, too. These include the ability to fly on alert closer to the target area during a crisis, offering a visible deterrent whether it launches its payload or not. Bombers are also easier to recall than a ballistic missile, able to fly right to the edge of enemy air space before having to release an actual weapon, giving commanders more time to respond to new developments and potentially abort the mission. All of this remains the case today and are among the main arguments for keeping the B-52H in service through 2050. Unfortunately, Tagboard and its M-21 motherships quickly proved to be complex and finicky. The physical interactions between the M-21 and the D-21, which the manned aircraft carried on top of its fuselage, were downright dangerous. An M-21 carrying a D-21 during a flight test., USAF In the first test flight of the M-21/D-21 combination on Mar. 5, 1966, the drone remained worryingly close to the mothership aircraft after release before flying away safely. The next two tests involved uneventful separations, even though the drone malfunctioned later in its flight in both cases. The fourth test on July 30, 1966 came to a tragic end when the D-21 suffered an engine problem during release, struck the tail end of the M-21 as it fell away, and destroyed both aircraft in the process. Pilot Bill Park and Launch Control Officer Ray Torrick ejected as their plane went crashing into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Park survived, but Torrick unfortunately drowned. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9u7VnAkWvMY Lockheed Skunk Works’ legendary boss Kelly Johnson was so distraught over the accident, he initially refused to work on the program any further and offered to refund the money the U.S. government had already paid. However, NRO and others insisted on continuing the program, so Johnson offered to mate the D-21 to an alternative launch platform, a B-52H bomber. The resulting configuration consisted of a B-52H fitted with two heavy pylons , on under each wing, similar to the ones the bombers used to carry Hound Dog missiles, but each carrying a single D-21 instead. Since the lumbering bombers couldn’t reach supersonic speeds themselves, Lockheed modified the drones to incorporate a rocket booster to propel them before the ramjet could take over. These new D-21Bs also had a command self-destruct feature, in case of a serious malfunction. A B-52H carries a pair of D-21B drones on its underwing pylons., USAF A close up of a D-21B under the wing of a B-52H., USAF The Air Force stood up the 4200th Support Squadron at Area 51 to support the initial test program, which involved six test flights, between January and June 1968, nicknamed Captain Hook I through VI, according to a now declassified history of the unit that NRO released. On Nov. 9, 1969, a B-52H flying from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam launched the first operational D-21B mission, which sent the drone flying over China’s Lop Nor nuclear test site, as part of Project Senior Bowl. A grainy shot of a D-21B with its booster still attached after launch., NRO That drone never returned, reportedly flying on into the Soviet Union and crashing. In February 1970, the 4200th conducted another test flight, nicknamed Long Drive, on the Pacific Missile Range off Hawaii to validate a number of fixes. After that, there were three more Senior Bowl missions over China. Of the two that actually returned as planned, both experienced issues with releasing the film canisters, which were subsequently lost. On the final operational flight, on Mar. 20, 1971, the drone crashed inside China. The remnants are now on display in that country. The remains of the D-21 that crashed in southern China on display in that country., N Ezov via Wikimedia By January 1971, when NRO Director McLucas responded to Deputy Defense Secretary Packard’s inquiry, there was clearly a growing disappointment with Tagboard, as well as its cost. In his memo, McLucas noted that each Tagboard drone, of which there around 20 at the time, had cost $2.5 million – more than $15 million in today’s dollars, but still cheaper than the cost of the latest iterations of the MQ-9 Reaper – and that he wasn’t sure exactly how much more it would take to convert them into a strike platform. The exact cost of the program remains unclear, especially since it included funding from various black budgets, but reportedly would have been valued in the billions in present-day dollars. Regardless, Packard was clearly struck by these figures. “Johnny, you have answered my question,” he hand-wrote on the memo in return. “This cost is too high – it is probably too high even for [its] present mission.” The full memo from NRO Director John McLucas to Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard, with Packard’s handwritten response., NRO The armed Tagboard drone never came to be. The Nixon Administration canceled the entire program in July 1971. The 17 remaining D-21s went into storage first at Norton Air Force Base in California and then at the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, where they became visible to the public. The program remained officially classified until the 1980s. Today, there are 12 D-21s on display, 11 in the United States and the one in China. The sole surviving M-21 mothership is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle Washington. A surviving D-21 on display., Alan Wilson via Wikimedia It’s important to note that even as the D-21 program was getting underway, the Air Force was already beginning to very seriously investigate radar-evading stealth technology . As those efforts progressed and general concept became more viable in the 1970s, stealth steadily replaced speed as the primary means of penetrating an enemy’s air defense network. But the general concept behind the D-21 has lived on in many ways. In the 2000s, Skunk Works worked with the U.S. Navy to design an advanced supersonic cruise missile as part of the Revolutionary Approach To Time Critical Long Range Strike ( RATTLRS ) program. The resulting BGM-178 missile was very reminiscent of the D-21. It featured a Rolls Royce YJ102R turbojet engine, a high-axial flow design that would have been able to propel the weapon, armed with a penetrating high explosive warhead or a payload of small submunition bomblets, to speeds around Mach 4. This means it could have reached its maximum range of more than 500 miles in around 30 minutes. A mockup of the BGM-178 RATTLRS missile., ONR via F-16.net Similar to how an armed D-21 might have operated, the Navy envisioned RATTLRS as a sea-launched weapon that would have been able to penetrate deep into denied areas and do so quickly in order to be able to strike time-sensitive targets on short notice. This program disappeared from the public eye at the end of the 2000s before any flight tests occurred, but the missile’s development may have, at least, helped inform the development of a more advanced and top-secret supersonic weapon, known as Sea Dragon, which you can read about more here . But whatever happened to RATTLRS, the demand for improved capabilities to allow the U.S. military to hit critical targets at extended ranges quickly hasn’t dissipated. Quite the opposite has happened and there has been an explosion of interest in hypersonic aircraft and missile designs as of late. Even the B-52 is being eyed again as the ideal vehicle to haul and launch outsized high-speed missiles, much like how it was used for the D-21 program. At the same time, potential American opponents, especially Russia and China, have been hard at work developing improved radars and other sensors so that they can detect and possibly engage stealth aircraft. This has only further placed a renewed premium on speed, not just to be able to hit targets promptly, but in order to reduce the vulnerability of aircraft and missiles to enemy air defenses in the process. So, while the D-21 never achieved success in the intelligence gathering role, and never transformed into a strike platform, it certainly helped blaze the trail for new developments that we may come to fruition in the near future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The photo above was taken at the height of the Cold War inside one of nearly two dozen Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Direction Centers that dotted the United States and Canada. The room seen here, nicknamed the Blue Room for obvious reasons, was one of many built inside the nuclear-fortified block houses that were really an elaborate and, at the time absolutely cutting-edge, weapon system in their own right. The oversized computer hardware, blinking lights and moody lighting, large projection systems, and austere bunker atmosphere influenced pop culture and science fiction heavily during SAGE’s heyday, which ran from 1959 through 1984. SAGE was the eyes and brains of North American Air Defense Command’s (NORAD) strategic mission having the job of detecting and directing the response to an incoming armada of nuclear bomb laden Soviet bombers. By default, it also kept tabs on air traffic around North America. The system was amazing advanced for its time, running on huge mainframe computers that were interlinked to radar stations, radar picket ships, and airborne early warning aircraft, as well as surface-to-air missile and aircraft interceptor sites. Not long after its founding, SAGE gained the ability to remotely take control of surface-to-air missiles and interceptor aircraft, some of them nuclear armed, to prosecute incoming targets largely on its own. But it still was 1950s computer technology that ran on constant streams of punch cards and outputted teletype instructions. As such, even though it was highly automated for its age, it was also extremely labor intensive. DoD The system was also tied into a handful of master Combat Centers that could unilaterally direct North America’s entire air defense system during a conflict, as well as the Pentagon’s own nerve center , and NORAD headquarters. So, we are really talking about one of the first fully integrated data networks that spanned thousands of miles, as well as the dawn of what we know now as sensor fusion and an integrated air defense system (IADS). DoD At the heart of each SAGE Direction Center was an enormous IBM AN/FSQ-7 duplex computer, taking up a whole level of the bunker structure—roughly 22,000 square feet—and made up of a whopping 49,000 vacuum tubes. It is also still the largest single computer system ever built. This computer fused all the radar and other telemetry data from disparate remote sensors together to create common, relatively accurate radar tracks of targets and would even recommend the best response to them if they were deemed hostile based on the nearest air defense assets, those assets’ real-time status, and their varying capabilities. The duplex arrangement meant that one of the computers was always double checking the primary one and would instantly take over full functionality if the lead computer had any sort of technical difficulties. SAGE Direction Center in Duluth, MN and the AN/FSQ-7 mainframe modules. , DoD The Direction Center bunker installations were built to withstand the pressure from nearby thermonuclear warheads detonating and were hardened from the effects of electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) as they had to continue operating even though what could have potentially been the beginning of the end of human civilization. This was all part of a deterrent strategy that was one abstract aspect of the complex and hugely expensive SAGE system. The foreboding-looking Direction Centers were high security, windowless, concrete and steel facilities made up of four floors. The first housing the mechanical and electrical systems and the heavy cooling systems needed to keep all that archaic computer technology running and the bunker’s inhabitants alive and communicating to the outside world. The second floor was where the massive AN/FSQ-7 was installed and maintained. DoD The third floor contained offices and store rooms, as well as the Sector Command Post. This was also a very sci-fi looking feature that inspired sets used in films and television shows for decades. It included a pit-like theater area where a large projection screen displayed a ‘big board’ that showed the air defense ‘picture’ over an entire geographical region. A cutting-edge Kelvin-Hughes projector was used for the big situational display. DoD Around the pit was seating for a command staff to oversee the status of the region at any given time and to make decisions based on the info fed into the projector, which itself was made up of ever-changing data being produced by the computer and a small army of radar operators housed on the level above, as well as a support staff that worked tirelessly to translate critical info into visual form. The corded gun you see the officer holding is either a form of long-distance light pen device or a very early version of a laser pointer. I have been told by two people that it was a laser pointer, but I haven’t been able to confirm it with a primary source. , USAF ISBM The fourth floor is where the Blue Room photo was taken. Here is where all the information the computer fused was shown to radar and weapons control operators. Everything from threat discrimination and identification, to actually ordering or even controlling the employment of surface-to-air missiles and interceptor aircraft occurred on this level. It was from this information, much of which was filtered by the human operators, that those down in the Sector Command Post could make decisions.

The light pens could designate/select targets to allow them to be classified and tracked. IBM Check out these awesome atomic age videos explaining SAGE and its incredibly complex functionality. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_qq-SX9KEkw https://youtube.com/watch?v=csO5oBI6ZQg SAGE, which did get critical upgrades throughout its lifetime, has been gone for 35 years, and it is far cry from the office-like settings we see Air Force air defense operators working at today. The abilities that NORAD has presently seem lightyears ahead of SAGE, especially when it comes to automation and the streamlining of user interfaces, let alone the amount of data available at what amounts to a desktop computer workstation. But knowing that makes SAGE all that more jaw dropping technologically speaking. Despite all the computers, the system was run by people. Lots and lots of people, including civilian contractors, some of which were women. It was not glamorous or particularly engaging work by any means. Basically, you were trapped in a fortified prison all day with no natural light and surrounded by buzzing and blinking computer gear. Considering the very nature of its utility—to repel a Soviet nuclear strike—not a whole lot happened outside of exercises, issues with airliners, and enemy training sorties skimming the SAGE network’s sensor perimeter. But that was the point. SAGE’s existence was all about not having to realize its fullest combat potential. In that way it worked marvelously. So, here’s to all the Americans and Canadians who spent large parts of their lives keeping an eye on the skies over North America from their futuristic, computer-stuffed, concrete cubes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 2, 2019",Trump “Had Never Seen Anything Like” His Secretive Flight To Iraq Aboard Air Force One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are learning more about President Trump’s short trip to Al Asad Air Base in Western Iraq now that Air Force One is safely at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. This includes an account of the flight from Trump himself. While fielding questions at the U.S. military forward operating location, Trump was asked if he had concerns about the trip. Here is how he replied: “Absolutely. When I heard what ya had to go through. I mean look, I had concerns for the institution of the presidency, because, not for myself personally, I had concerns for the first lady, I will tell you. But if you would have seen what we had to go through, with the darkened plane with all windows closed, with no lights on whatsoever, anywhere, pitch black, I’ve never seen that, been on many airplanes, all types and shapes and sizes, I’ve never seen anything like it. We’re coming in and I know all of the things that were surrounding us for safety. So did I have a concern? Yeah I had a concern. But my bigger concern was maybe the people that were with me. Certainly all of them. Except maybe John Bolton. He’s a pretty tough guy, he can handle it. Right John? John Can handle it.” See the exchange here: What Trump is referring to is the tactical approach and measures used by Air Force One’s crew to access Al Asad Air Base safely. This would have involved flying the approach totally lights out, likely using a corkscrewing or steep tactical approach method. Many of the lights at the base may have also been turned off during Air Force One’s recovery and helicopters would have been in the air patrolling the sprawling base’s borders and commandos would have been ready to execute combat search and rescue operations if something bad were to have happened to the iconic aircraft and its occupants. Surveillance aircraft would have been airborne sucking up any communications intelligence from nefarious actors that may have been tipped off to Air Force One’s arrival or presence at the base. Fighter aircraft would have also provided escort and combat air patrol duties over the area. This could have included flying alongside Air Force One during its approach to act as heat traps . Tyler Rogoway/Author Since the Global War on Terror kicked off following 9/11, Air Force One’s crews—the best the USAF has to offer—have gotten real world experience in executing these types of operations, most famously with George W. Bush flying to Baghdad in 2003. Many others trips to Afghanistan and Iraq followed over the years and across both the Bush and Obama Presidencies. This is an excellent documentary. Start at 31:00 for a good idea of exactly what an operation like this looks like: Some may question why Air Force One, hardly an inconspicuous aircraft, was used for this sensitive mission. The VC-25A is the most heavily self-defended transport aircraft in the world by a large margin. It has been upgraded with many AN/AAQ-24 Directed Infrared Countermeasure (laser) turrets and also packs the AN/AAQ-204 Matador infrared countermeasure system that was installed when the aircraft were first delivered decades ago. So for the primary threat, shoulder-fired heat seeking missiles, also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), no aircraft on earth is better suited at countering it. Matador installations seen in this image in their trailing-edge engine pylon mounting position. Another is located above the APU on the tail., Tyler Rogoway/Author Air Force One is also substantially faster than a C-17—another good attribute to have when flying into sensitive airspace. Still, a C-17 could be a low-profile alternative option when packing a ‘Silver Bullet’ VVIP system which you can read all about here . A C-32A, commonly referred to as Air Force Two, is outfitted with similar defensive systems as a VC-25A, albeit on a smaller scale, but using it would inject more risk when flying into an airfield where MANPADS are a major threat due to it being a twin-engine design. Beyond those traits, the VC-25A packs the necessary communications needed to keep the President in secure contact with the National Command Authority if need be and pretty much anyone else on the planet, It also possesses substantial comfort, includes its own surgical room, and a host of other unique capabilities that allow its crew to make major changes to their route and general flight plan on the fly. This includes a special fourth crew position for advanced navigation and real-time flight planning. The aircraft is also aerial refueling capable , adding to its flexibility during contingency operations. So basically, it may be big and very recognizable, but the VC-25A is by far the best aircraft for the job. And once all the lights go out, its high-profile visual appearance becomes far less of a handicap. Twitter Screencap Also of note in new video coming out from the visit, is a group of Navy SEALs that took photos with the President while decked out in combat gear. SEALs have been highly active in Iraq since ISIS blitzed across the northern portion of the country years ago. The special operators did not have their faces covered or obscured in any of the official media imagery that has been released, which has led to concerns by some over the White House’s adherence to operational security protocols. It’s worth noting that special operators have been photographed in the field on many occasions in recent years. Regardless, it had to have been a cool experiencing for the men and women in uniform to meet the President in a remote operating area like Al Asad Air Base. It is a bit odd that Air Force One is returning home after just three hours in Iraq and not heading to an established base like Al Udeid in Qatar and/or Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan where Trump could meet with more troops and receive briefings from commanders on the ground there. We will keep you up to date as more info about Trump’s first trip to a conflict zone emerge.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020","Trump Said He Found The Greatest Room He’d Ever Seen Deep In The Pentagon, Here’s What He Meant","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 45th President of this great nation was on quite a roll yesterday during an exchange with the press that was part of a public portion of a cabinet meeting at the White House. There were some very interesting statements to unpack, to say the least, from a disjointed lesson on Russia’s failed excursion in Afghanistan to questionable proclamations regarding ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis’s tenure in Trump’s administration. But one part was especially interesting. Trump described a meeting with a large group of the military’s leadership in an ‘incredible’ technology-packed room at the Pentagon. What he was very likely describing is the seldom talked about and even less photographed National Military Command Center (NMCC). Trump stated: “When I became President, I had a meeting at the Pentagon with lots of generals. They were like from a movie. Better looking than Tom Cruise and stronger. And I had more generals than I’ve ever seen, and we were at the bottom of this incredible room. I said ‘this is greatest room I’ve ever seen.’ I saw more computer boards than I think that they make today.” You can watch his statement for yourself in the video below at time index 18:45: Considering Donald Trump’s penchant for absolutely over-the-top ballrooms and living spaces, calling a bunker buried dozens of feet below the Pentagon “the greatest room I have ever seen” is really something. But it isn’t surprising that the NMCC would be highly impressive to Trump or anyone else that has no idea it even exists. Basically, this facility was designed as a highly secure and command and control complex that serves as the nerve center and brain of the Pentagon, and by default, of the Department of Defense’s sprawling National Military Command System (NMCS) as a whole. This is the facility that contains the war rooms that have been notoriously over-hyped by Hollywood over the decades, including the iconic set used in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove. The War Room set in Dr. Strangelove. , Colombia Pictures The NMCC is a product of the early nuclear age. It was built out of the Joint War Room that preceded it during the Kennedy Administration. Till this very day, the facility directly supports the National Command Authority and its ability to rapidly order-up nuclear attacks. As such, the amazing communications capabilities the facility has at its disposal are really its greatest asset. Beyond connecting the National Command Authority during a crisis, the NMCC also issues the Emergency Action Messages (EAMS) that go out to bomber units, nuclear ballistic missile submarines, and ICBM missile silos scattered throughout the central United States, as well as the command and control aircraft that also support these delivery systems and the National Military Command System overall. These EAMs can quickly start or avert the end of the world as we know it. In addition, early warning and command and control nodes scattered around the globe are also linked into the NMCC, allowing it to share a common situational ‘picture’ with other command centers, and most importantly, with Strategic Command’s bunker at its headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. This makes it possible for fast-moving events, like potential enemy missile attacks, to be reacted to in a coordinated manner even though the principals involved with deciding how to respond may be separated by thousands of miles. As such, its existence serves as a key cornerstone of America’s nuclear deterrent. Beyond its Cold War-esque nuclear role, the NMCC also has many other functions. These include monitoring world events in real time and consolidating important and actionable intelligence and conveying that intelligence to commanders in near real-time for potential exploitation or just to provide enhanced situational awareness. This also works hand-in-hand with the facility’s crisis management capabilities. The NMCC is primarily where the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs would run the Pentagon during a major emergency that could last for a prolonged period of time. In this sense, it actually has a wartime tactical command and control capability, as well. But really, when we talk about the NMCC, it isn’t just one main war room, it is a labyrinth of rooms spread out over a number of levels buried below the Pentagon. A handful of primary areas are known to exist. These include the Current Actions Center (CAC), which provides command and control of ongoing military activities and monitoring of worldwide events in real time. This facility has much in common with today’s tactical operations centers and combined air operations centers overseas. The CAC circa 1970s and 1980s. Just imagine what it looks like now in the information age!, National Archives The Joint Chiefs Of Staff Conference Room is known more commonly by its nickname, “The Tank.” This extremely secure vault of a meeting space, basically a moderately decorated Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF) , is used by the military’s top leadership to openly discuss highly classified and sensitive subjects, which can include wartime decisions. No notes are taken in this room and no recordings are made of what is discussed within its four walls. This is literally a safe space for the top rungs of the Pentagon’s military leadership to hash out the services’ most pressing issues. The Tank., Globalsecurity.org The Emergency Conference Room (ECR) is very much a ‘war room’ as we understand the concept from Hollywood. This is where principals and their aides meet for high-level military discussions and briefings. These can include critical meetings and command and control operations during an ongoing crisis. This auditorium-like room is dominated by a huge conference table with built-in communications terminals and supported by large-scale multi-media projection. The ECR in the 1980s. , National Archives ECR in the 1980s. , National Archives National Archives This room and the CAC are what the President was most likely talking about yesterday. It is customary for Presidents to get tours of these facilities and to get acclimated to them very early on in their first term. They are likely to continue to receive briefings at the NMCC throughout their Presidency, although this is somewhat dependent on their management style. The NMCC has been used to brief Presidents on ongoing operations and military issues for decades. Here Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld walks with President George W. Bush towards the main entrance to the facility in 2003 just before Bush received a regular briefing. , USN There are many other spaces that make up the NMCC as well. These include smaller secure briefing and operations rooms, including those for each of the services, data and communications centers, and a large-scale intelligence fusion cell. The Cold War-era hotline between Washington D.C. and Moscow is also located in the NMCC. Operations Deputy’s Conference Room in the NMCC., National Archives The Pentagon’s elaborate command and control capabilities are duplicated multiple times over in various formats, and for good reason. The bunker isn’t likely to survive a major nuclear exchange. Really, no place is truly safe if the enemy wants to dedicate enough megatonnage to it as a target. So, during a full-force nuclear attack, when dozens of thermonuclear warheads would pummel the Pentagon, this facility’s main job would be to get the orders to counter-strike out before those warheads arrive. It is a dastardly grim thing to comprehend, but it is the nature of the deterrent’s original architecture and purpose—to execute the Single Integrated Operations Plan (SIOP) no matter what. Without potential enemies being absolutely certain that a counterstrike could occur, the deterrent’s effectiveness drops dramatically. The primary backup operations site for the Pentagon is known as Raven Rock, or Site-R. It’s buried very deeply under a mounted near Blue Ridge Summit in Pennsylvania. This is where the DoD’s Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC) is located. This installation duplicates the NMCC’s capabilities as well as other Pentagon functions. It remains semi-operational at all times, ready to take over for its far higher-profile cousin should it evaporate in a nuclear strike or be forced offline in any other catastrophe. In addition, the USAF’s four E-4B National Airborne Operation Center (NAOC) aircraft have many of the NMCC’s baseline capabilities—and in some cases additional ones as well—all shrunk into a 747-200 airframe. The Navy’s E-6B TACAMO aircraft also have some similar functions , although they are not primarily meant to fly the National Command Authority and key members of their staff during a crisis. Other U.S. military command sites can also support the DoD’s continuity of government operations during a crisis, as well. Although we know many things about the NMCC, we really don’t have any imagery of it from the post-internet boom age. Pretty much everything available is from the mid-1990s or long before. In fact, this network news segment with Joan Lunden from the mid-1990s is the latest and best imagery I could find showing some of the NMCC’s elements: We do know that the NMCC sprang into action as the horrible events of 9/11 unfolded and continued to operate even after American Airlines Flight 77 plowing into one of the pentagon-shaped building’s sides. Back in 2007,  Colonel John Brunderman, Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisitions, gave a talk at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst about his experiences in the NMCC on that tragic day. It is an outstanding account not just of how things unfolded, but also of the critical capabilities the NMCC’s provides during a crisis: Colonel Brunderman was working in the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. He shared his experiences from that day with those present at the Daedalian meeting. “We normally hear from World War II pilots and their war experience in the air, but this is a unique opportunity to hear some ground-war stories,” Lt. Col. Joseph Wolfer, 6th Airlift Squadron commander, said as he introduced Colonel Brunderman. According to Colonel Brunderman, the NMCC functions as the top of the pyramid for all command posts around the world. The NMCC staff provides continuous operation monitoring, reporting, training, maintenance management, and coordination for all communications-electronics activities and systems supporting the NMCC to ensure minimum essential National Military Command System connectivity for the Single Integrated Operational Plan execution, worldwide situation monitoring and crisis management. “The first indication was news reports of an explosion at one of the World Trade Towers,” Colonel Brunderman said. “We saw pictures of smoke coming out of the building against a clear blue sky backdrop, and we began immediate notification of a potential terrorist attack. While doing that, we saw live coverage of the second airplane hit the tower. In an instant, the attitude and energy changed to ‘Oh my gosh, the United States is under attack.'” On any given day there are 500 to 1,000 threat warnings, said Colonel Brunderman, but only a small percentage of those actually happen. “It’s hard to capture and explain the fog and friction of war,” he said. “When you’re looking for things that are abnormal, a lot of things appear abnormal.” While responding to the attacks on the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, where the NMCC is located, was attacked itself. Due to their location in the Pentagon, staff at the NMCC did not feel the impact, but Colonel Brunderman took the call notifying the NMCC that there had been an explosion at the Pentagon. “The NMCC never evacuated,” he said. “We were given paint masks and water because the smoke had penetrated the whole building.” Not only did Colonel Brunderman not evacuate, he ended up working 16 hours that day. The NMCC staff continued to work 12-hour shifts for the next eight months. “One of the proudest moments I have from that day was with all the chaos; you know you train for this everyday, it was amazing to see how quickly everything switched to a different mode. Everything went pretty much as it’s supposed to.” Although things went as practiced, there were some bumps and challenges along the way. “You find out all sorts of stuff when you’re actually doing things rather than practicing.” One such example was the increase in Defense Condition. DEFCONs are a very deliberate process, explained Colonel Brunderman. Normally, emerging conditions are taken into consideration and it could take days, if not weeks, to change the DEFCON. That was not the case on Sept. 11. “The Secretary of Defense walked into the NMCC and the acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, ‘Sir, I think we need to go to DEFCON 3,'” Colonel Brunderman recalled. “The SECDEF said that he concurred and to execute. In about 30 seconds we went from peacetime to DEFCON 3.” The attacks of Sept. 11 may have taken some people by surprise, but it is for incidents like this that the military trains and exercises the way it does. “Overall, I think the military performed extremely well for a bolt out of the blue incident, which is what this was.” The ECR circa the mid-1970s., DoD After the chaos of 9/11, it became glaringly clear that major investment into America’s aging command and control architecture was direly needed. America’s continuity of government plans and the facilities and communications capabilities that support them went through a relatively drastic overhaul. Maybe the best examples of this are the ongoing communications upgrades to Air Force One and the entirely new and quite huge bunker built deep below the White House lawn to replace, or at least drastically augment, the decades-old and very inadequate President Emergency Operations Center (PEOC). You can read all about both of these bunkers in this past feature of mine . It is certain that the NMCC has gone through a dramatic technological transformation compared to how we see it in the pictures and video in this post. In fact, large and elaborate top-level command control facilities are very hot acquisition items among America’s most powerful rivals in recent years. Both Russia and China have invested heavily in this space and have publicized these facilities to a fairly astonishing degree. A news clipping from 1971 detailing plans to renovate the NMCC.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Trump’s semi-secret trip aboard Air Force One to Iraq has grabbed many headlines this week. The iconic plane’s special flight into Iraq, which was recounted quite dramatically by the President himself, reminded me of a far more intense incident that occurred 45 years ago in the skies over Syria—an obscure event in aviation and U.S. presidential history that few seem to know even occur. During the Nixon Administration, back in 1974, it was decided that the President would attempt to open up better relations with Syria. In true Nixon fashion, he took to the skies aboard Air Force One—Boeing VC-137Cs at the time—to travel to Syria to meet with President Hafez Al Assad face-to-face as part of a multi-leg trip through the Middle East. A number of geopolitical events precipitated this historic diplomatic encounter. In 1967, U.S.-Syrian relations were put on ice following the Six Day War , but The Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria that was signed in May of 1974 allowed for high-level diplomatic ties between Washington D.C. and Damascus to be restored. There were high hopes in the Nixon Administration that a stronger relationship between the two often at odds countries could drastically cool tensions in the region and lead to a longer-lasting peace between Israel and Syria, as well as some of its other Arab neighbors. On June 15, 1974, with the stage set for a historic detente, Air Force One approached Syrian borders on its way to Damascus for the highly anticipated visit. As the VC-137 passed into Syrian airspace, four camouflaged MiGs appeared seemingly out of nowhere and began forming-up off Air Force One’s wing. Air Force One’s captain immediately acted to defend the iconic aircraft and its high-profile passengers. Nixon aboard Air Force One. , George Mason University Air And Space Magazine describes the strange encounter as such : Air Force One pilot Colonel Ralph D. Albertazzie, who, fearing attack, banked violently right. For the next seven minutes , Albertazzie flew a series of evasive maneuvers, including a steep dive. Remembering the incident years later to reporter Kenneth Walsh, author of Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes , CNN political analyst David Gergen, at the time a Nixon aide who was on Air Force One, said he wondered if the passengers would survive. He and others had been thrown to the floor. VC-137C Cockpit, AOPA The whole incident was a big and dangerous misunderstanding. White House officials already in Damascus had been told that the Syrian Air Force had planned to give Air Force One and honorary escort as it crossed into its territory, but nobody had informed Air Force One’s crew about the high-flying welcome wagon of sorts. After attempting to evade being shot down by the MiGs for seven long minutes—pushing the Boeing 707 derivative to the edge of its envelope and probably beyond—air traffic controllers informed Air Force One that the MiGs were not hostile and were there just as a formality as described to the White House advance party. One of the long-serving and very historic VC-137C that served multiple presidents. , USAF The flight continued on to land safely in Damascus where Nixon was treated to a full state welcome on the tarmac. A New York Times article published the following day describes the reception: When Mr. Nixon’s plane landed here in the late afternoon, he was given a 21‐gun salute. The road leading into Damascus was lined with soldiers in camouflaged combat uniforms and with fixed bayonets. The Golan Heights could be seen in the golden haze to the right as the limousine drove out of the airport. Nixon and Assad meet on the tarmac in Damascus after a harrowing ordeal in the skies. , National Archives Nixon never publically recounted the terrifying moments in the sky that day, but he had privately told reporter and author Kenneth Walsh that it really did scare him. As for the diplomatic mission, both leaders made official statements about their high expectations for a new era in relations between the two countries during the visit: In an exchange of remarks after dinner, President Assad told Mr. Nixon, as had the other Arab leaders this week, that the chances of peace depend on a just settlement of the Palestinian question. “The only lasting and durable peace in this region would be a peace that would terminate Israeli occupation, restore the land to its people, remove the grievances inflicted upon the people of Palestine and assure them of legitimate national rights.” He then told Mr. Nixon that his visit “will mark the beginning of a new phase of relations between our two countries, a phase based on mutual respect, unselfish cooperation and adherence to provisions of the United Nations Charter.” Mr. Nixon, noting that he was the first United States President to visit Syria, said in his reply that although he did not bring “any instant solution” to the Middle East, “I can tell you that the United States is committed irrevocably to working for a just and equitable solution.” Sadly, stable, long-term, and highly-productive relations between Syria and the United States would never come to pass. In the current decade, under the purview of Hafez Al Assad’s son, Bashar Al Assad, Syria has descended into civil war and now a long list of factions has their fingers in the conflict and in Syria’s uncertain future. But one thing is certain, those MiG pilots got one hell of a bizarre air show by surprise in the skies over Syria on that hopeful day in June nearly half a century ago.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Origins Of Stealth Black Hawks Date Back Over Three Decades Before The Bin Laden Raid,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are few defense or aviation stories as enigmatic as the mystery surrounding the highly modified H-60 Black Hawks that were used during the operation to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden. Most remain perplexed that the helicopters not only emerged out of virtually nowhere, but that they also disappeared back into the deeply classified world even after becoming a very publicly known component of the historic raid. Although there are various claims as to their origins and the timeline of their development, in this War Zone feature, we have official documentation that clearly shows the development of a stealthy Black Hawk began way farther back than anyone has claimed. The stealth Black Hawk and Bin Laden raid story helped launch my career to a certain extent. To this day, as far as I can tell, I was the first person who went on the record stating that the chopped-off tail left over from the helicopter that crashed inside Bin Laden’s compound in the wee hours of May 2nd, 2011 was not that of any known American helicopter, or one of any other national origin for that matter. Over the years that followed, I continued to report on any new details about the ‘Stealth Hawks’ and their shadowy past. This included everything from originally proving the carcass left behind was, in fact, an H-60 derivative, to how creative ground lighting was used to mask the helicopters’ uniqueness while staging out of Jalalabad Airfield in Afghanistan, to how communications jamming equipment wasn’t installed on the helicopters due to weight issues, and pretty much everything in-between. My last installment dates back to October of 2015 when I related some of the claims in Sean Naylor’s book on special operations Relentless Strike , a read I highly recommend incidentally. We will get to some of the information in that book in a bit. ​ ​​​ Since then, there has been no new credible information or sightings of the Stealth Hawks or even of their possible successors. Literally, the trail had gone cold. That is until I came upon a 1978 report worked up by Sikorsky for the U.S. Army Research and Technology Laboratory at Fort Eustis in Virginia— the same place where the Army cooks up its dream flying machines and capabilities to this very day. The report is titled Structural Concepts And Aerodynamic Analysis For Low Radar Cross Section (LRCS) Fuselage Configurations . Sounds boring and general enough, right? Well, it is anything but. The 139-page report outlines in great detail how Sikorsky could turn one of its new UH-60 Black Hawks into a stealth flying machine. Three separate configurations were proposed for the study, each with varying degrees of modification to the baseline UH-60. The designs would be evaluated on weight, performance, radar cross section, cost, safety, risk, and maintainability. Two variants of each configuration were studied. One using conventional building materials and the other using advanced composite materials. The stealthy designs themselves came straight from the Army’s Applied Technology Laboratory. For the limited purposes of the study, the tail rotor would be left in stock configuration. The study reads: Three low radar cross section fuselage configurations for this study were developed by the Applied Technology Laboratory. The first configuration slightly modified the nose section from the baseline configuration; the second configuration changed the fuselage shape along the lines of a truncated triangular prism; the third extended canted flat side shaping throughout the fuselage. The tail surfaces and main rotor pylon fairing were the same as those of the baseline UH-60A. It continues to describe each configuration in greater detail and provides drawings of each fairly wicked looking designs: CONFIGURATION 1 The general arrangement of Configuration 1, shown in Figure 3, was developed from mold line drawing No. 20074180. This configuration alters the baseline fuselage forward of the mid-cabin section (the cockpit). Although this configuration is different from the baseline, the internal structure must be compatible with the forward cabin to avoid a heavy joining structure… The overall length is slightly increased due to this configuration. US Army CONFIGURATION 2 The general arrangement of Configuration 2, shown in Figure 4, was developed from mold line drawing No. 20074135. This configuration is basically a trapezoidal cross-section airframe having sides canted inward 30 degrees and made up of flat exterior structural panels. This configuration is wider at the bottom of the fuselage and narrower at the top of the fuselage than the baseline. This configuration is slightly longer than the baseline UH-60A, and its overall height is slightly larger than the baseline. The increased length, width, and height of Configuration 2 does not allow an aircraft of this size to meet the air transportability requirements of the baseline. The narrow upper fuselage causes the pilot and copilot seats to be spaced closer to each other, and shoulder room in the main cabin is decreased. The main cabin floor is approximately 6 inches higher than the baseline from the ground. The increased floor-to-ground height causes difficulties for combat troops to enter or leave the aircraft quickly. Minor modifications of the mold lines for the transition and tail-cone sections were made to properly house the tail rotor shaft of the baseline UH-60A. US Army US Army CONFIGURATION 3 The general arrangement of Configuration 3, shown in Figure 5, was developed from mold line drawing No. 20074136. This configuration is basically a flat side cross-section airframe having sides canted inward 50 degrees and is tapered in width from a narrow cockpit section to a transition section as wide as the baseline UH-60A. The tail-cone is a rectangular section which is narrower than the baseline. The narrow cockpit causes the pilot and copilot seats to be spaced closer to each other; space for four-across seating in the main cabin is decreased. The cockpit and main cabin floors are at the same height from the ground as the baseline. The slope of the windshields may cause problems of visibility for the flight crew. Minor modifications of the mold lines for the transition and tail-cone sections were made to properly house the tail rotor shaft of the baseline UH-60A. US Army US Army Three wireframe mold line models were also included in the report, one for each of the concepts: US Army US Army US Army The document continues to go into evaluating production concepts of the configurations using traditional aircraft building materials as one option and advanced composites as another. It describes how cost and risk would be impacted by either construction concept, as well as performance and what developmental pitfalls could potentially impact either choice. It’s interesting that while there were concerns over some safety and durability aspects of the composite materials construction concept, the authors noted that using graphite panels and other non-traditional materials would probably be needed to meet low-observable (stealth) goals. US Army An even more telling section is the one on how each design would impact performance compared to a stock UH-60A. In fact, there seems to be a bit of foreshadowing of the crash that occurred 33 years later inside Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan: CONCLUSIONS Comparison of the UH-60A attributes with the calculated results for the three proposed low radar cross section configurations indicate that: 1. A change in the UH-60A configuration to reflect the LRCS1 configuration caused a decrease in the drag of the UH-60A at α=00′. This decrease was reflected through a range of angles of attack (+8′ < α < -8′) with the exception of angles of attack of +8 and -8 respectively, where no change in drag was exhibited. Configuration changes reflecting the LRCS2 and LRCS3 configuration showed increases of 11% and 17% respectively, of the UH-60A drag at α=00′ and as high as 21% and 29%, respectively, at angles of attack of +8′ and -8′. These changes do not reflect the required increase in stabilator size which would result in an additional drag penalty. 2. The LRCS1 configuration produces an insignificant change in lift compared to the UH-60A while the LRCS2 and LRCS3 configurations reflect an additional download of 40% of the UH-60A download at α=40. 3. Compared to the UH-60A, the LRCS2 and LRCS3 configurations demonstrate a substantial reduction in static stability which will require a redesign of the horizontal stabilator. This is primarily due to a reduction in tail effectiveness and an increase in fuselage instability. The reduction in tail effectiveness was estimated at 21% for the LRCS2 concept and 28% for the LRCS3 configuration. Minor changes in the pitching moment of the LRCS1 and LRCS3 configurations, compared to the UH-60A were calculated, however, the LRCS2 trend demonstrated an increase in slope resulting in an 83% increase in basic fuselage instability. 4. The three proposed LRCS configurations demonstrated an increase in vertical drag of 27% for the LRCS1, 106% for the LRCS2, and 70% for the LRCS3, of the basic UH-60A vertical drag. This increase in vertical drag is a direct result of the additional cross-sectional area and sharp edges presented to the downwash of the main rotor by the LRCS2 configuration. In the case of the LRCS3 configuration, the wedge type of cross-sectional area of the cockpit, the additional area of the main landing gear support structure and the presence of sharp edges presented to the main rotor downwash resulted in an increase in vertical drag as indicated. Finally, the increase in vertical drag for the LFCS1 configuration is a direct result of the wedge type cross-sectional area of the cockpit. 5. In comparison to the UH-60A, no change in the maximum cruise speed and endurance of the LRCSl configuration was observed, however, a loss of 217 feet in hover ceiling and 12 feet in OEI service ceiling was exhibited. The performance of the LCS2 and LRCS3 configurations did not meet the performance requirements of the basic UH-60A. Decreases of 7 and 11 knots in maximum cruise speed, 805 and 520 feet in hover ceiling, 248 and 740 feet in OEI service ceiling, and 0.14 and 0.19 hour in endurance were calculated for the LRCS2 aid LRCS3 configurations respectively. Clearly, the more elaborate the stealthy modifications to the baseline H-60 design, the more penalty was paid in drag, overall performance, and especially general instability. This largely vibes with many of the claims about the two helicopters used in the Bin Laden raid over three decades later. These included major performance deficiencies, handling quirks, and were considered by some as downright unstable. Relentless Strike talks about this in detail, stating: “The additional material that made the helicopters invisible to radar also added weight and made them difficult to fly. This gave Team 6’s most experienced men pause. Rehearsals had revealed that the “helicopter was very unstable when they tried to hover,” said a Team 6 operator. “Those things had been mothballed. The [pilots] hadn’t flown them in a while, but they got back out there. … “The helicopters were really forced on us,” a Team 6 source said. “These newfangled helicopters that had never been used before.” During initial planning meetings, McRaven had told Red Squadron to “look at all options” as they considered how to conduct the mission… In Team 6, there were different opinions about whom to blame for the insistence on using the helicopters. Some operators thought the CIA was driving the decision. Others attributed it to McRaven. “He wanted to use these newfangled helicopters,” said an operator. “He sold it to the president that way: These things are invisible to radar, they’ll get in, the [Pakistanis] will never know we were there.” When the helicopters proved unstable during training, the JSOC commander refused to revisit the decision, the operator said.” It remains unclear if a non-stealthy MH-47G or MH-60M special operations helicopter would have experienced the same unrecoverable issue that the Stealth Hawk did that night over Abbottabad, but other factors beyond the helicopter’s known deficiencies came into play in that crash. Namely a far warmer than expected night in the already lofty targeting area and the fact that Stealth Hawks had trained on a model of Bin Laden’s compound in the Nellis Test and Training Range that used wire fencing for the compound’s solid walls. MH-47s belonging to the 160th SOAR take off from an LZ during a demonstration of their capabilities. , US Army Air circulated freely through the wire fencing, but stagnated inside the real McCoy, resulting in the Stealth Hawk experiencing a condition called vortex ring state (some have attributed it to settling with power, and really, it could have been a combination of both), which led to its crash. It’s also worth noting that the 1978 study’s conclusions are based on a modified Black Hawk that still retains its stock four-bladed, unshrouded, tail assembly configuration. We know that the Stealth Hawk that went down Abbottabad had a very elaborate tail modification featuring a cover over its hub and five composite blades. This would have significantly reduced the helicopter’s radar and audible signature, but could have also further impacted its performance in a negative manner. The Stealth Hawks also had a larger, rounded horizontal tailplane that is thicker in chord than the one found on its more traditional brethren. It also appeared to be forward-swept for radar signature reduction. The 1978 study mentions that a larger tailplane would have been necessary in order to keep the more elaborate configurations stable in flight, so seeing this unique feature of the Stealth Hawks used in the Bin Laden raid is yet another indication that the study was incredibly accurate for its age. Public Domain The report also doesn’t take into account other major acoustic reductions that we know would have been a major factor in a stealth Black Hawk design intended for the special operations mission set. Before there were major initiatives to examine reducing the radar signature on helicopters, there were ones to drastically muffle their sound output that made it into an operational form . Naylor details the importance of reduced acoustic signature for a stealthy assault helicopter in Relentless Strike : “The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and the combat development organizations that support it had been experimenting with stealth technologies for many years, beginning with a program to create a stealthy Little Bird . The program progressed to include the Black Hawk, the 160th’s principal assault aircraft. The work had two overall aims: to reduce a helicopter’s radar signature by giving it a different shape and coating it in special materials, and making the aircraft quieter, which usually involved development of a Fenestron, or shrouded tail rotor. (Much of a helicopter’s noise signature comes from its tail rotor.) The 160th took the issue of reducing aircraft noise very seriously. In training exercises the unit would time how far from the target—in time of flight—the rotor sounds could be heard. As a rule, the larger the airframe, the farther out the target could hear the helicopter. The 160th wanted to reduce the time between an enemy hearing a helicopter approaching and it arriving overhead by as much as possible. “Even [cutting] fifteen seconds is huge,” said a 160th veteran. “And thirty seconds is amazing, because then you can be on top of the target and fast-roping people down.” Sound suppression measures would also have added weight and potentially aerodynamic inefficiency to the Stealth Hawks and thus reduced performance, further exacerbating their negative stability and general performance issues. The Stealth Hawks retained the four-bladed rotor hub system found on all Black Hawks, so it’s clear that the sound suppression was approached in a balanced manner against complexity and cost. Public Domain Beyond similarities between the projected deficiencies of a stealthy Black Hawk detailed in the 41-year old report and those of the real ones, the existence of this study gives us new context as to the timeline of the still highly classified program. Once again, Relentless Strike describes the Steal Hawk’s supposed genesis in a very similar fashion as to what I had heard and posited for years. Naylor states: “The stealth Black Hawk gained almost mythical status, like a unicorn. “I remember first hearing about it … in 2000 to 2001,” said a Delta source. The program quickly gained traction. “I remember in 2004 hearing that it was a line item in the budget,” he said. Knowledge of the special access program was on a strictly need-to-know basis, and hardly anyone needed to know. Shortly thereafter the 160th regimental leadership came looking to 1st Battalion—the core unit of Task Force Brown—for two crews to go down to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and start training on the new helicopters. In the end, one crew went after a couple of pilots volunteered. “I never saw them again,” said a 160th source. “They’d be permanently assigned out there.” The program became more formalized. The aircraft were based at Nellis [actually Area 51], but 160th crews trained on them at some of the military’s other vast landholdings in the Southwest: Area 51; China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station in California; and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. U.S. Special Operations Command planned to create a fleet of four and make them the centerpiece of a new covered aviation unit in Nevada. By 2011 Special Operations Command had canceled that plan, but the first two stealth helicopters still existed and certain 1st Battalion crews would rotate down to Nellis to train on them.” Public Domain As I had stated in the past, the events of 9/11 and the larger defense budgets that followed, which included large increases in spending on special operations, combined with the rising threat from rogue states with nuclear programs, accelerated the Stealth Hawk program, or at the very least, breathed new life into it if it had been underway in the 1990s. The RAH-66 Comanche stealth armed-scout helicopter program, an enterprise that sucked down billions in development dollars and was canceled in 2004, also provided Sikorsky with a very deep bag of already-paid-for tricks and solutions to directly incorporate onto a stealthy Black Hawk derivative. Taking the easiest to adapt tech from the RAH-66 and integrating it around the UH-60 would have resulted in a far lower-risk, faster, and more affordable program than starting having never built a stealthy helicopter before. Regardless of the operational requirements, it’s also clear why the Army would have seen such a program as a decent consolation prize for the defunct RAH-66. In the darkness of the classified world, it would keep the stealth helicopter ingenuity and brain trust alive, while also allowing the Army to benefit from billions ‘wasted’ on Comanche without it being a political pawn for those on Capitol Hill or the bean counters in the Pentagon. RAH-66 prototype., Sikorsky I had long posited that the Stealth Hawks were not the result of a ‘snap-on kit’ as it was widely described, but a full buildout around the UH-60’s core drivetrain and subsystems, an idea further backed up again by the 1978 stealth Black Hawk study. Such a design would have also benefitted from Sikorsky’s S-75 technology demonstrator that long predated Comanche. The S-75 first flew in the mid-1980s and acted as a proof of concept for composite helicopter airframe construction utilizing many of the techniques described in the 1978 stealth Black Hawk study. With lessons learned from the S-75, Sikorsky was ready to work at building an operational stealth helicopter, whether it be a RAH-66 or a stealthy Black Hawk derivative. Clearly, only one option survived into the mid-2000s. S-75 technology demonstrator, Sikorsky Being able to better access defended territories for special operations missions wasn’t just about the Global War On Terror, it was also about having the ability to neuter or at least drastically decrease the possibility that a less-than-stable state would get its nuclear arms pilfered by a non-state actor hostile to the United States. Pakistan’s growing nuclear arsenal, in particular, proved to be a unique problem, but by 2009, it was one that defense officials said they could deal with directly in an emergency. This was largely thought to include sending special operations teams in to secure nuclear warheads and material during a crisis, and even removing them. Many found cryptic statements by Pentagon leaders alluding to the U.S. having the ability to do this as indicative of a secret penetrating platform, or platforms , that would be survivable enough to make such a round trip feasible. Just like the stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel drone that was devised to clandestinely spy on nuclear activities of friendly and enemy nations alike, a very low signature assault helicopter would allow special operations to quickly access targets in similar operating environments. And like the RQ-170 that was also developed in the mid-2000s and had a mission that sprung from a secretive stealth program decades earlier, we now know that the Stealth Hawks’ lineage can be traced back to the dawn of stealth technology. Back in 1978, stealth was still in its infancy, although elaborate studies on advanced low-signature aircraft date back many years earlier . Just a year before the stealthy Black Hawk study was delivered, the Skunk Works’ Have Blue demonstrator , a plane that would give birth to the F-117 Nighthawk , first flew. Just four years before that, the idea of a stealth attack aircraft was just taking shape under the highly-classified XST program . So it really is amazing to think that the level of research into a stealth Black Hawk derivative was being done 41 years ago, and a year before the UH-60A Black Hawk even entered into operational service. In the three decades between this 1978 study and the latter half of the 2000s—the latest that the prototype Stealth Hawks would have been delivered—beyond the S-75 and the RAH-66, there is something of a research and development gap. It is possible that the Stealth Hawk concept was born into a prototype state long before 9/11 and the aircraft were remodeled or a second set of prototypes were introduced in the mid to late 2000s as a result of the new geopolitical realities of the decade. Regardless, these aircraft were still experimental and for whatever reason, never made it into production, by the time they were brought out of storage for Operation Neptune Spear. The aircraft’s instability and restricted performance could have been a driving factor in keeping the program in a technology demonstrating and testing stage. Yet according to multiple accounts, the Stealth Hawk concept was totally reborn again in the months and years after the successful mission into Pakistan. Naylor writes: “In the early hours of July 3, 2014, two Black Hawks full of Delta operators crossed the border from Jordan into Syria, flying fast across the desert. Their destination was a compound outside the town of Raqqa, on the north bank of the Euphrates in north-central Syria. It was there, U.S. intelligence analysts believed, that a group calling itself the Islamic State—one of the two Islamist factions waging war in Syria—was holding several Western hostages, including at least two Americans: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The intelligence came from several sources: FBI interviews with two European men that the Islamic State had held as hostages before releasing them, probably as a result of ransoms paid; satellite imagery of a building near Raqqa that matched the descriptions given by the Europeans; and information supplied by Israel. This was not JSOC’s first raid into Syria. But unlike the October 2008 mission to kill Abu Ghadiya, which involved a few minutes’ flight across the Iraqi border, this operation involved penetrating 200 miles into Syrian airspace. For that reason, JSOC had chosen to use the latest version of the stealth Black Hawks that flew the Bin Laden raid. That mission famously left one of the two such aircraft then in existence burned to a crisp in bin Laden’s backyard. But since May 2011 more of the airframes had been constructed, and the program had expanded so that the 160th now kept a unit of about forty personnel under a lieutenant colonel at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, where the stealth helicopters were housed. As the use of the specialized airframes suggested, JSOC had spared little expense to prepare for the operation. The task force had been training for weeks on a replica of the compound they were going to assault. There had been “eyes on the target” for at least a week prior to D-day, reporting what they saw in short, encrypted messages. When the helicopters neared the compound, they were filmed by at least one armed drone overhead.” An MH-60M prepares for a night mission. They don’t call them the Night Stalkers for nothing!, DoD There have also been claims that the stealth Black Hawk was in its second generation when the Bin Laden raid took place, with the older generation being used for the raid out of fear that losing one would compromise far too many technological secrets. The more advanced models are supposedly called Ghost Hawks or ‘Jedi Rides’ and they possess many improvements over their predecessors and are extremely low-observable by design. There is probably some truth to these claims, but it is more likely that the new generation became available after the Bin Laden raid and not before. We have received multiple tips over the years indicating that a new Stealth Hawk program is indeed alive and well and has been used on real-world operations as Naylor describes. With Lockheed having purchased Sikorsky in 2015 , one can only imagine the boost in low-observable knowledge base and technology Sikorsky now has at its fingertips. For all we know we could be on a third or fourth generation Stealth Hawk by now. In fact, I would put money on it. Their likely home? Tonopah Test Range Airport. The prop helicopters used in the film Zero Dark Thiry caused a lot of online buzz and look similar to the concepts outlined in the 1978 report: Such an aircraft would be an ideal complement to a stealthy fixed-wing special operations transport , especially in this day and age of the proliferation of ever more capable integrated air defense systems and anti-access/area-denial strategies. There is also the combat search and rescue issue to consider. As the U.S. moves to a tactical aircraft fleet dominated by stealth technology, how can traditional combat search and rescue assets go to rescue downed aircrews in places where the best stealth fighters couldn’t even survive? This alone seems to be justification for a small but potent low observable special operations helicopter fleet. Regardless of what’s to come for America’s shadowy stealth helicopter capability, it’s amazing to think that it all began 41 years ago with this study. Clearly, they were on to something then, so we can only imagine what the Pentagon has its most elite special operations helicopter crews flying now. As for when we might actually see the remaining Stealth Hawk from the historic raid? It’s anyone’s guess, but I think your best bet would be once the Obama Presidential Library in Chicago opens its doors or the CIA makes another big addition to their museum that you aren’t allowed to visit.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the dead of night, a stealthy U.S. military transport plane discreetly weaves its way past dense enemy air defenses to get to a small landing zone deep inside a country in the throes of a coup by a faction violently opposed to the United States. As they get closer to their objective, the crew switches the plane into a vertical takeoff and landing mode, setting it down in a confined area without the need for any sort of traditional runway. Special operators, which the plane had inserted the same way 24 hours earlier, quickly race onboard. They’ve just rescued diplomats and a handful of other American citizens, some of who are in need of desperate medical attention, who had found themselves trapped inside the country’s capital. After a very short takeoff roll, the transport aircraft leaps into the air before entering into horizontal flight mode. It then disappears back into the night sky as it makes another 1,000-mile trip through the same air defense gauntlet it had overcome just minutes earlier. This may sound like the climactic finale from a Hollywood blockbuster involving a plane that could have been ripped straight out of a Marvel comic book , but the U.S. military has spent very real time and resources on developing stealthy transport aircraft with short- and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities over the past four decades. In exploring this topic in depth, we here at The War Zone have identified more than a dozen named programs since 1980, as well as numerous additional design studies that private firms have carried out in the intervening years – and these are just the ones that we were able to uncover. When paired with major historical events and technological developments over the last four decades, a fascinating story materializes that leaves open a very real possibility, if not an outright probability, that one or more of these programs produced flying aircraft and that those machines remain highly classified to this very day. What follows is the first installment in a two-part investigation into how the requirements for a stealth transport came to be, what configurations were developed to satisfy them, and where are these seemingly missing aircraft that the Pentagon has sought for so many years. A need slowly emerges “For all its shortcomings, the helicopter has proven invaluable because of its ability to place an assault force precisely on target, independent of airfields or large unobstructed terrain,” a 1981 report regarding a Low Observable Air Vehicle Engineering Study (LOAVES) from defense contractor LTV, which Reddit user u/aclockworkgreen1 posted online in 2014 , explained. “[The] Vietnam experience with helicopters ( notably the UH-1 ) demonstrated that slow speed and a distinctive acoustic signature made a truly surprise [helicopter-borne] attack impossible.” The desire to be able to discreetly, or even clandestinely, get a significant force deep into an enemy’s territory, past even the densest air defense defenses, and be able to place those individuals and their equipment as close to the objective as possible is hardly new. The limitations of major airborne operations, especially the danger of scattering troops across a broad area and leaving them vulnerable to immediate counterattacks, has been obvious since World War II. US Army soldiers jump out of a UH-1 helicopter into a landing zone during operations in South Vietnam., US Army Helicopters offered a partial solution, but one that required staging areas much closer to the objective, which would potentially be at risk from enemy strikes. During the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, the U.S. military as a whole explored a variety of tactical transport concepts , including tilt-rotors and tilt-wings, which would combine the speed and range of a traditional tactical airlifter with at least some of the benefits of a helicopter. One of the more notable projects was the Tri-Service Assault Transport Program, which ran from 1961 through 1966 and led to the development of the LTV XC-142A tilt-wing aircraft. The aircraft was supposed to be able to carry 32 combat-ready troops or 8,000 pounds of cargo to designations more than 400 miles away. The design proved to be overly complicated and the U.S. military eventually turned over the last of five prototypes to NASA for research purposes. With more novel concepts, such as the XC-142A, failing to produce practical results, the Air Force settled on more conventional designs, most notably the C-130 Hercules, which did have improved short takeoff and landing performance compared to other transport aircraft of the time. With this in mind, in 1968, the service put together a set of requirements that would lead to the Advanced Medium Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) Transport program, or AMST . This program produced competing designs from Boeing and the McDonnell Douglas. Boeing’s YC-14A featured two large jet engines positioned forward, above and behind the cockpit to improve lift, while the McDonnell Douglas’ YC-15A featured double-slotted, externally blown flaps that would work to produce similar performance, albeit with four engines in a more conventional underwing arrangement. In 1979, AMST morphed into the C-X program, which in turn led to the adoption of the C-17 Globemaster III airlifter, an enlarged derivative of the XC-15A. None of these designs were stealthy, though, and they still required an airstrip for terminal operations. Boeing’s unusual-looking YC-14 prototype., USAF The U.S. Intelligence Community also pursued somewhat similar programs with an eye toward rapidly and discreetly inserting and extracting personnel from hostile countries. One of the best-known examples of this was the Central Intelligence Agency’s modification of two small Hughes 500P helicopters. These two diminutive choppers had special features that reduced their acoustic signature and various sensors and other equipment to allow them to operate at night over extended distances. In December 1972, pilots from the CIA’s front company Air America successfully piloted these helicopters, nicknamed “ The Quiet Ones ,” into North Vietnam from neighboring Laos to wiretap North Vietnamese government phone lines. A modified Hughes 500P, nicknamed “The Quiet One,” during US Army testing., San Diego Air and Space Museum Archives A crisis in Iran While the U.S. military might have had an interest in transport planes and helicopters capable of covert and clandestine operations far behind enemy lines for decades beforehand, the Iran Hostage Crisis rammed the need home. After the fall of Iran’s pro-Western monarch Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979, a group of student revolutionaries took 52 Americans hostage in the U.S. embassy in the country’s capital Tehran. In April 1980, then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter authorized a hostage rescue attempt, known as Operation Eagle Claw . A highly complex mission from the start, the plan involved flying three EC-130E Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center ( ABCCC ) and three MC-130E Combat Talon aircraft into Iran together with six RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters. The EC-130s and MC-130s would carry the rescue force, consisting primarily of Delta Force special operators and members of the Army’s elite 75th Ranger Regiment, as well as supplies to a remote staging area in Iran called Desert One. Crews would then refuel the helicopters and the raiding force would move to a secondary site closer to the Tehran, called Desert Two. RH-53Ds on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz ahead of Operation Eagle Claw., USN From there, the Delta Force personnel would use trucks and other vehicles to race into the city and rescue the hostages while the Rangers would seize control of the nearby Iranian Air Force base at Manzariyeh. The RH-53Ds would then fly the hostages from a soccer field next to the embassy compound to that base, where C-141 Starlifter transport planes would fly them safely out of the country. The mission ended early in a literal ball of fire when an RH-53D hit one of the EC-130Es, which was full of fuel, at Desert One. Eight U.S. military personnel died and four more suffered injuries. The U.S. military aborted the mission and abandoned the other five helicopters in the desert, turning the entire event into a highly embarrassing debacle. The Sea Stallions, and helicopters, in general, were widely seen as a particularly weak link in the original plan due to their limited range and speed, which necessitated the multiple staging areas to begin with. When planning for a second mission began, the proposals included ones in which rotary wing larger cargo aircraft would airlift the helicopters much closer to the target area and others that eliminated choppers altogether. Credible Sport To get the hostages out of Tehran without relying on helicopters, the raiding force would need a novel aircraft that could land and take off inside an extremely confined space. With this in mind, the Air Force acquired a pair highly modified C-130H Hercules cargo planes as part of Project Credible Sport . That name was an apparent reference to the soccer field across from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, where the RH-53D helicopters were supposed to land in the first rescue attempt. The special C-130s would use that same space as an impromptu “runway.” This meant that the aircraft had to be able to land and then take off again in the space of just 600 feet. The MC-130Es, then the only available dedicated special operations version of the Hercules, had a typical takeoff run of about 3,500 feet. An MC-130E Combat Talon in 1991., USAF Lockheed built the first prototype – variously referred to as the XC-130, XFC-130, and XSC-130 – in just two months. The most visible change was the addition of 30 rocket motors from RUR-5 Anti-Submarine Rockets (ASROC) and AGM-45 Shrike radar-seeking missiles attached to various positions on the fuselage, wings, and tail. The force from the rockets would serve four distinct purposes: forcing the plane down quickly into a confined space, cushioning that impact, bringing the aircraft to stop, and then blasting it back into the air. The planes also had double-slotted flaps and additional fins above and below the fuselage and wings to help generate extra lift. In testing, the first Credible Sport prototype was able to get airborne within 150 feet. After traveling the maximum 600 feet distance that the soccer field in Tehran would have allowed for, it was able to hit an altitude of 30 feet and reach a speed of more than 130 miles per hour. The aircraft never made it to Iran, though. On Oct. 29, 1980, the first prototype crashed and burned spectacularly during a test flight at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Thankfully no one was hurt. https://youtube.com/watch?v=etzqmtYcpCQ “Attainment of the rocket-assisted capability is a much needed but secondary consideration,” U.S. Army Major General James Vaught, who had led Operation Eagle Claw and was in charge of the follow-on mission planning, wrote in a subsequent memo that the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. “Further testing of the rocket concept could be continued once a necessary complement of 16 operational MC-130’s has been acquired.” Vaught seemed somewhat perturbed that projects like Credible Sport were wasting valuable aerial-refueling capable C-130s, which were in short supply at the time throughout the Air Force. When he wrote his missive, the general had only nine of the 16 Vietnam-era MC-130Es he wanted in total on hand. In November 1980, the issue became increasingly moot. That month , the new Iranian regime put forward its conditions for releasing the hostages, leading to negotiations, with Algeria acting as an intermediary. In January 1981, the immediate crisis ended when the two countries signed the Algiers Accords . The last American hostages had left Iran by the end of the month. Individuals who had previously been held hostage in Iran arrive at Andrews Air Force Base after their release on board VC-137 Stratoliner aircraft dubbed “Freedom One” in 1981., DOD A turning point It’s hard to overstate the significance of Operation Eagle Claw and the Iran Hostage Crisis on the U.S. military. The incident at Desert One shook the American special operations community to its core. It directly led to the creation of the elite U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) as we know it today and impacted every aspect of the of the special operations community, its structure, and its core decision making processes for decades afterward. It drove the establishment of an entire fleet of dedicated special operations fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, among many other types of vehicles and highly specialized gear. At the same time, it created a new impetus for the clandestine development stealthier airlifters with highly impressive short takeoff and landing capabilities or even the ability to take off and land vertically. In addition, the advancing capabilities of enemy air defenses and the increasing proliferation of those systems, especially surface-to-air missile systems, continued to drive a tangential desire for a stealthy tactical transport design that could penetrate deep into enemy airspace undetected. “Sophisticated Warsaw Pact air defense sensors and weapons are steadily filtering down to Soviet client states,” the 1981 LOAVES report noted. “Battlefield mobility must be achieved despite the growing threat to aircraft.” The Credible Sport design was anything but stealthy with its dozens of rocket boosters bolted on externally to an already non-stealthy design. Between 1980 and 1982, the Air Force did pursue a follow-on to this aircraft, known as Credible Sport II , but ultimately abandoned the idea. The service used the prototype, known as the YMC-130H, to support the development of the next special operations-specific C-130, the MC-130H Combat Talon II . The MC-130H offered updated terrain following radar and other navigation systems improvements, enabling it to better conduct low-level nap-of-the-earth operations, even at night. Enhanced communications were also added to increase connectivity and defense aids were updated to help improve situational awareness and survivability. This presented the lowest hanging fruit for the Air Force to readily obtain at least some form of improved aerial infiltration capability from existing aircraft designs. An MC-130H Combat Talon II in 1999. , Mike Freer via Wikimedia The stealth revolution Despite its improvements over previous special operations transport aircraft, the MC-130H Combat Talon II remained a non-stealthy platform, leaving space open for future low-observable designs. When LTV published its LOAVES study, stealth technology was well on its way to transitioning from a general concept to an operational reality, though these developments remained highly classified . Lockheed’s F-117 Nighthawk was well on its way to becoming the first operational stealth combat aircraft and Northrop’s revolutionary Tacit Blue steath demonstrator was just about to make its first flight. Accompanying illustrations in LTV’s report, shows a notional stealthy aircraft, called the Low Observable Air Vehicle-11 (LOAV-11), with a modified delta wing planform. There are seats for twelve passengers, six on either side of the engine. A proposed design for a stealthy, vertical takeoff and landing capable assault transport aircraft known as the Low Observable Air Vehicle-11 (LOAV-11)., LTV via u/aclockworkgreen1 During conventional, level flight, the aircraft’s main jet engine would take in air from a dorsal-mounted forward intake, though the engine itself was recessed deep inside the fuselage . The turbofan’s placement, combined with the top-mounted intake, would have dramatically reduced the plane’s radar signature by burying the engine face deep within the fuselage. Northrop used this type of configuration, which is notoriously complicated , in its Tacit Blue design and it has more recently appeared on Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray unmanned tanker aircraft. In the LOAVES design, during vertical flight, an internal door would divert thrust from the main engine downward. At the same time, a second door would prevent air from the main intake from passing through to the main engine. Instead, an auxiliary inlet would open up behind the main intake, providing air to the main engine while in vertical flight mode. A driveshaft from the turbojet would then power a lift fan to provide vertical lift at the front of the aircraft. We don’t know what became of the LOAVES concept, though the underlying requirements clearly informed later projects. The fates of many of those subsequent programs similarly remain a mystery. A drawing showing the engine arrangement in the LOAV-11., LTV via u/aclockworkgreen1 AT3 and SOFA In the mid-1980s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, one of the Pentagon’s top research and development arms, did hire plane maker Scaled Composites and its enigmatic founder and chief designer Burt Rutan, to craft a proof-of-concept transport aircraft design focused again primarily on extended range and short takeoff and landing capabilities. This project was known as the Advanced Technology Tactical Transport, abbreviated ATTT or AT3. “Airlift for Special Operations Forces (SOF) has received a great deal of attention since the early 1980s,” defense contractor SRS technologies wrote in a subsequent report on behalf of DARPA regarding the project. “Possibly the most difficult SOF mission is long-range infiltration and exfiltration of small forces deep behind enemy lines.” DARPA envisioned an aircraft that would’ve been able to carry 8,500 pounds of passengers or cargo on an unrefueled round-trip spanning more than 2,400 miles. The notional high-low flight profile would involve taking off from an airfield at 5,000 feet above sea level and cruising at 1,000 feet above ground level at speeds between around 260 and 290 miles per hour. The aircraft would then be able to land on an unprepared airstrip 1,000 feet above sea level more than 1,200 nautical miles away before loading or unloading personnel and cargo and then returning to base. The proposed ATTT mission profile., DARPA The resulting Scaled Composites Model 133 design, also known as the Special Mission Utility Transport (SMUT), was a twin-engine turboprop with an unusual dual wing-and-flap arrangement to provide additional lift. This was reportedly a two-thirds scale testbed for a possible full-size example. The original configuration featured a traditional tail, but handling problems led to a revision of the design to feature a twin-boom tail similar in basic layout to that of the Rockwell OV-10 Bronco light attack and observation aircraft. The AT3 effort seems to have either flowed into or run parallel to a related project known simply as the Special Operations Forces Aircraft (SOFA). A 1987 memo from the Advanced Development Projects Office within the Air Force’s Aerospace Sustainment Directorate, then part of Air Force Materiel Command, described this notional platform as having “Stealth Features – High survivability,” a combat radius of around 550 miles, the ability to carry 12 to 20 combat-ready troops, and conduct short take off and landings from unimproved services. The revised Model 133 design with the twin-boom tail configuration., Scaled Composites Reddit user u/aclockworkgreen1 also posted this document online in 2014. The memo appears to describe a stealthy aircraft that would have similar capabilities to the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, which was also in development at the time. There was also talk of a requirement for 50 such aircraft to enter initial operational service sometime in the mid-to-late 1990s. Lockheed is rumored to have won the contract to create a concept for the SOFA, which would make sense given its experience with the Credible Sport and Credible Sport II programs, which were then in very recent memory. The company’s Skunk Works advanced design bureau was also at the very forefront of stealth aircraft technology with the work on the F-117 firmly under its belt. Based on publicly available concept art , the proposed design was radically different from a modified C-130. It had a flying wing planform with low-observable characteristics and was, in broad strokes, a lift fan arrangement that was very reminiscent of the one Ryan Aeronautical had used in their Vertifan jump jet prototypes and proposals. Traditional jet engines would provide forward thrust, while two lift fans, one in each wing, would give the aircraft short to vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. In Ryan’s designs, however, the lift fans were unpowered themselves. When the pilot of a Vertifan shifted to vertical takeoff and landing mode, doors in the wings opened and a valve shifted exhaust from the main turbojet engines to drive the fans and provide lift. It is unclear from the concept art whether Lockheed ever used a similar configuration. Lockheed’s Special Operations Forces Transport (SOFA) concept., Lockheed via Ebay In 1994, the company received a patent for a fan-in-wing propulsion system distinct from the one Ryan had used in the past, involving a set of mechanical linkages between two sets of three turboshaft jet engines and the pair of lift fans, all tucked inside a notional flying wing design. The driveshaft concept is similar at its most basic level to the arrangement that LTV described for their LOAVES aircraft. The turbofan jet engine in Lockheed Martin’s vertical takeoff and landing capable F-35B Joint Strike Fighter is also connected to the central lift fan via a drive shaft. The SOFA design would have had much larger diameter fans, though. Above and immediately below are figures from the patent Lockheed won in 1994., USTPO USTPO USTPO USTPO The planform of the notional aircraft that the patent documentation shows is very similar to descriptions of unconfirmed “ black triangle ” or “home plate” aircraft that individuals claim to have spotted on numerous occasions in the late 1980s and 1990s. Among the best-known examples is a wave of sightings in Belgium between 1989 and 1990. In on instance, Belgian F-16 fighter jets scrambled to try to intercept an unknown radar contact, but did not find anything. An individual, known only as Patrick M., has since claimed that a purported picture of one of the aircraft was a hoax image he created, prompting additional skepticism about the sightings, in general. Given the length of time necessary to file a patent and receive an award, it is very possible that this was the engine setup that Lockheed had been expecting to use in its 1980s SOFA project. Lockheed Martin, the result of a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta, publicly revived this fan-in-wing arrangement in 2010 , when it unveiled a model of an unmanned aircraft with a similar flying wing design. This subsequently became known as the Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Advanced Reconnaissance Insertion Organic Unmanned System, or VARIOUS . Senior Citizen While AT3 and SOFA were ongoing, another far more secretive project, known as Senior Citizen , was also reportedly in progress. It is possible that the other two programs may have even served as something of a cover for elements of this Special Access Program . It is also worth noting up front that neither the U.S. Air Force nor DARPA, both of which are understood to have been involved in the project, have ever officially disclosed that Senior Citizen’s work was in relation to a stealthy, vertical or short-takeoff and landing transport aircraft design. At present, no formal confirmation exists in publicly available documents, either. “This is a special access program,” is one of only two sentences a 2004 Department of Defense manual that defines budget line item codes has in its description of Senior Citizen. “Access will be granted on a strict need-to-know basis only.” An official description of Senior Citizen, categorized as a “Mobility Forces” program, tucked in between program codes for a convention short takeoff and landing capable transport aircraft and C-130 modernization efforts., DOD That being said, the Air Force “owns” the so-called “first-word” “Senior” for code names and it has a long history associated with advanced and secretive aircraft projects, including the Advanced Technology Bomber , which evolved into the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . Northrop’s winning proposal was originally nicknamed Senior Ice, with its competitor from Lockheed known as Senior Peg. After the Air Force picked the B-2 design, it initially referred to it as Senior Cejay or Senior C.J. There’s also the “Senior Trend” F-117A , “Senior Crown” SR-71 , “Senior Guardian” Grob D 450/500 , “Senior Band” RG-8A , and many more . There is some public evidence to point to the purported winning design, including concept art of a “Vertical Lift B-2 Concept” from Northrop that appeared in Flight International magazine. “I do not think I can discuss Senior Citizen in any way,” Scaled Composites’ Burt Rutan is reported to have said when asked about the program, further suggesting that it was a real advanced aircraft project. The exact dates and outcome of the program are still very much unconfirmed. Based on information various individuals have collected, in 1983, DARPA and the Air Force may have hired both Northrop and Boeing to create stealthy, vertical takeoff and landing capable transport aircraft concepts as part of Senior Citizen. This would have come right after the Air Force’s decision to end the Credible Sport II program, the height of the ATB project, and the beginning of the F-117A’s operations. A low-quality scan of the concept art that appeared in Flight International showing a “Vertical Lift B-2 Concept.”, Northrop via Flight International via Stargazer A flying prototype? As Senior Citizen progressed, DARPA and the Air Force reportedly picked Northrop’s design, which, if it was related to the artwork that appeared in Flight International , had a rhombus-shaped flying wing-like planform. The engine arrangement was similar to that of the B-2 together with four lift fans, two in each wing. Other reports describe it as a more triangular shaped flying wing, similar in general terms to the McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics A-12 Avenger II stealth attack plane design. Senior Citizen may have even pursued two different designs after downselecting from multiple concepts. It is also entirely possible that Northrop’s public concept art was unrelated to any particular project. The “Vertical Lift B-2 Concept” could also have been a way of actively distracting attention from the program’s actual work. Concept art of the McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics A-12 Avenger II stealth attack aircraft., USN There have been suggestions that Northrop’s design also featured piping to send either compressed air or bleed air from the engines out through various points on the leading and trailing edges of the aircraft, which could have given it the ability to move side to side and even backward in vertical flight mode. Blown air over the wing could have improved its short takeoff and landing capabilities thanks to the Coandă effect or helped it maneuver in horizontal flight. Purportedly, at least one type of aircraft to come out of Senior Citizen completed flight testing in 1988 and reached initial operational capability in 1989. Some individuals claim that the Air Force employed one of these aircraft to insert special operations personnel in advance of the U.S.-led liberation of Kuwait and intervention into Iraq during Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991. There were a number of reported sightings of the Senior Citizen around the United States, as well as at various RAF bases in the United Kingdom, though evidence to support any of these claims is scant. These could easily be reports about seeing B-2s or other known stealth aircraft flying their developmental and operational test and evaluation phases, as well. A B-2 bomber., USAF Still, the latter reports may help explain a mysterious incident that occurred at RAF Boscombe Down in 1994, which reportedly centered on a mishap involving a top-secret stealth aircraft. However, that incident has links to the Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has also suggested the aircraft in question there could have been an intelligence-gathering platform. “We believe your request as written would more likely fall under the auspices of the U.S. Air Force and Department of Defense,” Allison Fong, Information and Privacy Coordinator at the CIA, wrote in response to a Freedom of Information Act request we had submitted regarding Boscombe Down. It is noteworthy that the Agency did not refuse to confirm or deny that any such incident had occurred at all. The Air Force Safety Center responded to an identical FOIA request saying that it had no information about a mishap involving one of the service’s aircraft at Boscombe Down in 1994. Air Force Materiel Command has yet to respond to a third request on the matter. A flying Senior Citizen aircraft would not have automatically meant that the plane was operational or in production, either. Whatever the case, the Senior Citizen Special Access Program ceased to be active sometime between 1993 and 1994. After that, any design work or flyable aircraft would have come under the purview of other programs and budget funding streams. A Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jet takes off from what is now known as MoD Boscombe Down in 2016., Rodw via Wikimedia Other work continued Whether or not Senior Citizen led to the introduction of an actual stealth transport or not, it definitely did not stop the Air Force from continuing to pursue related developments. In the early 1990s, while the Special Access Program was still active, yet another project began, known as the Special Operations Forces Transport Aircraft ( SOFTA ). LTV Aircraft Products Group started its design study in May 1991, outsourcing the work to none other than Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites, though the LOAVES study suggests the company had been looking into the design of such an aircraft for at least a decade beforehand. It’s also worth noting that Rutan had worked on the XC-142A project, another LTV product, in the 1960s. LTV also helped in the production of the B-2 bomber. LTV’s requirements, which are similar to those for the LOAVES concept, were relatively limited when it came to load-carrying capacity. The company sought designs that would only be able to carry a 12-man Army Special Forces A Team and 500 pounds of cargo, for a total payload weight of 4,500 pounds. By comparison, a V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, a non-stealthy aircraft with a similar dimensional footprint, can carry twice as many personnel and up to four times that total payload weight internally. As with the aforementioned Advanced Technology Tactical Transport (ATTT) requirements, the SOFTA aircraft would need to have a combat radius of more than 1,000 miles and be able to self-deploy to forward operating sites more than 2,400 miles away, according to LTV reports. The goal was also to have a “low to moderate” radar and acoustic signatures and have both short and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. Rutan quickly provided a dozen design concepts, with LTV eventually selecting six of them – the Models 209, 213, 215, 216, 220, and 223 – for further study in October 1991. Each one was significantly different. The 209 was perhaps the most conventional, being a twin-engine tilt-wing design similar in basic concept to the XC-142A and in some respects to the V-22. The 216 had three tilting engines, one in the nose and two on either side of the rear fuselage, all separate from a central wing. The Scaled Composites Model 209., Scaled Composites/LTV The Scaled Composites 216., Scaled Composites/LTV The 213 was similar in some respects to a compound helicopter, which a multi-bladed main rotor assembly on top of a fuselage with a conventional wing and tail arrangement. In this design, the rotor would stop during forward flight. The Scaled Composites 213., Scaled Composites/LTV The 215 was another one of Rutan’s tandem wing designs, but featured a retractable skirt between the main wing and front canard on either side. When deployed, this would have given the jet-powered plane the appearance of a flying squirrel . “For SuperSTOL operations, the aircraft is slowed to near the stall speed, then is continuously slowed as the skirt is unfurled laterally between the canard and wing,” Rutan explained an October 1991 report to LTV. “The skirt edges are retained in tracks similar to that used on high-performance racing sailboats using a continuous root-to-tip cable loop at the canard and the wing.” Aft- and downward-facing rockets would help the plane land in a very short distance, similar to the Credible Sport C-130. Additional rockets would have helped it take off again. A wireframe diagram showing the Scaled Composites Model 215 with the skirt extended and retracted., Scaled Composites LTV The 220 was a twin-engine turboprop all-wing design, similar in many aspects to the World War II-era Vought V-173 “Flying Pancake” and XF5U “Flying Flapjack.” Unlike those aircraft, Rutan’s plane would have landed vertically on its tail and taken off in the same fashion. Various U.S. military services had experimented with similar designs, such as the Convair XFY , in the 1950s. The Scaled Composites Model 220., Scaled Composites/LTV Perhaps most interesting of the concepts was the 223, which was a low-observable flying wing similar in basic planform to Northrop’s initial Advanced Technology Bomber designs . Instead of landing to insert and extract personnel and cargo, the plane would release a number of parachute-retarded pods. This portion of the concept also had a certain amount in common with capsulized emergency escape systems present on certain Cold War combat aircraft, notably the F-111 Aardvark . At the end of a mission, the plane would return and scoop them back up while still in flight by using a system similar to the Fulton Recovery System , or Skyhook, which you can read about in more detail here . It’s not immediately apparent how the plane would fully reel the pods back inside. With Skyhook, the “captured” individual trails behind the aircraft and personnel in the rear use a separate system to haul them onboard. DARPA’s more recent Gremlins reusable drone program is evaluating a similar aerial recovery mechanism . Scaled Composites 223 depicted deploying a personnel pod, at left, and recovering it, at right., Scaled Composites/LTV It’s not clear what happened to any of these designs or the SOFTA project as a whole. LTV expected to have a final design make its first flight in 1994, but there’s no indication this happened, at least not publicly. It is possible that the program was yet another extension of the work done under Senior Citizen or a further cover for those developments. As with earlier projects, such as Senior Citizen, multiple companies may have taken part in the SOFTA program. LTV may have developed its SOFTA concepts as part of a U.S. military project with a separate name that involved multiple firms, as well. We do know that in the early 1990s, Northrop was also working on developing its own stealthy assault transport design that it referred to as the Special Operations Low-Intensity Combat Mission Aircraft, which was smaller than the B-2-like aircraft reportedly under development as part of Senior Citizen. We at The War Zone were the first to report on the existence of this special operations transport project, which appears to have been closer in general size and scope to LOAVES and SOFTA concepts. A mockup of the cockpit for Northrop’s Special Operations Low-Intensity Combat Mission Aircraft., Northrop Grumman What’s to come in Part II With all this historical context laid out in detail, part two of our expose dives into the really exciting material. Our research paints a clear picture of how these requirements not only never went away, they actually expanded as the new millennium arrived. After the events of 9/11 and the dawn of the Global War On Terror, followed by the emergence of the age of ‘great power competition’ and anti-access/area-denial warfare strategies that we are in today, the need for special operators to be able to rapidly insert deep into highly contested territory has become more pressing than ever. As our investigation draws closer to the present day, we have uncovered detailed information about a number of initiatives that aimed to provide just these type of capabilities. Maybe most importantly, we also discuss the very real possibility that some of these concepts have not only flown, but that they could very well be in an operational state today. If not, the far bigger question is could such a reality even be possible after 40 years, dozens of initiatives, and untold sums of money having been thrown at the problem.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",What U.S. Submariners Actually Say About Detection Of So-Called Unidentified Submerged Objects,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been a spate of high-profile claims regarding U.S. Navy nuclear submarines detecting and even interacting with the underwater equivalent of Unidentified Flying Objects, referred to in UFO circles as USOs, or Unidentified Submerged Objects. Yet when it comes to the covert world of naval warfare below the waves, it is easy for laymen to misinterpret things that may seem very much alien to them, but are actually quite commonplace. The War Zone reached out some of its submariner contacts, all of which have many years of experience aboard U.S. Navy nuclear submarines, to see if detection of unidentified objects actually happens and what their thoughts were on the topic in general. We were surprised by what we heard. Eyewitness reports of USOs are nothing new. Reports of them go back many years and some from credible sources, but being detected by nuclear submarines packed with most sensitive listening equipment on the planet, which today is comprised of sonar arrays and computer systems costing hundreds of millions of dollars, is another story. USN On December 29th, 2018, our friend Danny Silva of the Thesilvarecord.com brought the following to our attention. Tom DeLonge , once the lead man for the rock group Blink 182 turned front man for To The Stars Academy , a flashy new hybrid entertainment-technology-research group that focuses on disclosure of information regarding UFOs, made the Instagram post below. In it he claims, without any evidence, that “a few years ago an unidentified craft was underwater and pinned against the North Atlantic coast by multiple nuclear attack submarines for over a week.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tom DeLonge (@tomdelonge) Then a story that first made its rounds in 2017 hit social media again just last week. The supposed first-hand account of Astronomer and UFO researcher Marc D’Antonio describes a ride aboard a nuclear fast attack submarine in the North Atlantic and the sudden appearance of a very high-performance object on sonar. One version of the account reads: “Marc, who runs a special effects company called FX Models that undertakes Naval contracts, said: “As a thank you for doing some work for them Navy asked me if I wanted to go for a ride in a submarine so I said yes. “Once we got under I was sitting in the sonar station and the sonar operator was sitting right next to me. “Submarines are loud – people think they are very quiet and it’s true they are on the outside because the sound doesn’t get out. But inside you hear fans, noise – it’s a constant din on a sub. “I was sitting there zoning out a little because I was sea sick and all of a sudden the sonar kid shouts ‘fast mover, fast mover’ and I’m jolted awake – thinking ‘What’s happening? Is it a torpedo?’ “The executive officer comes out and the operator shows him the path of the object and the officer says ‘How fast is that going?’ “And the kid said ‘several hundred knots’. I start to lean forward to listen in – and the officer said ‘Can you confirm it?’ “So he goes to another sonar machine and confirmed it wasn’t a machine anomaly – it was real. I thought ‘Wow that is incredible’. “When the sonar guy said ‘What do I do with this?’ the officer said ‘log it and dog it’ – in other words log it and bury it.” Four years later Marc said he was doing some more contract work for the Navy when he spoke to a senior naval figure about what he saw. “I asked him ‘Can you tell me about the Fast Mover Programme?'” Marc explained. “He looked at me and said ‘Sorry Marc I can’t talk about that programme’. “So he basically confirmed to me that the programme exists – he said everything without seeing anything. “What that told me was that USOs are common – we even have a programme in place to classify and log and determine the speed of them and it goes into a vault.” Marc made the claims at the Devil’s Tower UFO Rendezvous in Hulett, Wyoming – where UFO enthusiasts from around America met at the site of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind rock to discuss alien-related findings. We talked with a number of sources during our investigation. What we learned is that yes, unexplained noises and even tracked contacts do pop-up on submarines’ sonars, some of which seem to move at incredible speeds, but it is rare and the data is often inconclusive as to what was actually detected. But maybe most interesting, and peculiarly so, is that the Navy doesn’t actually have a way to classify these strange sounds as unknown and tag them for further review. One of our contacts that was willing to go on the record is veteran sonar operator and instructor turned pro gamer ‘Jive Turkey’ —we did an in-depth (pardon the pun) piece on Jive recently which you can read here . After reviewing D’Antonio’s account, Jive pointed out some issues with it: “The article is full of errors and assumptions. There is not a “Fast Mover” program and we don’t give ‘rides’ as favors.” I asked Jive if strange encounters do occur and how they are handled if so. He told me that they do, although they are rare and there is no way to really classify them as strange: I don’t know what they are…  We usually logged it as seismic or biologic. We were instructed that nothing is ever ‘unknown.’ That’s the thing, it’s so quick you can’t measure the speed. In the examples I am thinking of, it is a detection that lasts a few seconds on the towed array. There is no way to measure the speed accurately because there isn’t enough data… I agree it’s odd. There are a lot of odd things in the ocean. Mainly, submariners! USN Another contact we talked to with extensive experience aboard nuclear submarines noted that the mission is so heavily focused on military objectives that strange sounds picked up by sonar don’t carry the weight that many may think they would unless they seem like some sort of a threat or impediment to the mission or training goals. This source also noted that they were not aware of any way to even log this type of thing for special review. In fact, they noted that the system seems uniquely designed for just the opposite. Eric Moreno—another veteran submariner, @KingNeptune767 on Twitter, and keeper of the popular Subreddit r/submarines —also had some good information to share. Strange acoustic anomalies don’t just pop up on U.S. Navy submarine sonars, but also sonars and hydrophones belonging to scientific institutions. Moreno mentioned the somewhat famous ‘ 52-hertz Whale ‘ and pointed us to this video below as examples: As a torpedoman by training, he also mentioned very high-speed super-cavitating torpedo technology that various militaries around the globe are becoming increasingly interested in. The Soviet Union actually put one of these weapons, the VA-111 Shkval , into service. At max speed, these weapons can hit over 200mph. But just because they exist doesn’t mean they are fired at or near American fast attack submarines, and especially boats that are on training sorties with visitors onboard. Also, they are not some totally mysterious anomaly to seasoned sonar operators. I even asked my sources if the strange contact D’Antonio’s supposedly experienced being detected could have been something above the surface of the water, such as a maritime patrol aircraft. They said the speed would make that more plausible, but it shouldn’t have been any sort of a mystery then. They also added they were aware of very high-speed targets on sonar that were never explained, but they have no idea where that information went, or where it didn’t go for that matter. The biggest takeaway here is that mysterious sounds do emanate from the deep and are heard by the most talented sonar operators in the world working the most advanced underwater listening equipment ever created. But the Navy seems to have made it all but impossible to classify these events for further review as sonar operators aren’t allowed to ‘not know’ what something is. USN As for a quartet of American submarines pinning an impossible to identify craft down in the depths of the Atlantic, we are still waiting to see any evidence of anything like that occurring. It doesn’t do the To The Stars Academy or DeLong any favors teasing such information in such an amateurish way either. This is unfortunate considering the high aims of To The Stars Academy and the impressive brain trust they have amassed. But that’s a whole other story we will save for the not so distant future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 5, 2020",Lamborghini Tried To Break Into The Military Market With Its G.I. Joe Toy Looking “Cheetah”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you hear Lamborghini and the 1970s in the same sentence, you probably think about the origins of the iconic Countach luxury sports car. What you might not know is that, just three years after introducing the Countach, the Italian car maker went in a completely different direction, developing an off-road vehicle called the Cheetah that looks like it could have had a starring role in the cult-classic Death Race 2000 . Able to carry machine guns or TOW anti-tank missiles , the company even tried to pitch it to the U.S. military. Lamborghini publicly unveiled the futuristic-looking Cheetah at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland. Mobility Technology International (MTI), situated in San Jose, California, had developed the vehicle under contract to the Italian firm. The 4×4 vehicle featured a dune buggy-like design with an open center area with a simple roll cage to protect the occupants. It had a rear-mounted Chrysler V8 engine producing 180 brake horsepower attached to a three-speed automatic transmission. The 4,500-pound vehicle could reportedly hit speeds up over 100 miles per hour on paved roads and had seating for the driver and three passengers, one in the front and two in the back. Lamborghini promoted the design’s low profile and independent suspension as being ideal for military use. The vehicle came with low-pressure tires to better navigate sand and other loose terrain. These also had a higher-pressure inner tube that the Cheetah could run on if the outer tire wall burst, offering sort of run-flat capability. The Cheetah., Teledyne Continental Motors via Warwheels.net Though the initial design featured a lightweight fiberglass body, the decision was made to switch to a sheet steel construction for the final prototype. This gave it the ability to drive over various obstacles without risking breaking the fiberglass body.  The engine compartment was waterproofed, too, allowing it to ford water up to three feet deep. Cheetah’s “performance uniquely qualifies it for duty in the combat zone where it can serve in many capacities,” the narrator in a marketing video, seen below, which opens with a musical score reminiscent of many later 1980s action television shows , explains. “As a TOW missile system carrier, a reconnaissance vehicle, a command and control vehicle, a prime mover for light artillery, or on convoy escort duty and security patrols.” If these mission sets seem particularly specific, this is because these were the roles the U.S. Army was looking to fill with a new family of light tactical vehicles at the time. The service was looking to replace the mix of Ford M151 Jeeps and LTV M561 Gama Goats it was then using to perform these tasks. But Army troops were not destined to take Lamborghini trucks into battle. The rear-mounted engine reportedly threw off the vehicle’s balance, giving it poor turning and other handling characteristics, even on improved surfaces. Despite it’s name, the Cheetah was underpowered, as well, without any specialized military equipment added on top of the basic curb weight. Fully loaded with weapons and gear, with four fully-equipped soldiers inside, the performance would have been far worse. To make matter’s worse, MTI’s Cheetah design was at best influenced by, and at worst outright copied, an earlier vehicle known as the XR311 that FMC had developed as a private venture in 1969. Over the next few years, the Army eventually obtained around 10 XR311s in a number of slightly different configurations and evaluated them in a variety of roles, including as scout and patrol vehicles armed with machine guns, automatic grenade launchers, recoilless rifles, TOW missiles, and even the 30mm cannon from the then still-in-development AH-64 Apache gunship helicopter. An experimental XR311 armed with the same 30mm cannon found in the Apache gunship helicopter., US Army As with the Cheetah, the XR311s were low-profile, high-speed vehicles. With their 187-horsepower V8s, they could do 0-60 in 12 seconds and hit top speeds between 80 to 90 miles on the road, according to Fourwheeler Network . By 1978, the Army was still experimenting with the vehicles, but had declined to purchase large numbers, primarily due to concerns about whether the vehicles would be suitably survivable in the scout and anti-tank roles. That year, the service’s Ballistic Research Laboratory produced a study with a number of different concepts for using lightweight and flexible nylon or Kevlar “armor” to shield its crew. A line drawing of a notional XR311 TOW missile carrier with flexible nylon or Kevlar side panels, windscreen, and bonnet over the gunner’s position., US Army The Cheetah was so similar to the XR311, that FMC sued MTI and Lamborghini for infringing on their design. It is unclear what the result of that legal action was, but MTI’s lead designer Rodney Pharis did manage to demonstrate his vehicle for the Army. The Army passed on Cheetah, just as it had with the XR311. Lambroghini, already reeling from a string of financial difficulties beginning in the early 1970s, and unable to find any other military buyers, abandoned the entire project. The company subsequently sold the rights and lone prototype to Teledyne Continental Motors. Teledyne Continental Motors had no better luck with the Cheetah. In 1979, the Army put out its final requirements for new light tactical vehicles as part of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) program. Two years later, it awarded AM General the contract to build hundreds of what would become widely known as “Humvees” or “Hummers.” The most recent iterations of this iconic design remain in service with the U.S. military and in dozens of countries around the world. Lamborghini’s 4×4 ambitions didn’t die with the Cheetah project, though. At the 1981 Geneva Auto Show, the company, reinvigorated by a burst of outside investment, revealed the LM001 , which it had derived from the earlier design. The LM stood for Lamborghini Militaria and reflected the company’s continuing desire to produce a light tactical military vehicle. The Lambroghini LM001., Lamborghini Swapping the Chrsyler engine for an AMC V8, the LM001 reportedly had many of the same performance and handling problems as the Cheetah. Lamborghini had planned to use its own proprietary V12 , found on the Countach, in subsequent models to provide extra power, but discontinued the entire project after building the first prototype. In 1982, Lamborghini abandoned the rear-mounted engine configuration and various other features from the Cheetah completely, further evolving the LM001 into a much more conventional 4×4 truck with a front-mounted engine. This vehicle, the LMA001, eventually transformed into the LM002, which did enter limited production. An LM002., Detectandpreserve via Wikimedia The LM002 featured the company’s iconic V12 engine, which provided more than ample power for the truck, but retailed for around $120,000. The vehicle eventually gained the nickname “ Rambo Lambo ,” but still failed to find any military buyers. Lamborghini offered civilian versions with luxurious interiors, including full leather trim and then-state-of-the-art stereo systems. Italian race car and rally car driver Sandro Munari also drove modified versions in a number of off-road races. In a bizarre twist of fate, in 2004, American troops in Iraq blew up an LM002 that had once belonged to Uday Hussein , son of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein , as part of an experiment to determine the effects of a car bomb on concrete blast walls. This seems to be the extent of the U.S. military’s use of any of Lamborghini’s LM-series vehicles. Uday’s LM002 before getting blown up in 2004., via Motorpasión via Motorpasión Sticks of explosives in the back of the LM002., via Motorpasión The remnants of the Rambo Lambo after the detonation., via Motorpasión Between 1987 and 1993, Lamborghini made two more truck prototypes based on the LM002, the LM003 and LM004 , but neither entered production. With less than 330 LM002s ever made, they’re highly sought after by collectors and command prices to match their rarity, often around $400,000 at least . Guzzling gas at between 8 and 12 miles per gallon on the highway, and only having tanks able to hold between 45 to 70 gallons in total, its an expensive vehicle to drive at all. A single one of the original run-flat tires will set you back around $5,000 . The company has made a number of attempts to get into the SUV market since then. These projects finally bore fruit in February 2018, when the Urus entered production. This vehicle, which has a sticker price starting at around $200,000, has proven to be a relatively big seller for Lamborghini already. But the Urus, with a design more reminiscent of an oversized luxury sedan, has, at best, a spiritual connection to the Cheetah and subsequent LM-series vehicles. Of course, that hasn’t stopped the Urus from going on display next to an LM002 in the Lamborghini museum in Italy. But the company seems to have put the idea of the Lamborghini Militaria, which began with the obscure, but futuristic looking Cheetah, to rest for good.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just over 30 years after the U.S. Air Force officially shuttered the super-secret 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron , or Red Eagles, and its fleet of Russian MiGs, the service has released a little film about the unit’s activities, also known as Project Constant Peg. It’s short, but it’s still full of interviews with pilots and ground crews about their work, as well as images and video of the squadron’s unique fleet of foreign planes. It offers additional insight into the world of U.S. military units charged with what is known as “ Foreign Materiel Exploitation ,” or FME, a service that the latest incarnation of the Red Eagles continues to provide to this day . The brief documentary, titled Red Eagles – Constant Peg, 1977-1988 , first appeared on social media accounts linked to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Nellis is presently home to some of the Air Force’s premier test and evaluation and research and development units, including the 57th Wing and 53rd Test and Evaluation Group . The base has also long served as an official home for units conducting top-secret work at various outlying installations, including the Tonopah Test Range Airport and Groom Lake, also known as Area 51 . The 4477th officially stood up at an airfield near the remote Tonopah Test Range on April 1, 1977, eventually bringing MiG-17 Fresco , MiG-21 Fishbed , and MiG-23 Flogger jets that the U.S. government had acquired by various means to the base. The squadron also acquired Chinese Chengdu J-7Bs , which are license-built MiG-21 copies. The squadron also flew T-38 Talon trainers , which acted, in part, as chase planes. They would’ve offered the Air Force an additional way to cover and obscure what the squadron was actually doing, as well. The Air Force initially had to expand the size of the airport at Tonopah to handle all of the new aircraft. “The whole idea of building an airfield was an overwhelming challenge,” retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Gail Peck, who commanded the 4477th between 1977 and 1978, says in the Air Force documentary. “I got to thinking about it and so I pulled out a ballpoint pen and a napkin off the airliner and I sketched out a little drawing of extending the runway and putting a pad there for three hangars and stuff like that. And I’d convinced myself that Tonopah was the right place for this project.” Colonel Peck’s napkin drawing of his proposed expanded base of operations at Tonopah., USAF capture The future home of the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron under construction., USAF capture Another shot of the construction at Tonopah at a more advanced state., USAF capture Peck says the site offered a host of advantages, including being remote to help conceal the squadron from prying eyes, but still in close proximity to Nellis, home of what was then the Air Force Fighter Weapons School, which is now known simply as the Weapons School . This basing decision was a direct product of the discussions that led to the unit’s creation, which revolved around the desire for a more established capability to both evaluate the capabilities of the Russian aircraft and give American fighter pilots regular opportunities to square off against them in dissimilar air combat training . Before the establishment of the 4477th at Tonopah, the Foreign Technology Division (FTD) of Air Force Systems Command had been primarily responsible for the MiGs. This organization performed FME on flyable and non-flyable foreign aircraft at Area 51 in cooperation with intelligence agencies such as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). A separate document the Air Force had previously declassified and posted online shows that this work included projects such as Have Foam and Have Pad, which involved the examination of the characteristics of the a crashed Sukhoi Su-20 Fitter and an airworthy MiG-23, respectively. This process included gathering intelligence about the performance of both aircraft and their various systems, as well as collecting information about the Soviet Union’s general industrial capabilities through metallurgical analysis of selected parts. Partially redacted descriptions of Projects Have Foam and Have Pad., USAF At the same time, as reports of mediocre performance on the part of U.S. Air Force and Navy fighter pilots against North Vietnamese MiGs began to flow in, flight operations out of Groom Lake eventually expanded to include limited aggressor training for U.S. Air Force and Navy fighter pilots, but as part of specific test programs. Have Drill , which pitted American aviators against an ex-Syrian Air Force MiG-17 captured in Israel, and Have Doughnut , involving a former Iraqi Air Force MiG-21 that the Israelis had acquired from a defecting pilot, are among the best-known examples. “I was in General [Hoyt S.] Vandenberg’s office [at the Pentagon] one day trying to get him to sign one of these test plans and he says ‘You know, I hate this,'” Peck recounts in the new documentary. “You guys have to go through the pain of writing a test plan. We oughtta just be training with these airplanes.” The MiG-17 that pilots flew against during Project Have Drill., USAF Thus the 4477th was born. The secret program’s name, Constant Peg, came from the combination of Vandenberg’s own callsign and the first name of Peck’s wife, Peggy. The Air Force also continued to exploit foreign aircraft and components at Area 51, eventually creating the 6513th Test Squadron , the Red Hats, to continue that work. The service also eventually assigned the cover designations F-110, F-113, and F-114, to the MiG-21s, MiG-23s, and MiG-17s, respectively, to avoid having to refer to them directly as foreign types. As already noted, the aircraft that the FTD had acquired for its purposes had come from various sources and were not all in flyable condition when the new squadron received them. So, it was often up to the 4477th’s maintainers to figure out the foreign designs after they arrived at Tonopah and get them ready to go. A grainy still image from a video showing some of the 4477th’s jets in a hangar at Tonopah., USAF capture “We had pieces. You know, we had airframes and wings and all that stuff, but flyable,” Retired U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant Don Lyon, Assistant Chief of Maintenace for the 4477th between 1977 and 1981, says in his own interview in the film. “It wasn’t that difficult to figure it out. I mean, it was a lot of reverse engineering, you know, but airplanes pretty much an airplane.” Whether this is true or just Lyon being modest, it was still an impressive feat for the Air Force ground crews to essentially rebuild airplanes they may not have ever seen before in person. It also doesn’t speak to the varied state of planes, and plane parts, that came to the unit. Not everything was as pristine as a MiG that had touched down at an Israeli air base. “They took airplanes that had been pulled out of swamps and deserts and God knows where they got ’em,” Peck says. “We didn’t even pre-flight ’em, we had that much trust in our maintenance team and they didn’t let us down.” Members of the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron. Retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Earl Henderson, who commanded the unit between 1979 and 1980, says in the documentary that Air Force relaxed grooming standards for the unit, especially for ground crews, to help them avoid arousing suspicions of a major influx of military personnel at Tonopah among people in surrounding communities., USAF capture During its official time in existence, the 4477th flew over 15,000 sorties and trained nearly 6,000 American pilots on how to fight actual Soviet MiGs. Those individuals then took their experience back to organizations such as the Air Force Fighter Weapon School and the Navy Fighter Weapon School, better known as TOPGUN , to further share that knowledge throughout their respective services. It’s hard to overstate the importance for pilots to be able to see how their aircraft perform against actual planes that a potential opponent might be flying. It also gives them a chance to overcome or at least reduce the chance of experiencing anxiety or “ buck-fever ” when seeing a foreign type for the first time in actual combat. US Navy F-14 Tomcats fly in formation with Constant Peg MiG-21s during a training sortie., USAF “You only had to watch the eyes of a fighter pilot joining up on you. He’s coming up in his airplane and the closer he gets, pretty soon you can see his helmet and you can see his head,” Peck explains in the film. “And pretty soon you can see his face and you can see his eyeballs peering at you over his oxygen mask, you know, and they’re getting bigger and bigger and bigger as he’s getting in closer and closer. He’s never seen a Russian airplane in flight for real! What an experience that is.” Though the 4477th is no more, the Air Force continues to conduct these types of FME and dissimilar air combat training activities using actual foreign airframes to this day. The squadron reportedly remained in existence at least two years after officially standing down and the Air Force only formally declassified its existence at all in 2006. Members of the 4477th pose in front of one of the squadron’s MiG-21s., USAF After a number of subsequent name and organizational changes, which you can read about more here , the latest incarnations of both the Red Eagles and Red Hats are both now understood to be under the control of the Air Force Test Center’s (ATFC) Detachment 3. This unit also has a close relationship to Nellis’ 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, Detachment 3, which has a public mission to conduct FME testing. In 2017, photographers David Atkinson and Alan Chadwick caught a glimpse of the Red Eagles and Red Hats continued work when he took a series of photos of a F-16D Viper, almost certainly based at Area 51, with an infrared search and track pod flying through Rainbow Canyon, also known “Star Wars Canyon” or the “Jedi Transition,” in Eastern California. The two pilots on board were clearly wearing Red Eagle and Red Hat patches on their flight suits. A picture of the F-16D flying through Star Wars Canyon in 2017.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 14, 2020",This U.S. Navy ‘Yellow Submarine’ Was A Target Shaped Like A North Korean Sub,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Images of what appeared to be a bright yellow submarine – with no sign of any Beatles on board – under tow off San Clemente Island, near San Diego, California, have recently been making the rounds online . As it turns out, the craft in question was actually a unique U.S. Navy test target with the same general size and shape as a North Korean Sang-O -class submarine. H.I. Sutton, author and expert on all things military that operate underwater, originally suggested that the target submarine might have been an actual captured Sang-O that had outlived its usefulness for technical exploitation and ended up in a destructive test in a post on his website on Feb. 6, 2019.  He has since corrected that piece, replacing it with a great, in-depth profile of what was actually known as the Weapon Set-To-hit Threat Target (WSTTT). The Navy began work on the WSTTT in San Diego in the 2002 Fiscal Year and had the mock submarine completed and delivered to the service’s Operational Test and Evaluation Force ( OPTEVFOR ) sometime between 2003 and 2004. The resulting craft was a full-size steel surrogate of a diesel-electric submarine, with the full program costing approximately $11 million in total, according to Sutton . The immediate impetus for building the target submarine was to support the development of the Mk 54 lightweight torpedo , as well as improvements to the Mk 48 heavyweight torpedo . Personnel could submerge the craft for testing and then raise it back up to recover it afterward. In 2004, the Navy released a pair of pictures showing a tug towing the WSTTT into position and crews then submerging it in place for just such a test in the Pacific Ocean near San Clemente Island . Navy personnel work to submerge the WSTTT ahead of a test in 2004., USN “The platform allows unarmed ASW [anti-submarine warfare] torpedos to impact it without any explosion,” a caption for one of the pictures in the October 2004 edition of All Hands , the Navy’s official magazine, explained. It’s not clear how much damage the target would still sustain from the physical impact of a warhead-less torpedo. By every indication, the approximately 115-feet long target submarine is a dead ringer for a Sang-O , but it is unclear why the Navy chose this particular design to base the target on. It’s certainly not a bad choice as it is the most numerous type in North Korean service and is capable of operating as a small, littoral attack submarine, as well as a platform for inserting special operations forces and clandestine operatives. In 1996, South Korea had captured one of these boats after it ran aground near the coastal town of Gangneung . The incident touched off a nearly 50-day manhunt. South Korean police captured one North Korean commando, who later defected. The North Korean Sang-O -class submarine that South Korea captured in 1996., Idobi via Wikimedia The rest of the infiltration team on the submarine apparently executed the boat’s crew, before attempting to continue with their mission. South Korean troops killed 13 more North Koreans in nine separate incidents, losing eight of their own in the process, while a 14th individual apparently escaped back to North Korea. The Sang-O is now on public display at Tongil Park near Gangneung. North Korean submarines continue to represent a significant threat to the South Koreans, as well as their American allies. One of North Korea’s submarines, such as one of the Sang-O -class boats, was likely responsible for the sinking of the South Korean Navy’s Pohang -class corvette Cheonan in 2010, which resulted in the deaths of 46 of the ship’s crew. Basing the WSTTT on a known threat would have certainly have given the U.S. Navy an opportunity to make the evaluations of the Mk 54 and improved Mk 48s more representative of potential real-world operations, as well as offer a chance to simply see how well either weapon might work against a Sang-O -sized target. The WSTTT pierside in San Diego in 2005., Bill Word via Flickr Whatever the case, the Navy’s time experimenting with the WSTTT turned out to be relatively brief. In 2006, she sank for real within the Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE) near San Clemente due to an unspecified malfunction during a test of a Mk 54 torpedo, according to Sutton. The next year, the Navy made plans to salvage it, but scrapped those plans due to budgetary constraints, according to an article in the July 2009 issue of Faceplate , the official newsletter of U.S. Navy divers and salvors. In January 2009, a Navy salvage team aboard the USNS Navajo had used the Deep Drone remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to inspect the wreck and assess its material condition in case the service wanted to make another attempt to raise it. There’s no indication the Navy has made any attempt to retrieve the WSTTT. A grainy screen capture of video that the Deep Drone ROV took of the sunken WSTTT in 2009., USN In 2011, the Navy took delivery of an entirely new target submarine called the Mobile Anti-Submarine Training Target ( MASTT ) from U.K. firm MSubs , which is now part of the U.S.-based Submergence Group . Around 75-feet long and weighting 65 tons, the electrically-powered MASTT is the largest known unmanned underwater vessel and is superior to the WSTTT in almost every respect and notably has the ability to operate under its own power. Personnel can maneuver it and change its depth remotely, making it even more flexible. With its lead-acid batteries fully charged, the unmanned target submarine has a maximum underwater range of more than 65 miles and a submerged cruising speed of around three-and-a-half miles per hour. MSubs’ Mobile Anti-Submarine Training Target., MSubs After receiving the MASTT, the Navy first sent it to the Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD), which is situated along a lake in landlocked Bayview, Idaho, for 11 months of testing and evaluation. This unusual and secretive facility is a key facility for the development of new Navy surface ships and submarines and you can read about it in more depth here . In 2012, the MASTT went to the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) in San Diego for additional tests, which is where the Navy had kept the WSTTT before it sank. The MASTT completed its final assessment in 2015. The unmanned submarine spent seven hours underwater during that 12-day evaluation, the longest it had ever been submerged, according to an article from CRUSER News , the newsletter of the Naval Postgraduate School. It also performed its longest single trip on the surface, covering approximately 15 miles. “This was the first time MASTT was operated without Original Equipment  Manufacturer support,” the test director for the Fleet Assessment, who the article did not name, told CRUSER News . “The team demonstrated the ability to independently operate, maintain, and troubleshoot the MASTT system while at-sea. They also showed they could rapidly reprogram the vehicle and change run parameters to meet customer requirements.” During the evaluation, an Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer and P-3C Orion patrol aircraft both demonstrated their ability to track the MASTT as if it were an actual threat submarine. There is no indication that they launched any practice or live weapon at the unmanned submarine during this testing, though. MASTT under test at the ARD in Bayview, Idaho. At left you can see the bow of the Sea Jet Advanced Electric Ship Demonstrator (AESD), a quarter-scale functioning model of a DDG-1000 Zumwalt -class stealth destroyer ., MSubs The Navy does not appear to have purchased any more target submarines since then, but this could change in the near future. The service is growing increasingly concerned about submarine developments around the world, especially among potential opponents such as Russian and China . Both of those countries are developing increasingly hard to detect diesel-electric designs with advanced air-independent propulsion systems , as well as nuclear-powered types . Many of these submarines are also available for export , expanding the potential pool of future submarine threats. In November 2018, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Charles Richards, the Navy’s Commander, Submarine Forces, announced his intention to establish a dedicated aggressor submarine squadron to focus on mimicking those potential threats in order to help train American attack submarine crews . Since the Navy does not presently operate any diesel-electric submarines of its own anymore , it might decide to purchase new manned or unmanned types to support these training exercises down the road. It could also hire firms such as MSubs and the Submergence Group to actually operate these submarines during drills, akin to the U.S. military’s growing use of contractor-owned and operated aircraft in aerial training exercises . The Navy’s yellow target submarine, however, looks set to stay right where it lies on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean near San Clemente Island.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 19, 2020",The Soviet’s ‘Golden Fish’ Missile Submarine Still Holds The Record As The World’s Fastest,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sixty years ago, Soviet engineers began developing a new submarine under strict orders to eschew previous design decisions in favor of innovative concepts wherever possible. The resulting boat, a guided missile submarine that was known first as K-162 and eventually as K-222, established a still-unbeaten underwater speed record and was the first titanium-hulled submarine ever, but also proved too expensive and complicated to be anything more than a one-off, earning the nickname “Golden Fish.” K-162/K-222, the only Project 661 submarine ever built, was the product of a direct order from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and country’s Council of Ministers on Aug. 28, 1958. The directive called for a new “high-speed submarine” and development began the following year. The Project 661 design was also known as the Anchar -class in the Soviet Union and NATO referred to it as the Papa -class, even though there was only ever one boat. The immediate impetus for the development of the Project 661 design was the limited capabilities and poor performance of the first generation of Soviet diesel-electric guided missile submarines, or SSGs. These early boats were conversions of Whiskey -class submarines , which were themselves derived from World War II-era Nazi U-boat designs. When work on the Project 661 submarine started, the Soviets had already separately begun development of new classes of purpose-built conventionally-powered guided missile submarines (SSGs) and nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs), the Project 651s and Project 659s respectively, which were also known as the Juliett – and Echo -classes in the West. But the goal for the new project was to produce an entirely novel cruise missile-carrying submarine that would be even more capable than either of these interim designs. The Soviet Project 651 or Juliett -class guide missile submarine K-77., USN The first major decision the designers made was to use titanium alloys for the submarine’s external and internal hulls rather than steel or aluminum. Titanium offered benefits in terms of its general strength and resistance to corrosion. Though titanium is also only weakly magnetic, this did not render the Project 661 immune to detection by aircraft with magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD) or magnetic mines. This is due to the presence of more magnetic metals in the alloy, as well as various other components inside the submarine itself. Compared to earlier Soviet submarines that still showed the influence of World War II-era designs, the hullform of the Project 661 was significantly different, featuring a rounded bow and a streamlined “split-feed” stern with twin propellers. The 1970s-era Project 949 SSGNs, or Oscar -class , would also use this same general arrangement. A Cold War-era photo of K-162/K-222 showing its rounded nose., USN A still from a Soviet-era film about the Project 661 submarine showing its twin screws. The shrouds around the propellers were no longer in place when the submarine entered service., Public Domain The Soviets had never had to build such large titanium alloy components. So, while fabrication of the first components for the Project 661 submarine began in 1962, the need to devise entirely new and complex manufacturing processes meant the submarine was not officially laid down until December 1963. Years later, during construction of the titanium alloy hulled Project 705 submarines, also known variously as the Lira -class or Alfa -class , workers reportedly had to craft the hull sections inside a shed filled with inert argon gas, requiring the use of cumbersome “moon suits” with their own air supply. For the Project 661 submarine, the Soviets also developed an advanced nuclear pressure water reactor, as well as a prototype lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) cooled design. LBE reactors have greater thermal efficiency and can operate at higher temperatures than water-cooled designs without risk of the coolant boiling off. Unlike other liquid metal-cooled reactor types, such as sodium or sodium-potassium designs, LBE does not react spontaneously with air or water, reducing the size and complexity of the entire coolant system and eliminating the risk of an explosion in the event of a leak. Unfortunately, LBE is also much more corrosive and has a higher melting point. This means this type of reactor typically has a shorter overall lifespan and there is a risk of the coolant solidifying if the reactor drops below a certain temperature, requiring significant power to keep it sufficiently warm at all times. Furthermore, as the coolant becomes irradiated over time, it forms highly radioactive polonium-210 – a substance dangerous enough to work as an assassination weapon – as a byproduct, making it especially hazardous to refuel the system or otherwise handle any contaminated components. K-162/K-222 underway., USN The Soviets ultimately opted to install two highly compact VM-5 pressure water reactors, despite their lower performance. Even so, each one of them produced up to 177 megawatts of power. By comparison, the Echo -class SSGNs had a single, earlier VM-A that only generated a maximum of 70 megawatts. The immense power from these reactors, combined with its lightweight, but strong titanium hulls, helped give the submarine a relatively blistering speed underwater. The Project 661 boat could cruise submerged at just shy of 44 miles per hour. It broke the world speed record for a submarine traveling undersea during its sea trials, reaching a maximum speed of more than 51 miles per hour. The U.S. Navy’s Los Angeles -class nuclear-powered attack submarines, improved variants of which remain service today , have an official top speed of 23 miles per hour when submerged. There have been reports that these boats can actually get up to around 35 miles per hour underwater. The latest American Virginia -class attack submarines have a publicly stated top submerged speed of around 29 miles per hour, but this is still significantly slower than the Project 661 design. The Soviet-era film below, though in Russian only, still offers an interesting look at K-162/K-222, its development, and the submarine in action. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2Hz7FUgnORs The main armament of the Project 661 submarine was 10 anti-ship cruise missiles. At the time construction of K-162 began, the Soviets did not have a weapon of this type that a submarine could fire while concealed underwater. Existing SSGs and SSGNs had to surface first, making them vulnerable during the firing sequence. So, they initiated the development of a new missile in parallel, which resulted in the P-70 Ametist , also known as the SS-N-7 Starbright. This weapon had a range of more than 35 miles and could carry a high explosive or nuclear warhead. A P-70 anti-ship missile on a display stand with its rocket booster on a separate rack in the foreground., Public Domain With these missiles and its extreme speed, the Soviets expected to use the Project 661 boats to intercept American carrier groups. Since the submarines could not reload their missile tubes, slotted into tubes between inner and outer hulls, at sea, they would have had to return to port to rearm. The design also had four torpedo tubes and room for a dozen torpedoes, primarily for self-defense. Unfortunately, the benefits of the Project 661’s design came at the price of extremely high cost and complexity. It took the Soviets almost six years from when they laid down K-162 in 1963 to get her commissioned. While the first Project 661 was under construction, the Soviets were also able to design the simpler steel-hulled, single-shaft Project 670 SSGN, or Charlie -class , lay down the first example in 1964, and have it commissioned in 1967. The Soviet Navy had commissioned five of these submarines before K-162 even entered service. An Indian Navy Charlie -class SSGN., USN The Soviets ultimately decided not to produce any additional Project 661 submarines. But despite being the only ship of her class, K-162 did enter operational service. However, she proved to be just as problematic at sea as she was to build. Her high speed exposed problems that other submarines have never experienced. At speeds over 40 miles per hour, turbulence along the hull created excessive noise, reportedly up to 100 decibels in some cases, louder than a truck driving by you , in certain places. For submarines, silence is key to survival . At its top speed, K-162 would also begin to suffer actual external damage from the force exerted on the hull. So, after joining the Soviet Union’s Northern Fleet in 1971, K-162 made relatively few operational patrols. For unspecified reasons, in 1978, the Soviets changed her hull number to K-222. It wasn’t until September 1981 that a U.S. Navy carrier-based anti-submarine warfare squadron even spotted the submarine during a cruise. The S-3 Vikings of now-inactivated Sea Control Squadron Three Zero (VS-30), the Diamondcutters, flying from the deck of USS Forrestal at the time, hold that honor . A pair of VS-30 Vikings in flight in September 1981, the same month they spotted the only Project 661 submarine out at sea., USN Given the Soviet’s own concerns about her acoustic signature, it seems unlikely that this was entirely a product of her going undetected for a decade. In July 1981, P-3 Orions of Patrol Squadron One Zero (VP-10), flying from Naval Air Station Keflavik in Iceland had also detected the submarine after it sailed into an area where NATO naval forces were conducting an exercise . This earned that unit a Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy. The lone Project 661 submarine saw the most action on the pages of Tom Clancey’s 1986 novel Red Storm Rising . The boat briefly appears in the book to conduct anti-convoy operations. The submarine’s biggest contribution appears to have been laying the groundwork for subsequent titanium-hulled nuclear-powered Soviet attack submarines, primarily the aforementioned Project 705 and the Project 945 , or Sierra -class. The Alfas also used LBE-cooled reactors derived from the design originally intended for the Project 661. The Alfa class boats were also capable of extremely high speeds, topping out around 47 miles per hour. But, while they were more successful than the sole Papa -class boat, they suffered from many of the same limitations, which you can read about in more detail here . They spent most of their time in port, poised to dart into the North Atlantic during a crisis. A Soviet Project 705 Alfa -class submarine., USN K-222 was gone from the active rolls of the Northern Fleet before the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1999, she was formally stricken and set to get scrapped. In a final testament to her effectively experimental design, in 2010 , the Zvezdochka Ship Repair Center, part of Russian shipbuilder Sevmash in Severodvinsk, began dismantling the submarine without removing her reactor or its reactive fuel first. At the time, the Russians were still in the midst of a selecting a consultant, via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to determine the best way of disposing of the boat’s radioactive components. K-162/K-222 inside a floating drydock ahead of scrapping in 2008., via u/ak-pk1 /Reddit The Kremlin reportedly went ahead with breaking down K-222 before worrying about what to do with the reactor or its fuel because the submarine’s design did not have any specific provisions for removing the reactor for servicing or other purposes, to begin with. It’s not clear what happened to either the reactor plant or any other components of the boat in the end. After more than six decades, the Project 661 design still holds the world record for the top submerged speed of any submarine. The boat was certainly an impressive feat of engineering, but given the problems it exposed with sailing this fast under the water, it seems unlikely that this record will get broken any time soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 15, 2019","USAF Commander Who Fired First Female Demo Team Leader Talks Mistakes, Redemption, And Leadership","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Derek “Maestro” O’Malley was a young fighter pilot rising quickly in the ranks when he decided to make a particularly crass gag video. What came next was nothing he ever imagined. All that he had worked for was suddenly at stake. But the Air Force gave him another chance, one that he ran with and has since achieved incredible heights of success, becoming the wing commander of the prestigious 20th Fighter Wing based at Shaw Air Force Base. Then, just days ago, it was his turn to make a disciplinary decision just like his superiors had in regards to his mistake a decade and a half ago. This one would be far more publicized. Now Colonel O’Malley relieved the first female demonstration team leader the Air Force ever had, Captain Zoe Kotnik , after just two weeks on duty. His decision made international headlines and the details surrounding it are still shrouded in secrecy. After the video he created years ago, which is infamous in the fighter pilot community, was published on this site in relation to the ongoing story about the dismissal of Zoe Kotnik, O’Malley made the decision to reach out to us to share his story publically for the first time. And an amazing and intimate one it is. It speaks to the failings in all of us and how it’s not necessarily how you fail, but how you redeem yourself and use your experiences, no matter how unpleasant, to become a better person and a more thoughtful leader. Judging by his responses alone, we need more people like O’Malley in the top echelons of the USAF’s leadership, ones who have learned to see the potential in people even when it is highly inconvenient to do so. For a force that is struggling to retain personnel, including pilots and maintainers —those who are absolutely critical to its core mission—giving people a second shot when it is possible to do so is really a necessity not a luxury. So, without further ado, here is my remarkable interview with the colorful commander of the 20th Fighter Wing: Can you tell us the entire story of how this video came about? I’ll start early just to give you context. I have an identical twin brother. His name is Colin O’Malley and he and I are very right-brained, creative people, we’ve got a very active sense of humor. In high school, I was the student body president, he was the vice president and we had our own “Colin and Derek O’Show” and we would do funny videos, so comedic videos and having a sense of humor, is something that’s been a big part of our lives. My brother is a professional composer and musician, he’s actually an orchestrator, Yanni’s primary orchestrator… He does a lot of work for Disney and television, so he’s very successful. He writes a lot of jingles as well The O’Malley brothers, identical twins! One a composer and orchestrator, the other one of the USAF’s top fighter pilots. Colonel O’Malley describes his close relationship with his brother and how they share in each other’s professional lives in creative ways: “Colin is three minutes older than I am. He was just here last week for our 20th Fighter Wing annual awards party. I put him in a flight suit and we did the “transported man” illusion in front of the entire Wing. I walked out a door on one side of the hanger and he walked in from another cross the hangar—creating the illusion that I transported. We blew people’s minds.”, Image Courtesy of Derek O’Malley With that background, I am now many years later, a young fighter pilot, a young captain in Kunsan Air Base, Korea. That’s a one-year remote assignment, so you’re there without your family in a very remote location. It’s a lot of fun, but it’s a very different environment. In Korea, of course, it’s very humid and it’s a very high operations tempo, so we’re flying a lot . There’s a lot of big exercises as you’re practicing being in a high state of readiness in case something happens in Korea, and as we fly out over the Yellow Sea, we have to wear anti-exposure suits. And these are, you know, effectively dry suits. And they’re very hot. When you’re flying you’re okay, but you can imagine wearing these in the hot summer in Korea? So, Gold Bond powder is a primary product. One day I’m talking to some of my fellow fighter pilots and we’re joking about Gold Bond, I just started talking to them—”Hey we should do a little commercial.” As the Chief of Weapons and Tactics—I was the chief instructor in the squadron—I’m in charge of all the upgrades and making sure everybody is the best they can be, I’ve been through our equivalent of Topgun to the Air Force, the U.S. Air Force Weapons School. So, I’m in a very prominent role there in the squadron to lead these fighter pilots. When your weapons officer says “Hey let’s make a commercial” everybody jumps says “Yeah that sounds like a great idea.” So, I told my brother about Gold Bond, and he came up with the jingle that you hear in the video, which is very catchy. And that’s him singing on there, so he composes that and sends it to me there in Korea, and I play it for everybody and it’s a big hit. That morning, Saturday morning, I get everybody up and we’re there in our dorms, and we filmed the little commercial that you saw. In every fighter squadron on Fridays, you usually get together and you’ll tell stories about flying from the week. Mistakes people made, funny stories, those kinds of things, and then we’d show funny things like the Gold Bond video. I showed the video, it was a big hit, everybody laughed, and then that’s the end of it, it was not ever intended to go anywhere else of course. This is pretty much pre-YouTube at that time right? It is. I think YouTube was just emerging, but certainly, the notion of a viral video is not a term that any of us had heard yet. This is late 2004 timeframe. Eventually, this video gets in the hand of our rival squadron and they start sending it to each other. And then it gets emailed all across the base and then very quickly gets emailed all across the Air Force, and quickly spreads. You know, it becomes truly a viral video. I was actually traveling home, it was around December time frame, going home for Christmas. You get a mid-tour when you’re there in Korea to go home, and as I’m walking through the airport somewhere in the United States, I see on somebody’s laptop the video playing . And I remember looking at the guy I was traveling with saying “Uh-oh, I think I might be in trouble.” Because we just had no idea that the video would go outside the squadron. And now here I am, across the world, and it’s on somebody’s laptop! So, at that point, I got the sense of how big of an issue this was. Of course, you’ve seen it, it doesn’t represent the Air Force the way I want to represent the Air Force, it doesn’t represent me the way I want to represent myself.  As they should have, the Air Force looked into it, they weren’t happy with the video, and I definitely got in some trouble. I won’t go specifically into the punishment that I received, but I definitely got in trouble, to the point where I had to work hard to recover. I remember when I was called into the Wing Commander’s office, there to receive my punishment. I looked at him said “Sir I’m so sorry, this is totally my fault. Please don’t punish all the other guys that were in this. They followed their Weapons Officer into this, so please just let me take the brunt of it.” And for the most part, that’s what happened. I was grateful that they let me own that. A picture from Maestro’s earlier days of flying F-16s., Colin O’Malley After my one-year assignment in Korea I’d been invited to go teach at our Weapons School, which is very prestigious—our F-16 Weapons School. Weapons School is the Air Force’s version of Topgun where you graduate you get the trophy and you get invited back as an instructor. That is what I had been given the opportunity to do. Once this video broke, the Air Force was considering changing my assignment and was really looking hard at what they were going to do with me. Fortunately, they ended up letting me go to Nellis, to the Weapons School to be an instructor. When I got to Nellis, my Wing Commander pulled me aside and said “You know Maestro, if you work hard, you’re going to be able to redeem yourself from this. So, just put your nose to the ground and get to work and be the best instructor officer you can be, and we’re going to put all this behind you.” And I really appreciated that, and I took him at his word, and I worked really hard at the Weapons School, won many awards there as a top instructor, used a lot of my video skills for the forces of good—I did a lot of videos for the Air Force and for the Weapons School that to this day are still used there. I just tried to really prove to the Air Force that this was not who I was and that I was willing to do what I had to do to make things right. I remember during all this, I would get a lot of emails from people that were angry about the video and I didn’t blame them. I remember one, in particular, was from a commandant of cadets at an ROTC detachment at a college and he wrote me on my government email and said “If this is the Derek O’Malley that did this video, you just took us back 30 years. Please keep this junk off the internet, you’re really shaming the Air Force, shame on you.” That was an eye-opening email to me, so I wrote him back and I still have the email to this day. It’s something I read, and I remember when I shared this with my squadron at a commander’s call I read the letter to them. Not only what he had said, but my response to him. I explained “I lead men and women in combat, I’m a Weapons Officer, I have a Distinguished Flying Cross, I’ve done all these things, and I should’ve known better. Maybe it is easier to dismiss me as an officership failure. And I don’t blame you if you do. Fortunately, the men and women I’ve led into combat, and now lead recognize that good people, even great people, make mistakes. Maybe that’s the best lesson for your cadets. Regardless of our intentions with this video, I take full responsibility.” He wrote me back and thanked me and shared the message with his cadets. It’s been a memorable lesson for me. It’s shaped the way I handle command, and the way I handle Airmen that make mistakes under my command. Next, I was selected to the F-35 initial cadre. At this point, I definitely was in a position where from an Air Force perspective I was on the road to full recovery and I had the opportunity to do wonderful things. I was flying the F-35 at Nellis and I was commanding an operational test squadron that was testing the F-35 along with other aircraft, and this was around the time when General Welsh [Air Force Chief Of Staff at the time] implemented what I’ll call a cultural revolution across the Air Force, but particularly in fighter pilot circles. He pulled all the wing commanders together and said “It’s time to clean up the crudeness and some of the things that have been propagating across our culture. This isn’t the environment that we want.” He knew it wasn’t how we wanted to represent ourselves as the Air Force and he took the initiative to correct it. Maestro in the F-35A., Image Courtesy of Derek O’Malley I remember my Wing Commander talking to all the squadron commanders explaining “Hey, we need to straighten up, clean this stuff up in your squadrons, and get back to the professional environment that we need. Doesn’t mean we can’t have fun, but there are some lines that we just shouldn’t be crossing.” I remember standing up in front of my squadron and telling them the changes that were happening, the things that we weren’t going to do anymore, and that we never should have been doing. And I shared with them this entire experience as I’m sharing it with you, because I wanted them to hear it from me, and then to know that these changes that General Welsh was rolling out, that I believed in them. That I knew that they were important and that I wasn’t just spouting the party line and then saying “Oh, wink wink, I’m the Gold Bond guy, we’re going to keep doing things the way we always did it on the side here.” I’ve done that same thing at every level of command and shared the same experience. We all do things that are stupid sometimes, but in the business that we do here in the Air Force, we’ve got to have an environment where everybody feels safe. And I feel like anything that I did in the past, or that we all did without even realizing it, that made this environment feel unsafe, or a place where people didn’t want to work, was wrong. We’ve got to get away from that. I’m grateful for the changes that I’ve seen across the Air Force in that respect. When you talk to younger pilots under your command about your experience, you have a bunch of them there at Shaw AFB, what’s their reaction? Just recently when I first took command, I sat down and did an all call with the pilots and officers and shared this story. This video, at least in the fighter pilot world, while I’m not happy about it, is well-known. There’s probably not an F-16 pilot in the Air Force that doesn’t know of that video and that I did it. So, when I became the Wing Commander, I thought it was important to discuss it with the pilots. I shared it with them and it was a good opportunity to be real, to show them that I still have a sense of humor and that we can have fun and joke around and be human. But at the same time, we’ve got to remember that we should hold ourselves to a higher standard. I felt like that resonated. I’m not telling them to change who they are, I just want them to recognize that who we were before isn’t who we want to be anymore, we’re better than that now. “Here’s a shot of me executing a fake sneeze when someone was trying to take my official photo.  Humor has always been one of my primary leadership weapons.” , Image Courtesy of Derek O’Malley Are airmen being systematically trained to realize the pitfalls of this type of thing? Is there just a training video they see or are they actually hearing about stories like yours in context to the current environment that’s out there right now, especially in regards to social media? The Air Force core values and the way we train people to conduct themselves would lead you towards “Hey let’s not post ridiculous stuff about ourselves on the internet.” And I think there are enough examples out there like mine that people know “I probably shouldn’t do that.” I also think our young officers are way smarter on social media than any of us are. Hearing it from people that are just repeating a message is one thing, hearing it from someone like you has an entirely different impact. If I was a young airman, I’d listen to this and say “Hey this is where I want to be in ten years, and after hearing this, yeah I wouldn’t pick up the camera and do that.” Maybe there’s a greater opportunity here? I agree, and when I share this story, it isn’t just about social media and how you communicate on those platforms. For me, it’s broader. It’s about recognizing that every one of us has done something we regret. And you can learn from it, you can move on. Don’t forget that you’re not defined by the mistakes you make unless you choose to let them define you.” Image Courtesy of Derek O’Malley So, on second chances. This is your story and obviously there’s an issue that’s ongoing. In your letter that you published [about removing Zoe Kotnik from her command] I believe you said that you hope that the individual takes the best advantage of a second chance or something along those lines. Is that something that is your position or do you see that more of as an Air Force position? I wrote every word of that, that was not a prepared statement that anybody gave me, it is absolutely how I feel and embodies the way I lead. That was right from the heart. What goes into making a disciplinary decision? How does the process work? For most issues on Shaw Air Force Base—the 20th Fighter Wing—I am what we call the ‘convening authority.’ So, I have jurisdiction on what happens. But the Air Force widely tries to push autonomy and decisions down to the lowest level possible. For example, I have 18 squadrons in my wing and those squadron commanders handle their own disciplinary actions within the squadron. They don’t funnel that all to me. It’s only when we’re talking about more significant offenses, where maybe somebody might get discharged, those kinds of things, that it starts to come up to a higher level. You have this experience in your past, yet look how far you’ve come. I’ve read your resume, it is filled with some of the most incredible flying positions the Air Force has to offer. Today you command thousands of people on one of the service’s most important bases. What advice can you give those that find themselves in a ‘Gold Bond’ like predicament now? Not just in regards to not doing something stupid, but after the fact, once a bad decision has already been made? What can they do to make the best out of a bad situation? That’s a great question. I’ll just talk broadly instead of talking about specific situations, but I can think of several cases here since I’ve been a wing commander where I’ve had someone in my office because something didn’t go well for them. And of course, when you’re coming to the wing commander’s office and you’ve done something wrong, you’re fearful. They are worried about what’s going to happen. One of my favorite memories here in the wing was a time where a young man came into my office who made some significant mistakes, and I suspect he thought that his career was over. I sat there and talked to him, I was very stern and I think he thought “Okay here we go.” I paused for a second and I held up what was potentially a discharge letter, and I tore it up right in front of him and I said “You know what? I believe in you, and my Command Chief believes in you, and your Squadron Commander believes in you. I want you to go back down to your squadron, I want you to learn from this, I want you to put it behind you, and I want you to move on and be the best Airman that I’ve ever seen in this wing. Prove to us that we made the right decision.” That’s the message, right? I think it’s so important to have a commander, and I hope my commanders embody this, it can’t just be me, where we see the best in people. So, even when people do things that are just bad sometimes, we look at them and we see through that and we see past it and we recognize that there is so much potential here that we need to harness. That is how I approach it. From the Airmen’s point of view, as I interact with them, it’s important that they can see themselves in me. If I’m always perfectly articulate and don’t show any vulnerability, I think it makes me seem unreachable. Nobody can relate to that. I want them to see that we’re very much the same and that there is no reason they can’t be a wing commander or whatever else they want to become. So, I start there. I sit down with them. I call them by their first name. I ask them about their family, their interests, their goals. Now getting directly to your question, I tell them I know what it feels like to think that you’ve disappointed everyone that believes in you and that you’ve destroyed your career. And the easiest thing to do right now is to give up. But we need leaders in our Air Force that know what it’s like to be in their shoes. We need leaders that can look beyond a mistake or a momentary lapse in judgment and see the hidden potential in our Airmen. That’s the kind of leader I want them to become, so I ask them if they’ll take the steps necessary to put their mistakes behind them and join me in the revolution. Some say this is a one mistake Air Force. Not on our watch! “Here are a couple photos of me and my Dad. The black and white photo is him when he was stationed at Shaw as an aircraft maintenance officer. He’s the reason I became a fighter pilot, and we were very close. He died just a few weeks ago. It is very special for me to command the base where my Dad was once stationed. Our last time together (other than in the hospital), was when he was here to watch me take command this past summer.”   , Image Courtesy of Derek O’Malley Obviously, it’s not easy in the internet age where social media can keep circulating something that you find personally and professionally unpleasant. But you combated this for years, didn’t you? I thought to myself “Once something is on the internet it never goes away.” People always say that and I thought “Is that really true?” I mean of course an EMP, that could wipe it out, but that’s not an option! So, I did some research on copyright and realized that I had grounds to have it copyrighted. In fact, even by making the video I already had the copyright of it. But just to make it official I filed a copyright, I have the certificate to this day, and for the past fourteen years, every month, maybe twice a month, I go through the internet and I do ‘Gold Bond cleanings.’ I find the video and I reach out with the DMCA notices and I have it taken down. This thing pops up probably every month, I’ll see at least one, and I just snipe it.  I’ve spent hundreds of hours over the past 14 years suppressing this video! And it’s funny because you’ll see commentary on the internet, maybe you did as you researched this story. People think the government is doing this and the Air Force is somehow involved in this big conspiracy to keep ‘Gold Bond’ off the internet. Little do they know it’s just little old me. I don’t do this because of my Air Force career, I received my punishment and I had the opportunity to recover. It’s never been about preserving my career, and I always knew eventually it could come out as it did this week, but I had a young son at the time, he’s 18 now, and I challenged myself thinking “I don’t want him to come across this.” And I did, I kept it away from him, he didn’t see it until he turned 18 and I finally showed it to him.  He actually didn’t think it was that funny. He was disappointed after all those years. I guess I overhyped it. There is another video of me on the internet that ties to my twin brother. As you may know in the fighter pilot world we have callsigns, you get a nickname and it’s kind of who you are. My call sign is ‘Maestro.’ And that’s based on my twin brother being a Maestro… And that’s just another one that’s out there. I haven’t tried to suppress that one. At this point, why even chase it anymore? Why not let people learn from it? You’re a man of very high stature, you’ve done amazing things in your life and are clearly a huge asset to the USAF. What’s there to hide from? It’s an inspiration to people who do make a mistake and look to come back from it to go on to incredible success. Yeah, it does change things now. This is very different, this is the first time someone has publicly told the whole story. While I’m not proud of the video, I wouldn’t trade the lessons I learned from those experiences. I wouldn’t be the father, friend, Airman or leader I am today without them. As I look at the video now, I am grateful that’s not who we are as an Air Force anymore. Still, young Captain O’Malley should have known better. I’m grateful that my leaders saw something in me that was worth saving and gave me a chance to reach my full potential. That’s exactly what I will do every single day I have the privilege of leading Airmen. But you’re right this does change things.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",US Spy Plane Pilot’s Account Indicates Soviet Russia Tested A ‘Dome Of Light’ Superweapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Veteran Air Force pilot Robert Hopkins, who is also the author of one of my favorite reference books, The Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker : More Than a Tanker, flew RC-135S Cobra Ball missile tracking planes during the twilight of the Cold War. Cobra Ball was one of America’s most important intelligence-gathering assets as it collected high-fidelity data on adversary ballistic missile tests. The flights were critical to U.S. national security with many missions originating out of the highly remote and windswept Shemya Air Force Base in the Aleutian Island chain and aimed at spying on Russian ballistic missile test launches. ​ ​​​ On two of these flights, while monitoring tests of Russia’s SS-20 Saber intermediate-range ballistic missile, Hopkins and his copilot experienced something incredibly bizarre. It was a phenomenon that ended up drawing extreme interest from America’s intelligence community, which thought the RC-135S had encountered a new secret weapon that could alter the strategic balance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Robert Hopkins has been kind enough to share his recollections of encountering the aptly named ‘Dome Of Light’ with us. The following account is in his own words: “Sometime during late 1988, most likely October or November, my crew from the 24th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, 6th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Eielson AFB, Alaska, was at Shemya AFB, Alaska, for a routine two-week deployment. During a sortie in the sensitive area east of the Kamchatka Peninsula near the USSR, we were notified that the Soviets had launched an SS-20 Saber (RDS-10 Pioneer) missile toward the Kura Test Range at Klyuchi . Kamchatka Peninsula where the Kura Test Range is located. , Google Maps This was part of the “shoot-to-destruction” provision of the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the US and the Soviet Union. This allowed for the destruction of 72 of 650 of the now-prohibited intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) by launching them from a known test facility to a known impact site with unimpeded observation by national technical means (NTM) of verification. In this case, the NTM was the RC-135S Cobra Ball flown by my crew. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Tfg1vW4zRUE Using a variety of optical and telemetry sensors, the RC-135S collected measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) and telemetry intelligence (TELINT) used to verify compliance with international arms agreements and to assess the maturity and development of foreign ballistic missile systems. As our crew prepared for the re-entry of the SS-20’s three re-entry vehicles (RVs), we climbed to our prescribed collection altitude and began our timing track to ensure that the right side of the airplane—where all the sensors were located—was pointed toward the re-entry event to the west of our orbit (later versions of the Cobra Ball are “ambidextrous” and can collect from either side). RC-135S Cobra Ball at Shemya Air Force Base circa the late 1980s., Robert Hopkins The autopilot was connected to the Litton LN-20 stellar-inertial -Doppler system for precise positioning (within six feet) of the airplane, and the second navigator used traditional plotting to back up the LN-20, as well as confirm our presence in international airspace at least 40nm, well beyond the Soviet territorial limit of 12nm. The stars were out that night and I don’t recall any moonlight, so we anticipated a nice light show by the RVs as they re-entered the atmosphere. As with any “take,” or collection, there was a general buzz of excitement as the back-end crew verified that their sensors and recorders were fully operational and ready for what would be less than a minute of valuable intelligence. RC-135S with its signature black wing. Notice the sensors are all amassed on the jet’s right side. , USAF The other pilot and I looked out ahead and to the left to clear for any potential conflicting traffic. While on an operational sortie the Cobra Ball did not file a flight plan, use its transponder/identification-friend or foe (IFF), or its navigation lights (although its storied black right wing supposedly prevented glare and the nav lights from affecting the sensors, by this time the sensors were able to collect without this adverse effect). Instead, the Cobra Ball flew using the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) “due regard” procedures where the pilots were responsible for the safety of our aircraft and any others it might encounter. As we looked for traffic, we noticed what appeared to be a translucent, milky white wall moving from the left, over the USSR, to the right, toward the Northern Pacific Ocean. It covered the entire sky from ground level to as far up as we could see looking out the front windows of the airplane. It moved very quickly—far faster than crossing airplane traffic—and rapidly approached us. The wall of light passed across our flight path and then continued eastward, leaving the empty and dark night sky in its wake. Our programmed turn time arrived and we began our bank to the left to collect on the RVs. Once we rolled out southbound the wall of light was no longer visible to the east. RC-135S refueling from KC-135 tanker., USAF After the mission, the other pilot and I discussed what we had seen and could offer no explanation. As we had both seen it, we concluded that it was not a hallucination and was likely some kind of auroral event neither of us had ever seen, despite their common presence at the high latitudes where we routinely operated. Interestingly enough, the same pilot and I saw the phenomenon again, behaving in the same fashion and, coincidentally, also prior to the collection for an SS-20 launch. By this time there was official interest in this event, which had now acquired the name “Dome Of Light.” This accurately described its appearance as a flash of light that began at the SS-20 launch site and then radiated outward in all directions at high speed. Guesses as to the velocity of the Dome Of Light were determined by the time it took the SS-20 to travel from the launch site at either Drovyanaya or Kansk to Klyuchi. This yielded a back-of-the envelope speed around 6,200mph! Scientists at the Air Force’s Foreign Technology Division (FTD) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, could not explain the origin or purpose (if there was one) for the Dome Of Light. Some concluded it was caused by special fuel used in the first stage of the SS-20. Others argued that it was something external to the SS-20’s propulsion system (or possibly a part of its transporter-erector-launcher or TEL) that provided an initial flash of light designed to temporarily blind US defense warning satellites that detected foreign missile launches or a pulse that would interfere with incoming warheads. FTD placed the highest collection priority on SS-20 launches and even planned one mission over the Sea of Okhotsk to attempt collection from “behind” the dome as it passed by, but this produced no meaningful results. The wide array of sensors installed on the RC-135S’s forward fuselage. , FAS.ORG While researching the section on aerial intelligence related to ballistic missile launches for the first volume of my 2016 book Spyflights and Overflights : US Strategic Aerial Reconnaissance , vol. 1, 1945-1960 , I came across two references to the Dome Of Light, but neither had any scientific or military explanation beyond what we had been told at the time. The best I have been able to determine was that in the post-Soviet ‘glasnost’ world, the Russians knew what the Dome Of Light was, but were not saying. With research underway in anticipation of the 2021 release of Spyflights vol. 2, 1960-1992 , I would really like to determine what the Dome Of Light was all about.” ​ ​​​ What Hopkins describes is truly fascinating and the fact that there still doesn’t appear to be an official answer as to what caused this phenomenon and why exactly it existed makes the story all the more intriguing. We did some abbreviated searching of our own and found a couple unique mentions of such a capability. Keep in mind, when we say “Dome Of Light” we don’t mean the localized and often quite pretty looking trails left behind from a rocket’s boosters. This is an established and well-understood byproduct of launches under certain conditions and they don’t have similar characteristics as what Hopkins describes in his first-hand account. In the case of the Dome of Light, three sources, in particular, seem to allude to some sort of weapon system that is meant to foil American surveillance and/or anti-ballistic missile defenses, which were an incredibly contentious topic in the ‘Star Wars’ era of the Reagan administration . A Los Angeles Times piece from January 24th, 1988 talks about the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty—coincidentally, the same one that was just shredded —and the issues surrounding Russia’s compliance with it. The article mentions specifically a Dome Of Light system used to mask a first strike launch, presumably at least in part by blinding America’s space-based infrared early warning satellites : Helms [Then-North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms] went on to dispute an unnamed “high White House official” for saying in defense of the new treaty that the Soviets would gain “no militarily significant advantages” through cheating, possibly by hiding SS-20 missiles. “Unclassified estimates for years have assumed that the SS-20 force was close to and even over 1,000,” the analysis said. “Yet the Soviets in the Memorandum of Understanding accompanying the INF Treaty have declared that they have only 650. . . . If U.S. intelligence is correct, then the Soviets are already violating the treaty obligations and we can assume they intend to cheat on a massive scale.” Hidden SS-20s could be used for a “surprise party,” Helms said, a sudden disclosure of nuclear force aimed at coercion of the NATO allies; to carry chemical or biological warfare agents, or to create a “dome of light” masking a nuclear first strike. A Helms aide, speaking on condition that he not be identified, declared that there is “a sea change under way in the Senate, enough that the treaty may be dead on arrival.” An issue of the Executive Intelligence Review dated just a month later also mentions the Dome Of Light capability by name, stating: There are at least three uses for a covert fleet of SS-20s [each of which] could have a tragic, catastrophic effect upon the United States and NATO. 1. The Surprise Party: a sudden revelation of covert, massive, over-kill capability to force the United States and NATO to accept decisive geostrategic changes. 2. Chemical and Bacteriologial [sic; Bacteriological] Warfare: the MIRVed warhead is ideal for the strategic dispersal of chemical, bacteriological, and biological agents from a distance that would not contaminate Soviet troops. 3. The “Dome of Light’: a temporary ABM effect, already tested, which could ‘shield the launch of a first strike. Dome Of Light comes up again, this time in relation to legendary scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla. In a story that first appeared in Omni Magazine in March of 1988 there is a direct reference to the possibility that Russia had used Tesla’s ideas to create a Dome Of Light weapon system: As extreme as some of these ideas seem, at least they are confined to the realm of the possible. But among those trying to revive Tesla’s ideas are some whose claims stretch the borders of the credible. A typical member of the radical fringe is Tom Bearden, a retired lieutenant colonel who works as a weapons analyst for an aerospace company. For years he has been collecting reports of unexplained explosions such as a 1976 sighting in Afghanistan of “gigantic, expanding spheres of light” emanating from “deep within the Soviet Union.” Bearden claims there has been a “Soviet weaponization” of one of Tesla’s pet notions, which he himself has dubbed “scalar electronics.” By combining and focusing electromagnetic and gravity waves, he says, one can make incredibly potent weapons. He is certain this is what Nikita Khrushchev was referring to 25 years ago when he announced the Russians had a fantastic weapon that could destroy life on Earth. Today, Bearden says, the Soviets have a whole arsenal of scalar armaments. These include a scalar howitzer, which is supposed to have generated a series of loud booms off the east coast of the United States in the late Seventies, and something resembling an ultrapowerful laser, which Bearden holds responsible for the temporary blinding of several American satellites. He’s among a number who claim that an enormous mushroom cloud and dome of light seen over the Pacific in 1984 by the crews of three commercial airliners was not the aftermath of a Soviet rocket launch but was made by something else — perhaps a scalar weapons test. Bearden’s ideas have attracted little interest and less sympathy from knowledgeable mainstream scientists. “Yes, I wasted an evening listening to him once,” admits physicist John Rather, a pioneer star-wars researcher. “His physics is pure nonsense. And so are his ideas about the Russians.” The plausibility of what is mentioned in the Omni article isn’t as important as the fact that a weapon of similar capability was being openly discussed during the same year that Hopkins experienced the Dome Of Light firsthand and was aware of the U.S. intelligence community’s high interest in its possible existence. Beyond all of this being of major historical significance, as it basically points to Russia having, or at least attempting to employ some sort of missile defense countermeasure superweapon during the last years of the Cold War, it also has great relevance today as we enter into a new Cold War of sorts. Today, Russia is just as sensitive toward America’s push for advanced missile shield as it was in the late 1980s. With major treaties disintegrating and new weapons entering into the fray, including hypersonic ones that fly at extreme velocities within the earth’s atmosphere, Russia is surely very interested in being able to blind America’s space-based early warning and missile tracking layer. The Pentagon is now working hard at adding to this layer in significant ways, including creating a sensor constellation that can track missiles during their midcourse phase of flight. In addition, actually weaponizing space with American anti-missile capabilities is looking more likely to become a reality in the not so distant future. Maybe all this will spur Russia to revisit their Dome Of Light concept once again if it did indeed exist some three decades ago. Russia already seems to be quite comfortable with pursuing super weapons as a way to attempt to level the strategic playing field with the United States. Dome Of Light could just be added to the list if it is indeed a viable concept. In the end, with Hopkins’ rich account of his encounters with the Dome Of Light while commanding RC-135S Cobra Ball missions to track SS-20 launches, it seems like Russia did indeed at least test such an exotic countermeasure system. How it worked and if it actually was effective in any way remain a mystery that we think is well worth looking in to on a deeper level. We will be sure to let you know if we find out more about Russia’s mysterious Dome Of Light as our investigation unfolds.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 24, 2019",A-4 Skyhawks Had These Crazy Thermal Shields To Protect Pilots From Nuclear Blasts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. So much odd, but awesome tech came out of the Cold War. It seems like every day I find something new that is equally fascinating and alarming about an era when nuclear Armageddon seemed consistently immanent. The nimble little A-4 Skyhawk’s clamshell thermal shield is a great example of this. The ‘Scooter’s’ Thermal Anti-Radiation Heat Shield was fitted around the edges of the rear portion of its notoriously cozy cockpit during nuclear missions. The clamshell design could be pulled down, covering the pilot entirely, but allowing them to still see the instrument panel and access the flight controls. The system would not only keep the pilot from being blinded by the super-bright flash of a nuclear explosion , but it would also give them shielding against the high heat that resulted from it, and to a lesser extent, it would lower the overall amount of other forms of radiation the they would be exposed to. Public Domain The shields were deployed operationally aboard aircraft carriers, along with tactical nuclear gravity bombs that the Skyhawks would haul into a combat zone and loft at targets before escaping the area as fast as possible. Lay-down and medium to high altitude dive bombing methods were also available, but less desirable, especially the latter. Here is a U.S. Navy video circa 1959 explain how the subsonic A-4 would use each of these methods to deliver a nuclear weapon: https://youtube.com/watch?v=IegvK4k-rng The need to protect pilots from the bright and hot flashes of nuclear weapons detonations resulted in a variety of solutions throughout the Cold War. These included nuclear thermal curtains installed on aircraft like the B-52s and the Polarized Lead Zirconium Titanate (PLZT, pronounced “plizzit”) flash blindness goggles introduced in the early 1980s for FB-111, B-52, KC-135, B-1, and eventually B-52 crews. Today, the B-2 uses a temporarily installed fast-tinting shield system mounted on its instrument panel dash that is based on technology originally developed for the B-1B to protect its crew during nuclear missions. You can read all about these wild contraptions in this past article of ours . An early prototype of the PLZT system designed for the B-1B., Public Domain But for the size of the Skyhawk and the era in which it entered into service, the thermal shield was an amazingly simple, easy to use, and highly effective countermeasure. A Douglas A-4E Skyhawk of USN attack squadron VA-44 Hornets showing the thermal shield in different positions. The device was to be used after the delivery of a nuclear weapon, so that the pilot would be protected against the flash of the detonation., US Navy Other tactical aircraft from the era employed various thermal shielding techniques, with most using more malleable curtain assemblies and less than ergonomic helmet systems , although photos of these configurations are rare. Here’s one design tested in an F-106 cockpit: Public Domain The need for such a system was fairly pressing in the era when the A-4 entered service. Whenever a U.S. carrier would get into an area where they would be part of the Single Integrated Operational Plan ( SIOP ), the shields were at the ready for installation along with nuclear gravity bombs or aircraft were preconfigured and armed at the ready for contingency missions. A-4 with a Mk7 nuclear bomb under its belly aboard USS Saratoga . , USN By the late 1960s, the A-4 gave up its nuclear role, but would continue to serve the Navy in various roles for decades after. Still, throughout the Cold War, American carriers would house tactical nuclear weapons onboard. Some set sail with over 100 nuclear bombs in their weapons magazines. A number of these weapons were lost at sea during the period. The practice only came to an end in 1992 after President George H.W. Bush commanded the draw-down of all tactical nuclear weapons from the surface warfare community. By 1994, even the ability to fire nuclear weapons would be forfeited by U.S. Navy ships, with the submarine force taking over the role completely. End of an era: B61 and B57 nuclear weapons are displayed on board the USS America (CV-66) during its deployment to Operation Desert Storm in 1991., USN via FAS.org In 2010, the ability for submarines to fire nuclear-tipped Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles also came to end. All this could change once again as the Navy looks to bring tactical nuclear weapons back to its surface and submarine fleets as part of a new Pentagon strategy to counter threats from Russia and China. It is even possible that the F-35C will gain nuclear capabilities in the coming years. It’s unclear how its pilot would be shielded if the type gained a nuclear capability, but it’s not like making the jet able to fight in nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare environments isn’t already a key component of the program. Relegating delivery to the lay-down method alone and/or using long fusing times is another possibility, giving the aircraft as much time as it needs to safely exit the danger zone. Regardless, it’s clear that Douglas designers were very concerned with the ability for A-4 pilots to execute the nuclear delivery mission in a number of ways and survive to fly again the next day. Looking back, the thermal anti-radiation heat shield appears to have been a fairly clean and ergonomic way of going about for the period.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 28, 2019",Nellis AFB Wing Boss Talks To Us About His Novel Aggressor Paint Job Facebook Contest And More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new aggressor paint scheme is bound to grab the attention of the military aviation community. They are always covered closely here at The War Zone. In recent years, both the Air Force and the Navy have put out stunning new paint jobs , many of which closely replicate the schemes worn by potentially hostile fighter jets that America’s front-line pilots could face in combat zones overseas. Sometimes these paint jobs emerge out of nowhere, other times they are rumored to be in the works. But never before has one been chosen from a structured crowd-sourcing contest on social media, at least until now. This is exactly what Brigadier General Robert Novotny did on his Facebook account over the last couple of months. Instead of internally developing a new scheme for one of the 64th Aggressor Squadron’s Block 32 F-16C/D Vipers, he co-opted his followers on Facebook and ran what ended up being a totally unconventional, but highly successful and engaging interactive contest. This resulted in an exciting new look for one of the squadron’s aggressor jets, and one that is ripped from the flight line of one of America’s most prominent adversaries. The War Zone did an article about the contest as it was unfolding, which serves as a good primer on the topic which you can read in full here . After writing that article, we kept an eye on the contest as it progressed. Once it wrapped up, we reached out to General Novotny, the commander of the vaunted 57th Wing that oversees Nellis Air Force Base and the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range , and he was happy to answer all our questions about the contest, the value of aggressor paint jobs, how he came to use social media in such a unique way, what the life of Nellis’s ‘wing king’ is like and more. His answers provide a unique insight into his demanding leadership position and how being really hands-on with the public in a job that is not always conducive to the free flow of information can be a great thing for all involved. How are the 64th Aggressor Squadron’s paint jobs traditionally chosen? Historically we evaluate other nation’s air force’s aircraft, tactics and techniques for best practices or evolving challenges to our method of employment. Sometimes that includes camouflage, cover and concealment methods too. Long ago, when aerial combat almost always involved visually acquiring the adversary, an enemy aircraft paint scheme could provide an advantage by either delaying detection, i.e. it blended in with the background environment, or it could confuse a pilot by masking its aspect angle or range. As a result, 64th Aggressor paint schemes are normally chosen from realistic adversary paint schemes. The selections depend heavily on inputs from our Russia and China Fighter Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The last update to the 64th Aggressor paint schemes occurred in 2016 when we introduced the Su-35S ‘Splinter’, Su-35S/ Su-34 ‘Shark’ (Dark Grey top/Light Blue bottom), and the Dark Grey J-20 paint schemes. We selected these schemes from adversary platforms that were at or near initial operational capability (IOC). USAF What prompted you to go to Facebook and start a voting contest for the unit’s next adversary scheme? I love this job, and I love what we do at Nellis AFB, so I want to take any opportunity to boast about our fine men and women who do great work for their nation. Social Media gives me a chance to connect directly with the folks who have a similar passion for military aviation. I had a great time running the 48th Fighter Wing Commander Facebook page when I was the Wing Commander at Royal Air Force Lakenheath in England. We had such a rich rapport with our UK hosts who have an energetic aviation community. You might not know it, but I believe Las Vegas is a great military city. The people who live here have been around military and civil aviation since before World War II. The Nellis Gunnery Range and Howard Hughes himself saw the aviation benefits of operating here locally. At our wing meetings, I pitched the idea of going to social media with some ideas for a paint scheme and see if we got any response…the rest is history! Novotny, a fighter pilot with the majority of his time in F-15s, commanded the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath before taking the reins of the sprawling 57th Wing. , USAF How did you organize the contest? Was the response what you expected? I started by gathering some recent open source pictures of new paint patterns and just started shopping them online to my Commander’s Facebook audience. I also solicited ideas with some caveats that they be realistic and relevant. The response was better than I hoped. Lots of unique patterns came to light and I even had part-time artists contact the page and design their own submissions. Some were good, some not so good.

Did you have a personal favorite? The Su-57 “digital shark” won the contest. To be honest, it ran away with the vote. I did like the winning pattern, as did the Aggressors, but I also had my eye on a Su-57 splinter shark that didn’t get many votes.  We were concerned that the contest could go awry, but the fans of the site did a great job and I think they truly wanted a relevant and realistic pattern, as well. 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook page 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook page 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook page The paint scheme is based directly on one that is currently being flown on Russia’s Su-57 fighter. , Russian MoD How is the 64th AGRS taking to this new way of selecting a paint job for one of their F-16C/Ds? The 64th Aggressors are very excited about the new Su-57 ‘Digital Shark’ paint scheme. Any opportunity to better replicate adversary fighters is welcomed as it affords our professional aggressors another tool to train warfighters to win in combat. You are an accomplished fighter pilot with time in many types of aircraft, but you spent the most time in F-15s. Since you have plenty of first-hand knowledge, do these paint jobs really make a difference in air combat training? What purpose do they serve beyond looking awesome? Yes, the aggressor paint schemes serve a purpose other than just looking cool. In the book Red Eagles: America’s Secret MiGs , Steve Davies coined the phrase “Buck Fever.” He described Buck Fever as the emotion a new hunter feels the first time they aim a rifle at a deer. The Red Eagle pilots extended this concept to air-to-air combat. ​ ​​​ Maj Francis “Paco” Geisler stated, “The first time I saw a MiG-17, I just stopped flying the airplane.” The Red Eagles believed that exposing pilots to real MiGs in training was the only way to avoid Buck Fever in combat.  Although the 64th Aggressors are not flying actual MiG aircraft, we use adversary paint schemes to help mitigate the risk of Buck Fever. Based on that threat-representative training, our warfighters are much more likely to arrive at a merge, visually identify the enemy, and KILL! I know that when I merge with an Aggressor flying this paint scheme, it will get my attention! Tyler Rogoway/Author When will this new scheme emerge from the paint barn? Will it also be unveiled on your Facebook page? We’re working that right now. We are hoping to have it out before summer. Our plan with our Public Affairs team is to do a time lapse video of the actual work that goes into painting this bird and show all of our fans the fruits of their labor. The rollout will not be quiet! A 64th AGRS Viper undergoing repainting. Each jet is on roughly a six-year cycle to for repainting. You can read all about the process in this past article of ours . , USAF There has been a trend recently in which USAF leadership engages less with the press and the public directly. You are very active on social media and people seem to really love it. What are your thoughts on military leadership embracing outlets like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in a personal and very direct way? I see quite a few folks in the USAF engaging on social media. Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Kaleth Wright is a good friend and he’s very active on social media. My boss General Mike Holmes, Air Combat Command (ACC) Commander is engaged. Former wing commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing Colonel Thomas Palente was great on his site too. I’m not sure it’s a reluctance to engage on social media, more so some folks might be too busy from time to time. We do have to be careful about what we say and how we engage, but I think there can be great value. During Hurricane Michael for example, I know our ACC and Tyndall teammates did well getting the facts to the public. One of the 64th Aggressor Squadron’s most beloved schemes is the ‘splinter’ paint job that was applied a couple of its jets after the 65th Aggressor Squadron, which operated F-15C/Ds and first wore the scheme, was shuttered due to budget cuts in the earlier part of the decade. You can read more about this decision in this previous piece of mine . This particular splinter scheme is inspired by the paint jobs worn by early Su-35 development aircraft. , USAF As the ‘Wing King’ of the vaunted 57th Wing, you seem to be really enjoying your job. You have posted a lot of content showing you going to the small arms range with airmen and flying with various units under your command and some of the many visiting units that use Nellis as a base of operations for unique training. What are your favorite experiences so far? I love being around our young Airmen and watching them do amazing things. I also love everyone’s personal story about why they joined and what they’ve accomplished since putting on the uniform. I think I’m able to connect with folks in the wing and the “truth data” I get because of it is priceless. Couple that with flying a fighter over Las Vegas from time to time…you can’t beat this job. General Novotny at the small arms range with fellow airmen. , USAF How is commanding such a large, diverse, and complex wing different than your past assignments? I find this wing is challenging because of the diversity of the mission set.  We execute Red Flag exercises in the 57th Wing, but our international partners are customers, our allies, our combat units, the headquarters all have vested interests in how Red Flag helps increase readiness. Similarly, the Weapons School produces weapons officers for every single major command, from special operations to mobility to attack and reconnaissance. Finally, the Thunderbirds are the most recognizable organization in the Air Force and the Chief of Staff has a keen interest in what they’re doing to recruit, retain and inspire Airmen.  Because of these factors, the vast diversity and outside impact, I find I spend lots of my time dealing with very senior leaders and multiple other commands. General Novotny flying with a C-130 crew that was visiting Nellis for the unique training environment only it can provide . , 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook page Nellis AFB and the nearby Nevada Test and Training Range are very busy places. What are you looking forward to in 2019? No rest for us – we’ve already started Weapons School Class 19A, Red Flag 19-1 and 19-2 are right around the corner, our AMMOS (Advanced Maintenance and Munitions Operations Schoolhouse} just started a new course, Green Flag West, which is in full swing, all the while our new Thunderbird team is in the middle of the training season with a target to certify in mid-March. Whew! We are working on small changes to Red Flag…we want to get it back to its roots with shorter, more tactically focused Flags designed to increase a unit’s readiness for strike package-type operations. We are building a new course in the Weapons School concentration on high altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. And in July, the Thunderbirds are headed to Colombia, which has not happened for years. In November, we’re hosting Aviation Nation at Nellis…our big open house and airshow. Finally, we are lucky to have great relationships with the Las Vegas community, from the city governments and elected officials, to the businesses downtown, and professional sports teams like the Vegas Golden Knights. We’re even talking with the future Las Vegas Raiders on how we might build a relationship as they move to the area.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",CIA And Skunk Works Secretly Planned To Turn The A-12 Spy Plane Into A Space Launch Mothership,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For decades, there have been reports, which we at The War Zone recently examined in depth , about the possible existence of a U.S. military space vehicle that would hitch a ride on a supersonic mothership aircraft into the upper atmosphere, after which it would blast itself into orbit. There remains only circumstantial evidence that any such combination of aircraft and space vehicle ever came to be, but declassified documents show that there was interest in using the Central Intelligence Agency’s high- and fast-flying A-12 Oxcart spy plane for a very similar satellite-launching role nearly 60 years ago. Lockheed’s Skunk Works, which had developed the A-12, the progenitor of the U.S. Air Force’s SR-71 Blackbird , produced the feasibility study on using the aircraft as a space launch platform in September 1962 . It is unclear whether the CIA or the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the super-secret U.S. intelligence agency primarily responsible for satellite intelligence, requested the report initially, but the CIA paid for it . The very existence of the NRO remained officially classified until 1992. CIA, with input from NRO, released the document in 2002 with some redactions, but placed it in its CIA Records Search Tool ( CREST ) electronic database, which was only accessible via computer terminals at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland at the time. After fighting to maintain this obtuse arrangement for years, a three-year lawsuit finally pushed the Agency to put the documents online in January 2017. A line drawing of a modified A-12 spy plane configured as a space launch platform., Lockheed via CIA “The purpose of this report is to review the technical evaluation concerning the feasibility for utilization of an A-12 vehicle to launch an orbital reconnaissance vehicle over the Soviet land area,” the study’s introduction explains. “As a result of the preliminary evaluation, a configuration is recommended.” The proposed modified A-12 aircraft would carry a satellite and its booster rocket on a set of rails forming a track along the bottom of the aircraft’s fuselage. The single-seat spy plane would also need an additional crew member to help with “navigation, approach [to the launch point], and separation maneuvers.” SR-71s, the successor to the A-12, under construction., CIA The complete payload, a modified Polaris A3 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), another Lockheed product, would be more than 420 inches long and more than 54 inches in diameter. The new mothership would be designated the AP-12, with the “P” likely standing for Polaris. Lockheed’s study focuses almost exclusively on the AP-12 aircraft. A companion report from Lockheed on the air-launched satellite and its booster do not appear to be available through CREST. A separate study on an “air-launched, single-pass, low-orbit reconnaissance system,” which predates the AP-12 report, is available and does provide more detail on three possible payload configurations. CIA also released this document after NRO reviewed its contents. This second document explained that the original requirements for this aerial space launch concept called for a satellite and booster that would be smaller than Polaris. As such, the first configuration was less than 360 inches long and only 40 inches wide. These dimensional stipulations subsequently got relaxed for unspecified reasons to allow the use of a modified version of the SLBM, according to the report. The second configuration was essentially a standard Polaris A3 with a satellite in place of the nuclear warhead. The third and final configuration, which matches the dimensions in the Lockheed AP-12 report, featured an additional third stage to improve performance. Additional proposals from Lockheed included adding tail fins to the end of the booster for added stabilization after release from the mothership, but before the rocket motor actually ignited. The final configuration of the proposed air-launched space vehicle using a modified Polaris A3 design., CIA A proposed version of the air-launched space vehicle with tail fins for added stability., Lockheed via CIA The “low-orbit reconnaissance system” was a small spy satellite that could carry one of three different cameras. Two of these were already in service at the time on the Corona spy satellites . A third stereoscopic panoramic camera design was under development in 1962 when the CIA and NRO were investigating this air-launched concept. A graphic depicting the internal arrangement of the second possible configuration of the satellite which would carry the 24-inch Corona “mural” camera., CIA Lockheed’s design study says that the complete payload design was long enough to extend rearward beyond the main landing gear when loaded onto the AP-12. However, the report adds that ground clearance would not be any more of an issue during takeoff than with a standard A-12. The plane’s landing gear itself would need modifications to accommodate the changes in weight and overall aircraft handing during both takeoff and taxing, though. To further help keep the aircraft stable on the ground and in flight, the AP-12 would only carry half the fuel load of a standard A-12 and the payload would shift rearward along the rails after takeoff to assume an “optimum cruise” position. If a fault were to occur before launch, the crew could still land the plane with the payload locked to the rear. A diagram showing the carriage system for the proposed AP-12, as well as how the payload would shift to the rear once the aircraft was in flight., Lockheed via CIA Lockheed said that it had otherwise determined that the basic A-12 had sufficient power, cooling, and other supporting functions to carry the satellite-tipped Polaris missile. It does say that the mothership aircraft could still require some modifications to the air cycle system the Oxcart used to cool its systems. A backup plan was to use the liquid cooling system Lockheed had developed for the U.S. Air Force’s AF-12 Kedlock high-altitude, high-speed interceptor aircraft, which was derived from the A-12. This aircraft eventually became known as the YF-12A and would have carried a payload of AIM-47 Falcon long-range air-to-air missiles, which could be equipped with nuclear warheads. An early AF-12 Kedlock aircraft., CIA President Lyndon Johnson declassified the existence of YF-12A in 1964, in part to conceal the still-secret A-12. With the Kedlocks flying publicly from Edwards Air Force Base in California, the U.S. government could dismiss any sightings of Oxcarts operating from Groom Lake in neighboring Nevada, better known as Area 51, as people simply seeing the interceptors. The Pentagon finally canceled the Kedlock program entirely in 1968. With regards to the AP-12 mothership, the AF-12/YF-12A would no doubt have otherwise served as a basis for that aircraft, at least in part, given that it was also a two-seat design. As noted earlier, the A-12 and AF-12/YF-12A both led to the development of the Air Force’s two-place SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. Lockheed’s study provides two notional mission profiles, one involving the aircraft cruising back to base at supersonic speeds after launching the satellite and another with the aircraft making the return trip at subsonic speeds. Notional mission profiles for the AP-12., Lockheed via CIA A more detailed graphic showing the exact notional flight profile for an AP-12 supercruising to the launch point., Lockheed via CIA The profile of a mission where the AP-12 would return home at subsonic speed., Lockheed via CIA In both cases, the assumption is that the plane would fly from a base inland in the Contiguous United States more than 2,340 miles to a position east of Hawaii. The two mission profiles also required the mothership to refuel in flight near the base after takeoff to fill its tanks to close to 100 percent capacity, before setting out into the Pacific, where it would refuel again. Once there, the aircraft would conduct a pull-up maneuver while flying at Mach 3.1 at 80,000 feet and release the payload. Five seconds later, the booster rocket would ignite, blasting the satellite into orbit. Afterward, the AP-12 would return to base. From the launch site, the satellite would enter a shallow orbit, passing over South America, the South Atlantic, or Antarctica, before heading up over Africa and the Middle East toward the Soviet Union, according to the separate report on the “low-orbit reconnaissance system.” Depending on the exact mission profile, it might pass over India and the People’s Republic of China, which were also major areas of interest for the United States in the 1960s. A low-quality scan of a map showing possible single orbits for an air-launched satellite. In these missions, the craft would travel east from the Pacific and then re-enter the atmosphere near the Johnson Atoll ., CIA If all went according to plan, a recovery capsule containing the film canister would detach from the rest of the satellite and re-enter the atmosphere over the Pacific to the West of Hawaii. It would automatically deploy parachutes for a safe recovery in mid-air using specialized C-119 Flying Boxcar and C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft, and later or helicopters. The Air Force, together with the CIA and NRO, developed these aircraft and the associated operating concept in the 1950s to grab descending film canisters from more persistent spy satellites. This remained a key method of retrieving imagery and other data from satellites, but became increasingly obsolete as it became more practical for space-based systems to send imagery and other data wirelessly down to ground stations. A diagram showing the recovery capsule that would bring the film back to earth., CIA A JC-130B Hercules practices the maneuver requires to catch falling film and data canisters from US spy satellites near Edwards Air Force Base in 1969., USAF The documents available in CREST do not offer any clear indication of how far the CIA and NRO moved ahead with the AP-12 concept or whether Lockheed actually converted any aircraft. The CIA’s public website on the Oxcart “family” does not mention the AP-12 at all. The potential benefits of an air-launched space-based intelligence gathering system, especially at the time, are obvious. In 1960, the Soviet Union shot down Gary Powers as he flew his U-2 spy plane over their country, sparking an international incident . Afterward, the U.S. government moved almost exclusively to spy satellites to collect imagery and other data about sensitive activities deep within the Soviet Union. However, satellites are relatively rigid tools that are difficult, if not impossible to rapidly reposition on short notice. An air-launched satellite, or reusable space vehicle, offers added flexibility in orbits and can be more readily deployed to respond to new information. It also provides a system that is far less predictable than a satellite moving in a regular orbit, which makes it harder for an opponent to conceal their activities. The AP-12 concept, and those that followed, also require less infrastructure than traditional space launches, have a faster turnaround time for follow-on missions, and cost less. At the time, it could also have preserved A-12’s role in conducting intelligence operations over the Soviet Union without having to put the aircraft themselves at risk. With all this in mind, it is interesting to note that Lockheed’s 1962 design study had also investigated an A-12 configuration with the payload mounted on top of the aircraft. The report describes this arrangement as not only sub-optimal, but also potentially dangerous. A diagram depicting the possible top-mounted configuration for the proposed AP-12 that Lockheed rejected internally., Lockheed via CIA “Asymmetric fuselage loads require a severe structural beefup to support this concept,” the design study explained. “Separation safety is considered much more critical, and additional separation pre-ignition timing degrades performance, compared to the belly launch. The [space launch] vehicle affects upper surface flow and reduces the predictability of the directional stability compared to the underside installation.” This is significant because around the same time Lockheed was working on the AP-12, it was also beginning work on what would become the supersonic D-21 drone , also known by its codename Tagboard. The original plan was for a modified A-12, known as the M-21 , to carry the unmanned aircraft on top and carry it to a designated launch point. This combination was never deployed operationally, though. Test launches in 1966 confirmed the concerns that Lockheed had with the top-mounted AP-12 configuration in spectacular and ultimately deadly ways. An M-21 with the D-21 drone on top of its fuselage., USAF During the very first test launch, the D-21 separated from the M-21, but remained dangerously close to the aircraft before speeding off on its way. In the fourth test flight, the mothership’s crew attempted to launch the drone from a straight and level flight profile with catastrophic results. The unmanned aircraft’s engine suffered a fault and it crashed back into the carrier aircraft, destroying them both. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9u7VnAkWvMY The two pilots ejected, but only the pilot, Bill Park, survived. The Launch Control Officer, Ray Torrick, drowned. In the end, the only operational Tagboard launches occurred using a specially configured B-52 bomber . None of the four missions, all of which occurred over China, were successful and the entire program came to an end in 1971. But, as with the air-launched satellite concept, Tagboard was a product of the post-Gary Powers desire for a more rapidly employable, penetrating long-range intelligence gathering platform that could reach deep into the Soviet Union and Communist China. The drone offered the potential of a lower-risk alternative to direct manned overfights at the time. Other documents that the CIA and NRO have released regarding the status of both spy plane and satellite programs from the same time frame point to still-classified developments that could include an air-launched satellite system. One NRO report from 1963 mentions Oxcart and Tagboard, along with Idealist, the codename for the U-2 . It also includes the codenames Corona , Laynard , and Gambit , which refer to various spy satellites. But a seventh codename remains redacted. The existence of the codenames Isinglass and Rheinberry , which refer to potential A-12 or SR-71 replacements, has long been declassified now, even if many details of those programs remains hidden away. This makes it unlikely that this redacted entry refers to either of those programs. We know that Lockheed continued developing top-mounted launch options for the A-12 family for years after deriding the general idea internally. It is possible that this concept proved to be just as complicated, costly, and disappointing as Tagboard, at least at the time, and the CIA, NRO, and Air Force shifted their attention and resources elsewhere. On the other hand, they could have continued to work on a mothership/space vehicle combination in their preferred configuration. In the end, we don’t have any clear evidence that Lockheed’s concept progressed beyond the drawing board, but there is also much that remains classified about the A-12 and SR-71 programs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 24, 2019",Airwolf Pretty Much Shaped My Life And It Turns 35 Years Old Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For some of us military technology and aviation obsessed souls, it wasn’t Top Gun or Iron Eagle that most influenced us during our formative years, it was a show about a secret super-helicopter that was flown by an emotionally damaged and reclusive veteran helicopter pilot, his few aviation nerd friends, and a mysterious quasi-governmental espionage and intelligence agency known simply as The Firm. Airwolf literally came in hot on January 22nd, 1984, cannons and a synth-heavy soundtrack blazing, capturing imaginations and leaving a select number of us begging for more. The truth is that most people wouldn’t fall in love with the show until it was already deep in production hell towards the end of its run, or even after it was canceled, as reruns aired regularly on the then-popular USA cable network. So TV Guide was essential intel for planning to immerse yourself in the cold, violent, and at times somewhat cheesy, but intriguing world of Airwolf . The show was similar to other hour-long action shows of the era, like the A-Team, Knight Rider, or Magnum PI , in its series format. Each week a new plot would be introduced and concluded, with some overarching themes playing lighter throughout its run. But where Airwolf differed greatly was in its tone. It was an action drama, not an action show laden with comedy, and it was violent in the final sense. People died, lots of them. Bullets didn’t stun the enemy. Major personal loss and deep pain were major plot pieces, and the overall tone of the show was far colder than its counterparts that aimed for a far broader audience. That doesn’t mean it didn’t have its lighter episodes, but those rarely paid off like their counterparts. Jan Michael Vincent as Stringfellow Hawke and Ernest Borgnine as Dominic Santini. , Public Domain Case in point, the main character Stringfellow Hawke, played by then Hollywood hunk Jan Michael Vincent was increasingly loaded on set as the series progressed across its three core seasons. ‘String’ was a recluse that lived in a cabin on a picturesque lake among monumental landforms and was known to bust out his cello to string a heartbreaking dirge on his dock at sunset as bald eagles screamed overhead. Oh, and the source of his sadness? The tragic death of his parents at a young age, the loss of pretty much any women he loved, and above all else, not knowing the fate of his brother, Sinjin, who had gone Missing In Action in Vietnam. So yeah, this is not Templeton Peck or B.A. Baracus we are talking about here. Heavy themes of a government that couldn’t be trusted, one that was often at war with itself and would go to illegal lengths to do what it deemed necessary were also part of the show’s plot fabric. The on-again, off-again semi-ally, The Firm, was run out of a secret ultra-modern office complex at the hands of an eyepatch-wearing man named Archangel who wore all white suits and was driven around in a white limousine by beautiful bodyguards draped in white designer fashions. It was as absurd as it was enthralling. Airwolf Screencaps Then there was the real star of the show, an experimental graphite-colored stealth helicopter called Airwolf officially, but ‘The Lady’ by Hawke and his crew, that was loaded with all kinds of tactical tricks. It had everything, from supersonic dash capabilities via afterburners, to a big selection of weaponry that was otherwise kept concealed when not in use, to the most advanced targeting and reconnaissance capabilities of any helicopter in the world. It was equal parts brawn and brain, with the ability to use guile and information over brute force when needed to accomplish its objectives. Oh, and everyone, and I mean everyone , wanted to steal it. Airwolf Screencap In reality, the aircraft used in the show was a dressed-up Bell 222A, but the thing is Bell’s creation was so futuristic and impressive looking—appearing both muscular and elegant at the same time—that Airwolf didn’t need all that much modification to make it look the part. Watching the show today, it is kinda amazing all the concepts they worked in that seemed totally science fiction then, but are established capabilities today, even the more exotic ones . And back then, available information on sensors and weapons concepts was not what it is today, not even close. Keep in mind, when Airwolf premiered, the AH-64 Apache still hadn’t even entered into operational service. Airwolf Screencaps Some great stunt flying was executed for the show and the snippets were always the highlight of each episode. In fact, when most of us think of Airworlf, an image of a black Bell 222 dumping the nose over while staring straight at us and the sound of the show’s iconic soundtrack is what immediately comes to mind. https://youtube.com/watch?v=A1CjOtSmg6o All these elements, including the great character Domonique Santini, who would now be an AARP icon, played by the late and great Ernest Borgnine, were greater than the sum of their parts. While the overall plot of Airwolf sounds like a someone’s mid-1980s cocaine-addled fever dream, it worked more than it didn’t. And even though it had plenty of cheesy moments and some really uneven acting, just like most shows of the era, it really did take you to another place that not many shows of the time went. One steeped in espionage, secret bases, special operations raids, super weaponry, rogue intel agencies, a thankless government, terrorism, Cold War intrigue, and mercenaries. And yes, aircraft, lots of cool aircraft and exciting flying, all on a relatively minuscule budget by today’s standards. With all this in mind, it’s abundantly clear how this show influenced my interests so heavily growing up. My curiosity in regards to these topics never died and spurred me to write about them in-depth later in life. As such, Airwolf is partially to thank, or to blame depending on your perspective, for this site. And I am not alone. I know many people, from pilots to engineers, who were also really influenced by this show. ​ ​​​ So, although it may just be a stupid short-run action show that is too cheesy to watch now for many, for others it was much more than that or just shallow nostalgia. It was oddly inspirational and left us wanting to know and experience more. In retrospect, that is as a good a measure of success for a TV show than Nielson ratings or good critical reviews.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 3, 2019",This Haunting WWII Photo Sums Up Our Veterans’ Perseverance And Sacrifice,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Veterans Day gives us an opportunity to reflect on just how amazing those who have served our country in uniform are and the critical tasks, both small and large , they have done and continue to do so that we can sleep soundly at night. It’s also a day on which we can focus a bit more on trying to comprehend and reconcile the heroic , but often horrific sacrifices the best of us have made in the defense of our nation. The photo above, one of my favorites from World War II, captures all of this in a single, almost surreal frame. The image depicts services being conducted in the bombed-out and fire-charred hangar bay of the USS Franklin (CV-13). From what I have been able to tell, there are two accounts as to when this photo was taken. Some sources state that the badly damaged aircraft carrier was very close to finally arriving in Brooklyn to begin the process of rebuilding the ship when it was snapped. The war-ravaged Franklin had to travel from the Pacific through the Panama Canal and on to New York to receive repairs because Pearl Harbor and the west coast shipyards were overwhelmed with the construction of new ships and repairs of battle-damaged one. But historic reels state that it was taken shortly after the attack, as soon as the area could be cleared and a remembrance of the those who were lost could be held. Regardless, it is an incredibly moving image that speaks to the sacrifice and dedication of America’s servicepeople. Even after so many were lost and so much was destroyed, the drive to push on with what remains while also remembering those who could not, was a top priority. A badly damaged USS Franklin pulling in to New York in April of 1945. , USN A badly damaged USS Franklin pulling in to New York in April of 1945. , USN The attack on the Essex class carrier USS Franklin (CV-13), also known as “Big Ben,” represents one of the most tragic, but heroic stories of World War II. On Mar. 19, 1945, the ship was operating less than 100 miles off of Japan—closer than any carrier during the war. Within just six hours, her crew were called to battle stations a dozen times . That evening, Captain Leslie Gehres downgraded the alert status for much of the crew, giving them some time to rest. A lone Japanese dive bomber evaded combat air patrols and emerged from the clouds, making an attack run at the ship. It dropped two 550-pound armor-piercing bombs. One stuck dead center on the flight deck. The bomb burrowed into the hangar bay before exploded. The effect was like putting a firecracker in a tin, fuel-laden can. It ripped the carrier apart and sparked a horrific blaze. The other bomb hit towards the rear of the ship, ripping into two decks. When the attack occurred, 31 planes were fully armed on Franklin’s deck, and half as many were fueled and armed in her hangar bay. This set off an unimaginable chain reaction, starting with what amounts to a massive fuel-air burst followed by a crescendo of secondary explosions of ordnance and other combustibles. Aircraft were blasted into each other around the deck like tiny pieces of shrapnel. It was unthinkable mayhem and carnage that began in an instant and lasted over six hours. USS Santa Fe (CL-60) assisting with the firefighting and rescue efforts., USN To get the best idea of what actually happened that day, the videos below tell the story in great detail, but in very different ways. The first is an official vintage reel giving an overview on the attack on Franklin and what came after. If you notice, in it you will see film shot of the service shown in the photo above. The other is an amazing firsthand account from a survivor who was actually there. They work wonderfully together and are a must-watch. In the end, the Navy figured that 724 sailors were killed and hundreds were wounded in the attack and assessments have since elevated that total to potentially over 800 killed and even more wounded. Suffice it to say it was one of the most horrific single incidents of the entire war for the United States. It’s mind-boggling that the crew saved the ship and then sailed it back to the east coast of the United States for repairs. Those who stuck it out were designated by the captain as being part of the “Big Ben 704 Club,” as in 704 crewmen, although the actual number of how many sailors really stuck with the ship remains in question. Regardless, the story of the Franklin attack and the solemn moment in time captured on camera showing the battle-weary crew paying their respects to those they lost among the torn rubble that was their mighty ship’s hangar bay, exemplifies the unique spirit and courageous attitude of those who have served. To all those who were on the Franklin on that terrible day and to anyone who has worn the uniform, thank you.

Chris Harmer,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Veteran Navy Pilot Shares 10 Interesting Things About Flying Seahawk Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The vast majority of helicopters currently operated by the U.S. Navy are either MH-60R or MH-60S variants of the Seahawk airfram e, which is a marinized derivative of the UH-60 Blackhawk . These two variants of the Seahawk replaced three previous H-60 airframes in naval service, the SH-60B, SH-60F, and HH-60H. With thousands of hours at the controls of Seahawk helicopters, here are ten interesting facts and impressions based on my experience about flying these iconic aircraft, some of which you may have never heard before. #1:  The Seahawk is a really fun bird to fly Powered by the GE T700 series of engines, the Seahawk has excellent power margins with extremely rapid transient power response. That’s a convoluted way of saying when you tell the bird to give you more power, it does so quickly. It’s also extremely agile for a helicopter of its size and features an advanced, but user-friendly autopilot system with both barometric and radar altimeter hold functions, which are very useful for long-duration flights at night over water. The first time I flew in an SH-60F, I was amazed at how responsive the aircraft was, but also how stable it was. It was far easier to control than the much smaller TH-57 trainer version of the Bell Jet Ranger I learned on and presented itself as the perfect blend of power, responsiveness, and stability. SH-60F., USN #2: The Seahawk is an extremely safe aircraft Aviators love to fly aircraft at the limits of the performance envelope. It’s exhilarating to see what pilot and machine are capable of when approaching the extremes of human and mechanical performance. With that said, I always felt very safe operating the Seahawk at or near the operational limits of the airframe. One of the reasons the Seahawk was such a safe bird to fly was by the time the Navy started flight testing the SH-60B in 1979, the Army, which had started flight testing the UH-60 in the mid-1970s, had already ironed out most of the serious problems with the airframe. By the time I started flying Seahawks in 1994, virtually every systemic mechanical defect had been identified and fixed. In terms of safety, it was truly a mature airframe. Between 1994 and 2005, I flew just under 3,000 hours in Seahawks. During that time, the only systemic problem that manifested across the Seahawk fleet was a spate of engine rollbacks as a result of the introduction of Digital Electronic Control Units (DECU) for the engines in the mid to late 1990s. An engine rollback is where the Power Control Lever (PCL) is set to full forward, meaning the engine is trimmed to provide full power if required, but in response to a faulty signal from the DECU, the engine abruptly rolls back to an idle power setting. This was a bug of the DECU control system that was quickly identified and fixed, but still hit a number of engines in a relatively short amount of time. USN As originally built, the Seahawk engines were equipped with an Engine Control Unit (ECU) that was purely a hydro mechanical control system. Every pilot input from the cockpit to the engine was transmitted via a contact switch, cable, or some other type of electrical or mechanical linkage to the ECU, which in turn governed the engine via analog mechanical inputs. The physical linkages and governing system were very effective, reliable, and safe, but were not fuel efficient and were maintenance intensive. The replacement of the ECU with the DECU was intended to improve fuel efficiency and overall reliability while reducing maintenance requirements. Eventually this was the case, but when first introduced, a number of DECU equipped engines malfunctioned. I was one of the guys who pulled a short straw and wound up flying a DECU equipped engine that suffered an in flight rollback. It happened just off the coast of Egypt in 1997. I had a full load of internal cargo and passengers, flying into Cairo West in Egypt, a military airport that served as the hub for Operation Bright Star, a semi-annual multinational training event. Two minutes after takeoff, one of the engines suffered a DECU failure and rolled back to flight idle. The other engine had more than enough power for us to keep flying until the carrier could clear the fixed-wing aircraft out of the landing area and give us a clear deck. We executed a bit of a “rolling landing” to minimize the power required for recovery. When all was said and done, the most remarkable aspect of the emergency was how calm it was. That’s the luxury of having robust engines that churn out a lot of excess power when required. Seahawk making its approach to the carrier deck., USN #3: The Seahawk is amazingly adaptable The H-60 is an incredibly versatile airframe and Seahawk pilots have to stay proficient on a wide variety of missions. With the SH-60F optimized for ASW missions and the HH-60H optimized for Special Operations (SPECOPS) support, the training requirements seemed to play out on an endless loop. During 2003, in the space of a few months, I flew missions that included supporting Navy SEALS overland in Iraq, with a four-pack of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles on the port side pylon and a .50 caliber machine gun hanging out the starboard cabin door, standing Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) strip alert, doing search and rescue missions over land and over water, carrying passengers and cargo to and from ship, and dropping torpedoes onto submerged practice targets. There was definitely never a dull day flying Seahawks, as there was always something challenging to train to or do. HH-60H and SH-60F on deck., USN #4: Older Seahawks were not built with night vision in mind Night flying was challenging in the SH-60B and SH-60F because as-built, they were not night vision goggle (NVG) compatible. These two airframes went into production before NVGs were widely available in the fleet, and as a result, the engine instrument panel lights, as well as the warning and caution light panels in the cockpit, were illuminated with amber and red lights instead of NVG friendly blue or green lights. For the readers who haven’t experienced this, early generation NVGs were susceptible to “blooming out” if yellow or red light came into the field of view. Even a small red light source could completely obscure the field of vision on these earlier model NVGs. To remedy this issue, the Navy issued NVG compatible “glare kits” that were essentially tinted glass panels that could be velcroed over the warning and caution light panel at night to make those lights somewhat NVG compatible. Flying formation on NVGs in these airframes was also challenging since the standard navigation lights were installed, and were not NVG compatible. As a workaround to this problem, we attached green chemlights at various points around the airframe. While not optimal, this solution did provide for adequate visual reference to enable safe formation flight at night. In contrast to the SH-60B and SH-60F, the HH-60H was built from the ground up with NVG compatibility in mind. All the instrument displays, as well as the warning and caution lights, were inherently NVG compatible so there was no light blooming in the NVGs. Additionally, the formation lights were NVG compatible as well, which made night formation flying much easier. Seahawk through night vision., USN #5: The Seahawk flew higher than its authorized service ceiling Flying any helicopter at high altitude is an interesting experience, and while the Seahawk has nowhere near the high altitude performance of the CH-47 Chinook , it still can fly a lot higher than the authorized service ceiling of 10,000 feet. Because the H-60 does not have an onboard oxygen system, the Navy limits the maximum altitude to 10,000 feet above sea level as a safety measure, but when flying a lightly loaded Seahawk with no cargo or passengers, and something less than a full load of gas, you can easily get up to 15,000 feet. At that altitude, the helicopter is sluggish and wallows, so you have to be very careful with control inputs. The engines work fine, but the air is not dense enough to give the rotor blades much “bite”. To be clear, I don’t recommend exceeding any operational or safety limit for any reason, but the fact is, almost every Naval Aviator I knew did so on occasion, usually with good reason. A view of an earlier generation Seahawk cockpit. , USN In one instance, we were headed to the Persian Gulf in January of 2003 aboard the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63). One of the civilian contractors on the ship had a heart attack and we needed to immediately get him ashore to a hospital. We flew him into Phuket, Thailand, but the carrier was under orders to proceed at best possible speed. So, after we launched heading north and east into Thailand, the ship continued south and west through the Indian Ocean. We dropped off our medical passenger in Phuket and immediately flew back towards the open ocean, hoping to get in touch with the carrier as soon as possible. The navigation equipment we were using was line-of-sight and at 10,000 feet we were not picking up any signal. The carrier was simply too far away. So, I kept climbing in increments of 500 feet, and eventually, at 14,500 feet we picked up the beacon and rode it home to the carrier, gradually descending all the way. At that altitude, the helicopter was sluggish and slow to respond, but it was still controllable and safe. Given that my ship and squadron were headed off to a potential conflict zone, I felt like I was justified in exceeding altitude limits in order to get the aircraft and crew back aboard. #6: The Seahawk does not hover in a level attitude The normal no wind hover attitude for the SH-60B, SH-60F, and HH-60H was four to five degrees nose up and two to three degrees left wing down. This is slightly disorienting at first. It’s an odd sight picture, so Seahawk pilots quickly learn to incorporate peripheral vision and instrument scan to pick up any drift and establish a steady hover. The glass cockpit of the next generation Seahawk, the MH-60S, as it hovers near USS Theodore Roosevelt’s island superstructure. , USN #7: Flying the H-60 without hydraulic boost is not a pleasurable experience On a regular basis, both in the simulator and the aircraft, we trained to respond to two loss of control emergencies, loss of hydraulic boost and loss of Stability Augmentation System (SAS). In the H-60 control system, the pilot inputs through the cyclic and collective are hydraulically boosted before being applied to the rotating and stationary swashplates at the main rotor head. Some smaller helicopters don’t need any hydraulic boost. Some larger helicopters, like the CH-53 , are impossible to fly without hydraulic boost. But the Seahawk was right in that sweet spot, where it was possible, but very difficult to fly the aircraft without hydraulic boost. Since this was such a difficult emergency to control, we practiced dealing with it on a regular basis. Extended flight with hydraulic boost off was simply impossible. Flying the H-60 in boost off mode, especially in a hover, was physically exhausting. With a starboard crosswind, it took 75 pounds of left pedal force to maintain a directionally stable hover. The key was to establish a semi-stable hover as quickly as possible, then land as fast as you could because the longer you stayed in the hover, the more physically demanding it became. 75 pounds of force isn’t a lot, but the requirement to apply that force never goes away. Reducing that force at all will cause the nose of the aircraft to yaw back to the right. That’s just the requirement to control nose yaw with the left pedal. The cyclic and collective inputs are also unboosted. An MH-60S flaring before touching down on the carrier., USN The Seahawk was an incredibly responsive and agile aircraft, in some ways perhaps too responsive. The SAS function essentially “dampened” both the pilot inputs to the control system and external environmental inputs, like wind gusts. Whenever SAS was engaged, the aircraft was more stable. If the SAS function failed, the aircraft was still flightworthy, it just required that the pilot at controls make virtually continuous control inputs via both directional pedals, the collective, and the cyclic. We often practiced hydraulic boost and SAS failures simultaneously in order to familiarize pilots with how difficult it was to fly under these conditions, and how imperative it was to land as soon as possible. We only practiced this compound, dual emergency in optimal conditions, during daylight, over land, on top of a large, smooth landing area—either a dedicated helicopter landing spot or a smooth grassy field. SH-60F coming in hot., USN #8: The Seahawk cannot refuel in-flight via refueling probe Several land-based variants of the H-60, like the US Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk, have in-flight refueling probes where they can get topped off in flight by a C-130 tanker. This is very useful in terms of mission planning as it provides significant operational flexibility. In contrast, Navy Seahawks do not have inflight refueling capability other than Hover In Flight Refuel (HIFR) , which is mostly used to extend time on station if the ship’s landing area is fouled with cargo. HIFR doesn’t appreciably extend mission range, either. With the recent advent of in-flight refuelable E-2D Hawkeyes , every aircraft in the carrier air wing except the MH-60R and MH-60S are now capable of in-flight refueling. That makes fuel planning the first step of every at sea flight for Seahawks. SH-60F head-on. , USN In the case of the SH-60F, the Navy addressed this at least partially by giving it a massive fuel capacity, with a 590 gallon main tank, 105 gallon permanently installed internal auxiliary tank, and a standard configuration of a single 120 gallon external drop tank, resulting in a total max fuel load of 815 gallons, or approximately 5,500 pounds of gas. In normal ops, we’d burn about 1,000 pounds an hour, so we would regularly operate with a 5.5 hour endurance at takeoff. In lieu of the permanently installed internal auxiliary tank on the SH-60F, the MH-60S is configured to take removable internal auxiliary tanks as required. This makes internal cargo and passenger operations in the MH-60S much more convenient if the internal auxiliary fuel tanks are not installed. Because the MH-60R has such extensive internal mission equipment, it is unable to take internal auxiliary fuel tanks, but has hardpoints and plumbing for two external drop tanks. In any case, running out of gas in a helicopter over land is not nearly as exciting as running out of gas in a helicopter over the ocean, so normal practice at sea was to get gas at every ship we landed on, regardless of our final destination. MH-60R hover in-flight refueling., USN #9: Most the Seahawks have an odd tailwheel placement The SH-60B, SH-60F, and HH-60H had a very odd tailwheel placement, located just aft of the main cabin. The MH-60R was also produced with that tailwheel placement. Shipboard landings, especially on smaller surface combatants , place a significant amount of stress on the airframe. Positioning the tailwheel closer to the rotor head reduces the stress on the tail boom. The MH-60S, however, has its tailwheel located in the same place as the Army and Air Force H-60s, at the far aft end of the airframe. One of the advantages of having a tailwheel located just aft of the main cabin was, it yielded an incredibly tight turning radius, which is very useful for ground crews using tugs to maneuver the helicopter on congested flight decks. Some Naval Aviators are apparently still struggling to master the correspondingly larger radius of turn associated with a long tailwheel placement. MH-60S with its traditional Blackhawk tailwheel seen during vertical replenishment operations., USN #10: Seahawk has become a jack of all trades, but one, at least yet While the H-60 is now the one size fits all solution to every Navy helicopter mission except airborne minesweeping, which is still the sole purview of the relatively small and chronically overtasked MH-53 fleet , it didn’t start out that way. The first H-60 variant the Navy procured was the SH-60B, which replaced the SH-2 Seasprite as the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter operating off of US Navy surface combatants in the Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) role. It was several years later, in the mid-1980s, that the Navy started investigating replacements for the carrier-based SH-3 Sea King fleet. Eventually, the SH-60F was selected as the ASW helicopter operating off of carriers and was procured en masse starting in the late 1980s. The SH-60F and the venerable Sea King it replaced. , USN The SH-60B was designed as an over the horizon extension of the surface ship’s surveillance sensors. The primary sensor it carried was a surface search radar. Operating at altitudes up to 10,000 feet, the SH-60B could surveil thousands of square miles of the ocean’s surface and instantly transmit that data back to the surface ship. In contrast, the SH-60F was designed to provide inner zone defense against submarines for the carrier and was equipped with a powerful dipping sonar that could track submarines and provide targeting data for air or surface-launched torpedoes. Both versions of the Seahawk also carried expendable sonobuoys, which detect and track submarines by passive and active sonar sensors. After the early success of the SH-60B and SH-60F Seahawks, the Navy expanded the model even further by procuring the HH-60H for Naval Special Warfare (NSW) support starting in the early 1990s. By the mid-1990s the Navy decided to divest itself of all legacy rotary wing airframes, including the UH-1 Huey, the SH-2 Seasprite, the SH-3 Sea King, and the CH-46 Sea Knight. SH-60B., USN As far as the next generation of Seahawks, the MH-60R is equipped with cutting edge surveillance and data transmission capability. Even though the MH-60R is based on an airframe design that is quickly approaching the half-century mark in age, its mission equipment is brand new, making it the most technologically advanced Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) helicopter in the world today. It is equipped with a dizzying array of advanced sensors and weapons that enable it to search, locate, track, and engage targets above and below the sea surface. Like its SH-60B predecessor, everything the MH-60R detects is immediately transmitted back to the ship via the Common Data Link (CDL) Hawklink. That data is collected by a variety of sensors including the AAS-44 Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), the APS-147 multi-mode radar with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging and periscope detection modes, the AQS-22 Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS) , and the ALQ-210 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) system for passive detection, location ,and identification of RF emitters. In addition to the onboard sensors, the MH-60R can also carry expendable sonobuoys for detecting and tracking submarines. Finally, in addition to all the sensors, the MH-60 packs a powerful punch with the ability to carry lightweight torpedoes , Hellfire missiles , and door-mounted machine guns. MH-60R “Romeos” in formation., Sikorsky In contrast to the ASW and ASuW mission of the MH-60R, the MH-60S is essentially a flying truck, with the ability to carry cargo both internally or externally via sling load . With a secondary mission of Search and Rescue (SAR), the MH-60S has plenty of internal room to carry rescue swimmers and medical personnel. In a design nod to supporting special operations, the MH-60S was built with the same dedicated door gunner window stations that the Army H-60 Blackhawks have, so the cargo doors on both sides can be used to onload and offload personnel at the same time door gunners are laying down suppressing fire via the window stations. Overall, the MH-60S has much less advanced equipment than the MH-60R, but it does have one very unique and highly advanced piece of equipment, the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS). Along with its logistic and SAR roles, the MH-60S was also originally intended to replace the MH-53 Sea Dragon in its role as an airborne minesweeper, pulling a sled that detected, disabled, or detonated mines. Unfortunately, the minesweeping equipment that the MH-53 operated with ease was just too big for the MH-60S and other towed solutions have not panned out, so instead of using towed equipment, the MH-60S uses the ALMDS to perform the mine detection part of the mission. ALMDS fitted on an MH-60S., USN It’s been 40 years since the Navy made the first test flight of an SH-60B in 1979 and the Seahawk remains a great aircraft to this day. With the fleet full of new build advanced MH-60R and MH-60S types, it will be around for at least another 20 years, and probably much longer.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The Navy’s Secretive And Revolutionary Program To Project False Fleets From Drone Swarms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has been quietly developing what could be one of the most important, transformative, and fascinating advances in naval combat, and warfare in general, in years. This new electronic warfare “system of systems” has been clandestinely refined over the last five years and judging from the Navy’s own budgetary documents, it may be operational soon, if it isn’t already. This secretive new electronic warfare “ecosystem” is known as Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS. NEMESIS is not just some ‘paper program.’ From publicly available, but obscure documents we’ve collected, it’s clear that, for years, the Navy has been developing and integrating multiple types of unmanned vehicles, shipboard and submarine systems, countermeasures and electronic warfare payloads, and communication technologies to give it the ability to project what is, in essence, phantom fleets of aircraft, ships, and submarines. These realistic-looking false signatures and decoys have the ability to appear seamlessly across disparate and geographically separated enemy sensor systems located both above and below the ocean’s surface. As a result, this networked and cooperative electronic warfare concept brings an unprecedented level of guileful fidelity to the fight. It’s not just about disrupting the enemy’s capabilities or confusing them at a command and control level, but also about making their sensors tell them the same falsehoods across large swathes of the battlespace. Another way of looking at it is NEMESIS shifts from traditional electronic warfare tactics, in which multiple electronic warfare systems execute individual electronic attacks on multiple enemy sensors to achieve largely individual or localized effects, to a very diverse set of networked electronic warfare systems cooperatively making electronic attacks on huge portions of an enemy’s sensor network. That network may stretch across large distances and multiple warfighting domains. In doing so, it achieves a cohesive set of far more unified, powerful, and convincing effects. It sounds like science fiction, but it is anything but—it’s the next quantum leap in the quiet, but ferocious struggle to control the invisible domain of electronic warfare. The Invisible War Electronic warfare (EW) has become an essential part of military strategy over the better part of the last century. This has only become more pronounced in recent decades as military systems have increasingly migrated into the digital age. NATO’s simplest definition of electronic warfare is as follows: The purpose of EW is to deny the opponent the advantage of, and ensure friendly unimpeded access to the electromagnetic spectrum. EW can be applied from air, sea, land, and space, and target communication and radar systems. It involves the use of electromagnetic energy to provide improved understanding of the operational environment as well as to achieve specific effects on the modern battlefield. Electronic warfare encompasses a huge variety of operations and tactics, such as disrupting enemy communications and preventing your own from being disrupted. Maybe the most well-known form of EW has to do with jamming enemy radar systems, but there are many forms of electronic warfare that don’t involve traditional jamming. These include detecting, spoofing, and distracting enemy sensor systems and denying them the opportunity to successfully target friendly forces to varying degrees. Cyberwarfare tactics and the ability to actually disrupt enemy sensors, networks, and command and control systems at the software level are a highly critical emerging realm of warfare that in some cases can cross over and become blended with electronic warfare tactics. Even the use of directed energy weapons can be part of a force’s electronic warfare bag of tricks. Although it is the least visible component of a present-day military’s order of battle and overall capabilities, and much of the details of exactly what capabilities exist and how they are realized remains in the shadows, electronic warfare is becoming one of the most important facets of modern warfare . As a result, future combat will occur just as much in this invisible spectrum as the visible one. The Cold War Gave Birth To Modern Electronic Warfare Electronic warfare, as we understand it today, is not new. The U.S. military has been deploying EW technologies that go beyond simple jamming since at least the mid-20th Century. Stealth technology would never have been so successful without electronic warfare backstopping it during combat operations. In fact, the only engagement in which an F-117 was ever shot down occurred on the only night of the aircraft’s use during Operation Allied Force when electronic warfare support was not available. EW, at least how we understand it in modern, advanced terms, dates back much farther, to the height of the Cold War when the CIA launched the PALLADIUM project, which deployed radar spoofing systems and submarine-launched balloons carrying metallic radar reflectors in order to stimulate and probe Cuba’s Soviet-made air defenses. The effort was part of a grander objective to understand how vulnerable the A-12 Oxcart —the CIA’s progenitor of the SR-71 Blackbird and the first aircraft to integrate stealthy attributes as a driving factor in its design —would be to enemy air defenses. You can read all about this fascinating bit of history in this past piece of ours. An A-12 Oxcart., Lockheed Martin Considering that the CIA possessed the capability 65 years ago to clandestinely launch airborne radar reflectors from submarines and combine them with electronic warfare capabilities that could simulate or spoof the presence of American fighter aircraft on the most advanced Soviet radar systems of the era, it isn’t hard to use one’s imagination to ponder what is possible today. We know that EW capabilities have evolved drastically in step with advances in sensor, emitter, and computer processing technologies and the increasingly potent data networks that integrate and fuse their capabilities with other systems and platforms. NEMESIS is the next evolutionary leap in this regard, and a particularly huge one at that. Electrons Not Bombs The U.S. Navy’s leadership has stated repeatedly that developing a major leap in EW capabilities has been a vital area of research over the last decade. On Oct. 29, 2013, then-Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Jonathan Greenert, the service’s top officer, said as much when he spoke at a convention of the Association of Old Crows (AOC) . At the conference, Greenert told attendees that the Navy was looking for ways to move away from traditional weaponry and turn instead more heavily towards electronic warfare and information warfare . “We’ve got to evolve this paradigm,” he said, adding that electronic warfare could essentially replace kinetic warfare in many situations: “We’re using the electromagnetic spectrum as a domain and as a means, and we understand and grasp it. We have to figure out how we can beat things electronically first. Why do we spend all this money kinetically if we can jam, spoof, or do otherwise? We need to prepare the fleet to enact an electronic warfare plan the same way they think of a communications or surface warfare plan.” In 2015, the National Interest published an op-ed titled “Winning the Airwaves: Sustaining America’s Advantage in the Electromagnetic Spectrum,” in which authors Bryan Clark and Mark Gunzinger wrote that America had failed to maintain its electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) superiority since the end of the Cold War. This failure had allowed “China, Russia and other rivals with an opportunity to field systems that target vulnerabilities in sensor and communication networks the U.S. military has come to depend on. As a result, America’s once significant military advantage in the EMS is eroding, and may in fact no longer exist,” they said. The same authors produced a 2015 white paper for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) think tank detailing how America could regain EMS superiority , writing that the Department of Defense “now has the opportunity to develop new operational concepts and technologies that will allow it to ‘leap ahead’ of its competitors and create enduring advantages in EMS warfare.” The document lists NEMESIS as one such technology, but does not disclose any further details about the program. Two years earlier, however, budget documents show that the Navy was beginning to develop a highly integrated constellation of next-generation systems for spoofing or fooling distributed sensors and the platforms that host them. NEMESIS Genesis An electronic warfare development program known as Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors or “NEMESIS” first emerged in Navy Research, Development, Test & Evaluation Budget Item Justification documents in the service’s budget proposal for the 2014 Fiscal Year, which it published in April 2013. In that and subsequent budget requests, NEMSIS appeared under the program elements “PE 0602271N / Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research” and “PE 0603271N / Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology.” In these budget documents, the Navy describes NEMESIS as a “System of Systems (SoS) able to coordinate distributed EW resources against many adversary surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously” which “will benefit the warfighter by providing platform protection across the battlespace against many sensors, creating seamless cross-domain countermeasure coordination, and enabling rapid advanced technology/capability insertion to counter emerging threats.” More specifically, the Fiscal Year 2014 Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research RDT&E Budget Item Justification states that NEMESIS “addresses the need to generate the appearance of a realistic naval force to multiple adversarial surveillance and targeting sensors simultaneously.” DoD Later in that same document, a more detailed description of the program states that NEMESIS consists of “reconfigurable and modular EW payloads, Distributed Decoy and Jammer Swarms (DDJS), effective acoustic countermeasures (CM), and Multiple Input/Multiple Output Sensor/CM (MIMO S/CM) for false force generation to both above and below water sensors.” The 2018 and 2019 budget justifications state that “Nemesis expendable decoys and prototype system hardware will be completed and delivered for field testing” and that demonstrations of these expendable decoys “will be conducted during fleet experimentation, as well as during focused field and laboratory tests.” DoD A Shadowy NEMESIS There is little publicly available information surrounding NEMESIS aside from these unclassified budgetary documents and a few publications and presentations that mention the program, usually to a very limited degree. Many specifics about the NEMESIS system remain unknown, but the documents help add context to the budget line item justifications we’ve presented above. On April 9, 2014, Bob Smith, Director of Disruptive Technologies at the Office of Naval Research (ONR) gave a presentation at the National Defense Industrial Association’s 15th Annual Science and Engineering Technology Conference that described several innovative Navy prototype research programs, or INPs. A slide from the presentation offered a basic, but absolutely impressive overview of the NEMESIS program while of course stating “Additional details classified.” ONR The presentation stated that NEMESIS worked against distributed sensor systems in order to confuse or spoof an enemy force’s surveillance and targeting systems. That document also said that the NEMESIS system “enables rapid advanced technology/capability insertion for emerging threats”, meaning that NEMESIS could be quickly modified and upgraded to counter the latest capabilities that are still under development. At the time, ONR said that NEMESIS addressed current limitations of traditional EW systems and multiple items on the United States Pacific Command (PACOM) Integrated Priority List (IPL), a list of the Pacific Command’s highest priorities for ensuring its forces are capable of accomplishing their missions. According to the same ONR presentation, NEMESIS consisted of “modular and reconfigurable EW payloads” including “decoy and unmanned air and surface platforms” based on the ONR’s Science & Technology and Future Naval Capabilities programs. NEMESIS combined functionality and capabilities from Code 31 : Information, Cyber and Spectrum Superiority; Code 33 : Mission Capable, Persistent and Survivable Naval Platforms; and Code 35 : Aviation, Force Projection and Integrated Defense. Shortly after that ONR presentation, the publicly available 2015 Navy Program Guide offered a definition of NEMESIS in its appendix, stating that NEMESIS could “synchronize electronic warfare (EW) affects across a variety of distributed platforms to create coherent and consistent EW effects” and that “NEMESIS emphasis is on the coordination and synchronization of EW capabilities and tactics against sensors in many scenarios.” That same guide also stated that development of NEMESIS began in 2014 and was an interdisciplinary project involving well-known research centers, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and ONR: In 2013 the Navy approved NEMESIS as a FY 2014 INP New Start. Initial NEMESIS activity involved planning discussions among the Office of Naval Research, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, fleet commands and analysts, acquisition programs of record, government laboratories and warfare centers, the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency, and federally funded research and development centers and university affiliated research centers. To ensure NEMESIS is addressing current and future threats to naval battle group operations, threat assessments were initiated with the Intelligence Community, and a Navy Warfare Development Command NEMESIS war game will be conducted in 2015. Navy.mil On Feb. 4, 2015, Dr. Thomas Killion, then-Director of Technology at the Office of Naval Research, gave a presentation at the ONR Naval Future Force Science and Technology Expo. In that presentation, NEMESIS is listed as a current Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) program alongside some of the Navy’s most important leading-edge weapons development initiatives, including the Electromagnetic Railgun , the Large Displacement Unmanned Underwater Vehicle , the Integrated Topside information operations and communications suite, and the Autonomous Aerial Cargo Unmanned System . ONR The Navy’s 2015 Program Guide also mentions that the Navy conducted a war game in 2015 to test the NEMESIS system. Another budget document, the 2017 RDT&E Project Justification document for the Navy’s “Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Architecture/Engineering Support” program, states that this war game took place in late February 2015: NEMESIS War Game : This Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored war game was conducted by NWDC and completed 23-26 Feb 2015. The primary purpose of the war game was to obtain fleet stakeholder input into the requirements for and design of a classified ONR Innovative Naval Prototype. The results of this effort will be used to design prototypes that could eventually be fielded as a Navy program of record. That document also states that the NEMESIS war game which took place in 2015 “consisted of multiple events designed to explore innovative concepts and technologies associated with EMW”, or electromagnetic warfare, and “obtain fleet stakeholder input into the requirements for and design of a classified ONR Innovative Naval Prototype.” The descriptions of this war game appear to describe a seminar or “tabletop” exercise designed to formulate initial ideas for developing such a system, but exact details of the war game remain unknown. The 2017 Navy Program Guide states that dedicated hardware for NEMESIS was developed in 2016 and that NEMESIS was expected to be demonstrated at full capability in late 2018: NEMESIS has been in development since 2014, including close collaboration with the Office of Naval Research, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, fleet commands and analysts, acquisition programs of record, government laboratories and warfare centers, the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency, and federally funded research and development centers and university-affiliated research centers. During 2016, NEMESIS capabilities began hardware development, technique and software migration and field testing at the sub-system level. In FY 2017-2018 flight and at-sea testing will be conducted on integrated system level capabilities in preparation for graduation demonstrations in late FY 2018. The guide goes on to list the NEMESIS system’s developers: Georgia Tech Research Institute, Johns Hopkins’ Applied Physics Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Lincoln Lab, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Office of Naval Research, and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. The Navy just recently rebranded Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command as the Naval Information Warfare Systems Command. Navy.mil EW Swarms While the exact components of the NEMESIS system remain unknown, there are some hints about what types of decoys and swarms could make up such a system. In a 2017 Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) white paper titled “ Winning in the Gray Zone : Using Electromagnetic Warfare to Regain Escalation Dominance,” authors Bryan Clark, Mark Gunzinger, and Jesse Sloman described the various elements that made up EW ecosystems then in development, such as NEMESIS and DARPA’s System of System Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE). The document described swarms of expendable unmanned aerial systems that “incorporate cognitive processing and coordinate their actions through communication networks,” meaning they can share data in real-time and operate semi-autonomously to jam an adversary’s sensors, act as or release decoys, gather targeting information, and detect and map air defense networks. A DARPA SoSITE concept graphic of networked expendables, showing what appear to be small unmanned systems similar to the Nomad rotor-propelled drone , larger unmanned combat air vehicles reminiscent of the Northrop Grumman X-47B , and another unknown small UAV flying in concert with an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and an E-2 Hawkeye ., DARPA/CSBA Launching waves of these UAVs could extend U.S. forces’ sensor networks, confuse or obscure enemy defenses, provide a resilient communications network, coordinate and assign targets for weapons salvos, and even “provide targets to hypersonic weapons that have a very short time-of-flight,” the paper explained. Aside from providing fire and communications support, the NEMESIS system was said to be capable of creating viable false targets that would “increase the number of potential targets” an adversary would have to engage. These false targets would “mimic the RF emissions and radar returns of real platforms” and include infrared decoys and “concepts and capabilities to simulate the computer network activity of deployed forces.” The NEMESIS system even included underwater “high-fidelity acoustic decoys” which can generate “additional targets for the enemy to investigate or attack,” according to the CSBA white paper. These acoustic decoys could include radio emulators and simulate propeller noise or other propulsion systems, as well as specific equipment on surface ships and submarines. The CSBA said these decoys could increase the size of the forces or amount of munitions an enemy force would have to respond with, ideally making that adversary less willing to risk a larger use of its assets. What that means is that this EW system can not only disrupt an adversary’s tactics, but to some extent also dictate his battlefield decision-making. The CSBA report described how these effects could be achieved using small unmanned EW systems launched from either high altitude balloons or undersea platforms, such as submarines or unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) to create these electronic warfare effects: Launching EMW expendables at higher altitudes is another approach to extending their ranges and endurance. Launching small EMW UAVs, missiles, or munitions from very high altitude (60,000 to 120,000 feet) balloons could be a less expensive option than using a missile. High altitude balloon technologies are very mature and may cost significantly less than other delivery methods. Furthermore, defeating balloon-delivered EMW expendables would likely require SAMs that can reach very high altitudes. Using these expensive SAMs to defeat large numbers of balloons—some which might be decoys—could be costly and operationally impractical for aggressors. Another innovative delivery method for EMW expendables could be from undersea platforms, which may be the best use of undersea payload capacity in general. […] Undersea platforms could be one of the most effective methods to deliver EMW expendables because they can closely approach enemy coastlines and targets. This allows shorter-range expendables to be employed, which are less expensive, smaller, and can be carried in higher numbers than larger payloads like cruise missiles. Numerous sea and submarine-launched UAVs and autonomous swarm systems have already been developed or are in development. Small drone swarms can also be launched from virtually any type of ship and from shore, and even aircraft, as well. In fact, the Navy already has a swarming electronic warfare capability in the form of the ever-evolving Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) . But pairing various platforms, from radar reflector and electronic warfare payload-carrying balloons and swarms of drones of different sizes and performance capabilities, and networking them together to work cooperatively to confuse, spoof, and/or blind enemy sensors dispersed over a wide area is clearly what this system is all about. The Office of Naval Research has been testing a small, low-cost rotary-wing drone known as Nomad , described as “a highly affordable expendable design” that can be deployed without the need to ensure it returns to its parent vessel. The Nomad can be launched from tubes using a CO2 ejection system that can fit on a variety of platforms and tests of this compact UAV have found that “multiple Nomads can safely operate in the same airspace and fly in a coordinated fashion.” Nomad undergoing testing., USN One of the only non-Navy mentions of the NEMESIS program found online is in a NavalDrones.com article from 2017, which describes the Nomad specifically as being part of the NEMESIS system. While that claim is unconfirmed on an official level, the Naval Research Laboratory has publicly disclosed tests of the Nomad system without mentioning NEMESIS. Still, given that many of the NEMESIS documents state that “Distributed Decoy and Jammer Swarms (DDJS)” are an integral part of the system, it’s possible, if not probable, that Nomad and swarms of other small drones are part of this highly sophisticated and networked electronic warfare capability. The 2017 CSBA paper also cites a wide range of other unmanned systems that could hypothetically be integrated into the NEMESIS system, although it remains unknown which specific expendables are used: Small expendables in development or use today include the Switchblade precision missile, which is in use with Special Operations Forces; small UAVs such as the Coyote UAV, used in the Navy’s Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) program; and loitering munitions like the Lockheed Martin Fire Shadow. Expendables have also been integrated with launch platforms. The Navy is developing a submarine-launched version of the Blackwing UAV, which is similar to the Switchblade. Furthermore, the U.S. Air Force has deployed the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) since the 1990s. The aforementioned LOCUST would be one of the most obvious platforms to execute major parts of the NEMESIS concept. The Navy has been experimenting with this highly deployable swarming drone capability for years and the airframes are highly adaptable and can be launched from almost anywhere. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo Lockheed Martin has been also developing small unmanned aerial vehicles such as the tiny Outrider micro-aircraft , which can be launched from canisters that fit inside submarine missile tubes. The Naval Research Laboratory has tested all-electric folding wing drones designed to launch from torpedo tubes using existing launch systems. Glimpses of other similar systems in development have been offered over the last few years, including ones designed to carry infrared and electro-optical payloads . Northrop Grumman has tested electronic warfare drones dropped from EA-18G Growlers inside canister deployment systems and air-launched electronic warfare enabled swarming munitions are set to become a major staple of aerial warfare. Earlier this year, the Office of Naval Research issued a special notice for a research opportunity to develop a “Long Endurance Advanced Off-board Electronic Warfare Platform,” or LEAP. This program was listed under two of the same codes as NEMESIS, ONR Code 35: Aerodynamics, Autonomy, Flight Dynamics & Control, as well as Code 31: Electronic Warfare. The proposed vehicle design to be researched was for a ship-launched, long-range expendable decoy that can carry modular EW payloads. Swarms of small unmanned surface vessels and even undersea vessels seem to fulfill aspects of NEMESIS’ cross-domain capability as well. But leveraging swarms of smaller and somewhat expendable aerial drones and munitions that can work in conjunction with larger, less numerous, and more advanced platforms allows the NEMESIS concept to cover large geographical areas associated with modern naval combat and to distribute EW capabilities in a more resilient and decentralized manner than in the past. In doing so, it also allows for these swarms and the various dissimilar nodes that can make up the NEMESIS system at any given time to create fleets of ships and aircraft that aren’t really there across a huge area as well as execute more mundane tasks, such as jamming individual enemy emitters or working as sacrificial decoys for enemy weapons themselves. All of this could, and eventually will, also be networked with existing, more traditional electronic warfare systems such as those mounted on the Navy’s surface combatants. In particular, this could be networked with the SLQ-32 SEWIP and the new and shadowy SLQ-59 that has recently arrived on some of the Navy’s vessels. The Navy’s EA-18G Growler could also act as a major component in this EW ecosystem and as a forward command and control node. It’s also worth remembering that NEMESIS, or at least parts of it, would also be an incredible and obvious intelligence collecting tool when it comes to probing and evaluating an enemy’s defenses and recording its electronic order of battle. This could be done even in peacetime, very much in the same vein of PALLADIUM so many years ago, but on a much larger and more elaborate scale. Evolution Of A Revolution In Fiscal Year 2015, the NEMESIS program expanded beyond the Navy’s PE 0602271N / Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research program and began appearing in the budget line justification documents of several additional programs in subsequent fiscal years. During the next fiscal cycle, the Navy’s Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research program continued to work on NEMESIS as it had in prior years. Then, in Fiscal Year 2017, the program’s budget increased significantly “due to hardware procurement and conducting field experiments of NEMESIS technologies.” DoD The Fiscal Year 2017 RDT&E Project Justification for the NEMESIS work conducted by Navy program PE 0603271N / Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology states that Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018 are dedicated to “the integration and demonstration of these new technologies”. DoD In Fiscal Year 2018, NEMESIS appeared on two new Navy research program elements titled “PE 0602792N / (U)Innovative Naval Prototypes(INP) Applied Research” and “PE 0603801N / (U) Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Advanced Technology Development.” Those programs’ goals for that fiscal cycle, respectively, were: PE 0602792N / (U)Innovative Naval Prototypes(INP) Applied Research : Complete the Nemesis project by finishing research efforts to develop and mature technologies in multiple areas that will be used to assess the feasibility of Nemesis to coordinate Electronic Warfare (EW) operations across distributed EW systems. Technologies being matured include swarming vehicle operations, distributed resource mission control, multi-domain coordinated operations and advanced RF component and subsystems technologies. These emerging technologies are being designed and developed for prototype Nemesis systems which will be capable of performing coordinated EW operations across distributed EW systems. PE 0603801N / (U) Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Advanced Technology Development : Complete the Nemesis project, previously funded in 0603271N Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology Development, by designing and building prototype Nemesis payloads that implement industry standards for software, hardware, and firmware interfaces. Nemesis expendable decoys and prototype system hardware will be completed and delivered for field testing. Demonstrations of Nemesis platforms and payload will be conducted during fleet experimentation, as well as during focused field and laboratory tests. These budgetary documents state that the Innovative Naval Prototype programs “represent game-changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts. They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight. INPs push the imagination of our nation’s technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities.” DoD In Fiscal Year 2019, funding continued to decrease in both the PE 0603271N / Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology and PE 0602271N / Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research programs due to the fact that the NEMESIS program was now being developed under the Innovative Naval Prototypes programs, suggesting it has advanced beyond research and development and is now working towards an operational state. Electronic Warfare: The Next Generation The very existence of NEMESIS proves that a revolution in electronic warfare is well underway. If the capabilities we’ve described can be gleaned from scant publicly available information, there are no doubts that more advanced NEMESIS components and capabilities remain classified. It is also likely that some components of the system have existed long before they began to be integrated with other platforms under the NEMESIS program. Above all else, that is what NEMESIS does: it pulls together various leading-edge EW concepts and networks them together for a combined electronic warfare fight the likes of which we have never seen before. As more nations develop and refine their advanced integrated sensor networks, next-generation EW “systems of systems” such as NEMESIS will become more vital to protecting the U.S. and allied assets and for giving them a leg up by being able to directly manipulate what the enemy believes is occurring on the battlespace based on their own sensors’ data. As such, NEMESIS can help level the playing field against increasingly capable sensor networks, whether by blinding certain parts of those networks while spoofing others or by having the enemy fire its treasured weaponry at ghosts in the sea and in the air. Even a formation of what appears to be an incoming bomber force on radar and a puzzling group of bright signatures on infrared sensors could draw the enemy’s attention away from critical parts on a real offensive. Yes, much of this sounds almost like magic, and it is probably the closest thing the military has to it, but going by even the limited information we were able to uncover about NEMESIS, it really does represent the evolutionary next great leap in electronic warfare—one that will elevate this murky art from a supporting aspect of military operations to a primary offensive and defensive one.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 20, 2019",The Truth Is The Military Has Been Researching “Anti-Gravity” For Nearly 70 Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Decades-old questions about the potential existence of fantastical anti-gravity propulsion technologies have resurfaced following the Navy’s own disclosure of encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena and our own original reporting on a series of bizarre patents assigned to the U.S. Navy that seem to defy our current understanding of physics and aerospace propulsion . While the discussion continues over whether any such technologies are feasible, the truth is that the theoretical concepts behind them are anything but new. In fact, the U.S. military and the federal government have been formally researching these radical concepts since the 1950s, and according to our own research, those efforts have continued on to this very day. In our dive into what seems like something of a bottomless rabbit hole of government studies into this exotic scientific realm, we have collected a body of research, news reports, and firsthand accounts. These establish the fact that the types of “anti-gravity”, propellantless propulsion, and mass reduction technologies described in the Navy’s recent “UFO” patents are at least based on more than 60 years of peer-reviewed research conducted and published by the likes of the American Institute of Physics, NASA, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Air Force Research Laboratory. While we can’t say that any of this research led to actually being able to harness “anti-gravity” or extremely advanced next-generation propulsion technologies to any useful extent, the most advanced laboratories under control of both the armed forces and the academic world have certainly been trying their best to get there for the better part of a century. Also, keep in mind that all of this information comes from unclassified sources, and there is definitely more of it than just what is represented here. We can only wonder how much work has been done in the classified realm on what was once openly considered the next massive revolution in aerospace technology. The Martin Company’s Early Foray Into Anti-Gravity In terms of the Air Force’s early anti-gravity research, one intriguing first-hand account comes from Dr. Louis Witten, who was a professor of physics at the University of Cincinnati from 1968 to 1991. Throughout his career, Witten conducted research into gravitation, quantum gravity, and general relativity. The last one of these is the theory first put forward by Albert Einstein that proposes that gravity is essentially a warp or curve in the geometry of space-time caused by mass. During a roundtable discussion titled “Recollections of the Relativistic Astrophysics Revolution” held at the 27th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics in 2013, Witten recounted his own work on what he somewhat puzzlingly refers to as “the discovery of anti-gravity.” In his portion of the roundtable, Witten recalls being recruited by George S. Trimble, then serving as Vice President for Aviation and Advanced Propulsion Systems at the Glenn L. Martin Company, which evolved first into Martin-Marietta and eventually merged with Lockheed in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin. The project for which Witten was recruited would come to be known as the Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS) and was officially founded in 1955 by George Bunker, president of Martin, with the goal of advancing aerospace science and development. “The vice president [Trimble] had the wonderful idea which was to develop anti-gravity,” Witten says, noting he immediately balked at the proposal. “When he tried the idea in public, you can imagine the greeting he received from scientists. So he said to himself ‘those poor bastards, I’ll show them.'” Despite his skepticism, Witten ended up accepting Trimble’s offer to join the powerful Martin executive’s pet project. Throughout his short speech given at the roundtable , Witten says that even though he faced ridicule within the scientific community for his research, there was no shortage of people who would tell him they knew how to achieve anti-gravity: “Some of them were very simple ideas. The simple ideas are always hard to combat. Suppose somebody comes to you and says ‘I have a rock of bismuth that demonstrates anti-gravity.’ What do you do? There was a Vice President of the Martin Company who brought that up, he said ‘I read about a guy in Indiana who says a rock of bismuth…’ I said ‘It’s nonsense.’ He said ‘How do you know it’s nonsense? How do you know there’s no isotope of bismuth that shows anti-gravity?’ What do you say to that?” Witten’s speech begins around the 1:49:10 mark: Witten’s ends his speech by pointing out that despite the constant barrage of nonsense claims to investigate, “the power of a Vice President of a big company is so great that the reason there was a laboratory at Wright Field [today known Areas A and C of Wright Patterson Air Force Base] was to find out what we were doing and to help us do it and I got a contract from Wright Field to do it – to do gravity. Which I did, very happily.” It’s unknown what, if anything, ever came of Witten’s research or the program’s other related research. While we haven’t found a record of him at Wright Patterson to confirm his account, Witten did in fact publish several theoretical articles concerning general relativity throughout that period including “ Invariants of General Relativity and the Classification of Spaces ”, “ Geometry of Gravitation and Electromagnetism ”, and “ Conformal Invariance in Physics ”, all of which list Witten as an employee of the Research Institute for Advanced Studies established by Martin. The anti-gravity work Witten claims to have conducted at RIAS on behalf of Martin is corroborated by a series of three articles written by aviation journalist Ansel Talbert and published in the New York Herald Tribune on November 20, 21, and 22, 1956. Talbert served as the aviation correspondent for the Herald Tribune from 1953 until the paper shut down in 1966, after which he wrote for various aviation magazines and trade publications. The front page of the November 20, 1955 issue of the New York Herald Tribune., New York Herald Tribune The articles outline several research institutes that were focused on unlocking the secrets of gravity in the 1950s, including several major universities and private laboratories. A key part of much of the research conducted at these facilities involved relatively down-to-earth topics like electromagnetism, rotating masses at high speeds, and various methods of attempting to reduce an aircraft’s mass. Ansel Talbert was offered a firsthand glimpse into the research conducted at many of the laboratories set up in the 1950s to research gravity and attempts to combat it. His series of articles exploring the subject mention the anti-gravity interests and research of some of the biggest names in aviation: William P. Lear, Lawrence D. Bell, Dr. Igor I. Sikorsky, Martin’s Vice President Trimble, and even frozen foods magnate Clarence Birdseye. “Mr. Birdseye gave the world its first packaged quick-frozen foods and laid the foundation for today’s frozen food industry,” Talbert wrote, “more recently he has become interested in gravitational studies.” Lawrence Bell of Bell Aircraft with Lt. Col Frank J. Everest, Maj. Charles Yeager, and Maj. Arthur Murray. According to Talbert’s articles, Bell believed that is was possible “to cancel out gravity instead of fighting it.”, New York Herald Tribune Talbert’s series offers a fascinating glimpse into the many anti-gravity research efforts which were underway in the mid-1950s, but like all accounts of anti-gravity or breakthrough propulsion research, none of the subjects Talbert interviewed offered any suggestion that conclusive working anti-gravity technologies ever came from these endeavors. Still, Talbert points out that some of the brightest minds in aerospace engineering and physics were devoted to studying gravity at the time, studies which led to important breakthroughs in general relativity: The current efforts to understand gravity and universal gravitation both at the sub-atomic level and at the level of the universe have the positive backing today of many of America’s outstanding physicists. These include Dr. Edward Teller of the University of California, who received prime credit for developing the hydrogen bomb; Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton; Dr. Freeman J. Dyson, theoretical physicist at the Institute, and Dr. John A. Wheeler, professor of physics at Princeton University who made important contributions to America’s first nuclear fission project. It must be stressed that scientists in this group approach the problem only from the standpoint of pure research. They refuse to predict exactly in what directions the search will lead or whether it will be successful beyond broadening human knowledge generally. One of the biggest takeaways from Talbert’s series is the optimism shared by many of those involved with the project, as well as the stigma surrounding such an endeavor, even back then: Grover Loening, who was the first graduate in aeronautics in an American university and the first engineer hired by the Wright Brothers, holds similar views. Over a period of forty years, Mr. Loening has had a distinguished career as an aircraft designer and builder and recently was decorated by the United States Air Force for his work as a special scientific consultant. “I firmly believe that before long man will acquire the ability to build an electromagnetic contra-gravity mechanism that works,” he says. “Much the same line of reasoning that enabled scientists to split up atomic structures also will enable them to learn the nature of gravitational attraction and ways to counter it.” Right now there is considerable difference of opinion among those working to discover the secret of gravity and universal gravitation as to exactly how long the project will take. George S. Trimble, a brilliant young scientist who is head of the new advanced design division of Martin Aircraft in Baltimore and a member of the sub-committee on high-speed aerodynamics of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, believes that it could be done relatively quickly if sufficient resources and momentum were put behind the program. “I think we could do the job in about the time that it actually required to build the first atom bomb if enough trained scientific brainpower simultaneously began thinking about and working towards a solution,” he said. “Actually, the biggest deterrent to scientific progress is a refusal of some people, including scientists, to believe that things which seem amazing can really happen… I know that if Washington decides that it is vital to our national survival to go where we want and do what we want without having to worry about gravity, we’d find the answer rapidly.” Transcribed full text versions of Talbert’s articles “Conquest of Gravity Aim of Top Scientists in U.S.,” “Space-Ship Marvel Seen If Gravity is Outwitted,” and “New Air Dream – Planes Flying Outside Gravity” can be found online here , while digital versions of the articles as they appeared in the New York Herald Tribune can be found through the Herald Tribune archives available through the ProQuest database or the New York Public Library system. An op-ed sent to the New York Herald Tribune in response to Talbert’s series., New York Herald Tribune The Aerospace Research Laboratories At Wright Patterson Air Force Base George Trimble, Clarence Birdseye, and Lawrence Bell weren’t the only ones interested in researching anti-gravity. Talbert’s series reported that nearly every major aerospace company at the time was involved in some way with researching “the gravity problem”: Convair, Lear, Sikorsky, Sperry-Rand Corp., General Dynamics, and Avro Canada. Just as Dr. Louis Witten mentioned off-hand in the closing seconds of his speech at the 27th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics, the United States Air Force also established its own gravity research project at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The project was initially known as the General Physics Laboratory of the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL), but its name was changed to Aerospace Research Laboratories at some point. To head the project, the Air Force hired physicist Joshua N. Goldberg who had recently received his PhD from Syracuse University. According to Goldberg’s Curriculum Vitae , he served as a research physicist at Wright Patterson’s Aerospace Research Laboratories from 1956 to 1962, as well as teaching graduate-level classical mechanics at the Ohio State University Extension at Wright Patterson. Goldberg’s publications from that period show he published a number of theoretical articles in academic journals while working at Wright Patterson, including titles such as “ Conservation Laws in General Relativity ”, “ Measurement of Distance in General Relativity ”, and “ Einstein Spaces with Four-parameter Holonomy Group .” Many of Goldberg’s peers at Wright Patterson likewise produced peer-reviewed research in general relativity while at Wright Patterson. Numbers vary, but some accounts say dozens of studies were produced by Goldberg’s group. Some of the reports published from that era include equation-dense publications like “ Some Extensions of Liapunov’s Second Method ” by J.P. LaSalle and “ Gravitational Field of a Spinning Mass as an Example of Algebraically Special Metrics ” by Roy Kerr. Physical Review Letters Viewpoints differ on the nature of the research conducted at Wright-Patterson under this program. Some have posited that it had to do with actually trying to develop anti-gravity propulsion, while others say its goals were far more mundane. Nevertheless, the research supported by the Air Force led to what some science historians have called the “Golden Age of Relativity,” a title disputed by others , such as German physicist Hubert Goenner, who argues that “to a great extent what was named the ‘Golden age of relativity’ in the United States, may have been nothing but a feature of a general trend in physics after the ‘Sputnik’-shock.” It’s often claimed that the institute at Wright Patterson and other associated Air Force-funded laboratories were set up merely to investigate reports of Russian anti-gravity research to see if America’s adversaries had achieved what the United States had not been able to. The anti-gravity research conducted at Wright Patterson concluded in the early 1970s with the passage of the Mansfield Amendments. The first of these, passed in 1970, limited “military funding of research that lacked a direct or apparent relationship to a specific military function.” According to an Office of Technology Assessment report delivered to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991, these Mansfield Amendments for some years somewhat slowed the rate of U.S. military research into the types of lofty, abstract topics studied at Wright Patterson throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Following those Amendments, the Department of Defense’s research strategy shifted more towards the proposal-grant model seen at university and private laboratories today. That is not to say that the U.S. military’s research into gravitation ended with the Mansfield Amendments or was limited solely to Goldberg’s group at Wright Patterson. There is a wealth of research in the public realm that shows the Air Force’s research into these concepts continued long after the scientists at that base moved on to long careers in academia. In 1972, an ad hoc group with Franklin Mead, then Senior Aerospace Engineer with the Air Force Aerospace Research Laboratories, serving as editor had published a technical report titled “ Advanced Propulsion Concepts – Project Outgrowth ” for the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base. The document discusses various advanced propulsion concepts ranging from traditional rocket propulsion to “anti-gravity propulsion,” to which an entire chapter is dedicated. Two main approaches are outlined in Project Outgrowth: those using gravitational absorption, and those based on unified field theory which unites electromagnetism and gravitation. While the document notes that these approaches would “require some major breakthroughs in materials,” it points out that “no new or radical change in fundamental physics” would be required to make these breakthroughs a reality. In other words, Mead and the rest of the study group believed that these types of breakthrough propulsion concepts may be possible once materials sciences caught up with concepts developed in theoretical physics. USAF Throughout the expansive Project Outgrowth document, Mead and the other scientists also explored field propulsion, defined as those concepts which use “electric and/or magnetic fields to accelerate an ionized working fluid, or react directly with the environment by electric or magnetic effects.” While a range of theoretical field propulsion approaches were analyzed, they concluded that “it would be impossible within the time constraints of this study to evaluate the field propulsion area completely,” noting however that “more radical concepts may be found in the open literature by those interested in pursuing them.” Still, the document contains quite a few curiosities. One chapter, titled “Electrostatic Effects,” describes the use of electric generators to charge giant metallic spheres buried in the ground six miles apart in symmetrical arrangements. Another sphere would be placed on top of the ground in the center of this arrangement of spheres, which would then be shot up to 620 miles into space when the other spheres are charged with an intense electrical current, according to the document. It is also claimed that vehicles flying in space with charged skins could be used to cause the spheres to change directions instantly without any loss of velocity or use of propellant. USAF As fascinating as this experiment sounds, there is nothing in the document to suggest the Air Force actually sent metal spheres flying into the sky, and the document points out that “analysis of this concept completely ignores the effect of the immense electric fields of the surrounding environment,” noting that ambient ions accumulating around the spheres would nullify the repulsion effect. “Handling and producing charged objects of the magnitude assumed for the analysis may be well beyond the reach of technology for decades to come“ and “all of the ideas discussed lack theoretical and technical merit,” the study group concluded. USAF The same document outlines theoretical approaches at using superconductors to achieve electromagnetic spacecraft propulsion, noting that the applications of high energy electromagnetic fields range far beyond propulsion: The greatest advantage of this concept is that the system is initially charged on earth with a tremendous amount of massless energy which is stored in a low-loss propulsion system. […] Similar to other low-thrust vehicles, this system is capable of accelerating to very high velocities when operating over great distances for substantial periods of time. […] This system could be used to decelerate vehicles approaching the Earth at high speed. Militarily, this concept could, with its high magnetic field, destroy, deflect, or severely damage incoming high-speed projectiles. USAF The Project Outgrowth document concludes by arguing that while many of these concepts are still out of the grasp of the USAF, advances in materials and engineering could make what in 1972 seemed like fantasy a reality in the decades to come: Obviously, advancements in certain areas of technology could make a number of concepts suddenly very attractive. Improvements in high energy lasers by several orders of magnitude of energy output or new concepts involving long-distance energy transfer would make both laser propulsion and infinite Isp ramjet very attractive. The development of higher current density superconductors, metallic hydrogen, or even room temperature superconductors would make many of the magnetic concepts more attractive. […] Radical departures from time-honored, well-proved approaches are either discarded or lack visualization. Possibly, not until man truly becomes a creature of space will the restrictions imposed on his imagination be removed and radically new propulsion concepts devised. We are just beginning to understand the true nature of space and to attempt to utilize this environment for our propulsion needs. The same concepts explored in the Project Outgrowth document were later examined by subsequent Air Force-funded studies. In 1988, the New York-based Veritay Technology, Inc. submitted the document “ 21st Century Propulsion Concept ” to the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory (AFAL) at Edwards Air Force Base. The document looks at the Biefield-Brown effect, a controversial theory that claims that electrical fields can produce propulsive forces sometimes referred to as ionic wind. The AFAL was able to generate minuscule measures of propulsion with the concept, but concluded that “ion propulsion effects are negligible.” A similar report from 1989 titled “ Electric Propulsion Study ” also complied for the Astronautics Laboratory at Edwards outlines a variety of theories and experiments that explore the interactions between gravitational, electrical, and electromagnetic fields. Concepts like ionic wind, the Mach effect, and various applications of high energy electromagnetic fields are discussed. One brief chapter explores the concept of inertial mass variation using a rotating cylinder filled with mercury. The Air Force concluded that the experiment showed little promise and that “no AFAL action is suggested at this time” but that “should an experiment by external agencies be done with positive results, then this area should be reconsidered.” Ultimately, the document concludes that while much of the research it cites is still in its infancy, inertial mass reduction techniques may offer the most promising results with further study: It is recommended that policies and plans take into consideration long time studies in the area of gravity and inertia. These areas deserve more emphasis. This is likely to be more important than any single experimental program. Since chemical propulsion is reaching its theoretical limits and nuclear propulsion has political difficulties, it is more likely that gravitational and electromagnetic studies will lead to future breakthroughs than any nuclear force studies (with the possible exception of more recent low temperature fusion work). The Air Force continues to look into ways of defying gravity without the use of propellants and some technical reports maintain that this will soon be possible. According to the 2006 study “Advanced Technology and Breakthrough Physics for 2025 and 2050 Military Aerospace Vehicles ” which was published by the American Institute of Physics, some scientists claim that next-generation propulsion may be achieved sometime within the next three decades. The study was compiled at the request of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and examines the technological breakthroughs that researchers believed could be developed and implemented by 2025 and 2050. The conceptual “2050 vehicle” featuring hypothetical inertial mass reduction technology which is theorized to extract energy from the quantum vacuum., American Institute of Physics While most of the report centers around compact fusion reactors and the developments of new high temperature composite materials, the section on the “2050 Vehicle” predicts that the jet propulsion and power systems of this hypothetical aircraft will come in the form of propellant-less field propulsion based on the principle of inducing mass fluctuations using high-frequency electromagnetic fields: One example of propellant-less field propulsion […] proposes the use of high voltage and high frequency electromagnetic (em) field pulsations to induce mass fluctuations within the electronic and ionic structure of dielectric materials – to cause a favorable “gravinertial” field coupling with nearby and distant matter that results in unidirectional force. Of course, as we now know, the USAF isn’t the sole branch of the military openly looking into next-generation hypothetical vehicles based on concepts of electromagnetic fields and inertial mass variation. Based on the recent announcement declaring a partnership with TTSA, we know even the U.S. Army is also exploring similar concepts for next-generation ground vehicles that exploit the same principles the USAF has explored for decades: mass manipulation, electromagnetic metamaterial waveguides, and quantum physics. Civilian Research Into Gravitation, Electromagnetism, And Propulsion The military isn’t the only sector that has for decades conducted research that has explored the boundaries of aerospace propulsion and general relativity. In 1996, NASA funded an endeavor known as the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics (BPP) Program which invited some of the brightest minds in physics and aerospace engineering to propose radical new ideas to propel spaceflight into a new paradigm. In a paper outlining the BPP program presented at the Second Symposium on Realistic Near-Term Advanced Scientific Space Missions in 1998, its director, Marc Miller, offered an overview of NASA’s aims for the project, noting that “it is known from observed phenomena and from the established physics of General Relativity that gravity, electromagnetism, and spacetime are inter-related phenomena” and that “these ideas have led to questioning if gravitational or inertial forces can be created or modified using electromagnetism.” Many of the ideas Miller and the NASA BPP program describes were developed or are better understood thanks to the research funded by Wright Patterson, including Hermann Bondi’s concept of negative mass (Bondi’s group at Kings College, London received funding from the U.S. Air Force) and Joshua Goldberg’s theory of gravitational radiation . In an attempt to achieve breakthrough propulsion based on these concepts, NASA’s project identified three major barriers that stood in the way of their main goal of achieving interstellar travel: (1) MASS: Discover new propulsion methods that eliminate or dramatically reduce the need for propellant. This implies discovering fundamentally new ways to create motion, presumably by manipulating inertia, gravity, or by any other interactions between matter, fields, and spacetime. (2) SPEED: Discover how to attain the ultimate achievable transit speeds to dramatically reduce travel times. This implies discovering a means to move a vehicle at or near the actual maximum speed limit for motion through space or through the motion of spacetime itself (if possible, this means circumventing the light speed limit). (3)ENERGY: Discover fundamentally new modes of on board energy generation to power these propulsion devices. This third goal is included since the first two breakthroughs could require breakthroughs in energy generation, and since the physics underlying the propulsion goals is closely linked to energy physics. In 1997, NASA’s Lewis Research Center, now known as the John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field, held a conference on these breakthrough propulsion concepts, the proceedings of which are worth a read and contain titles such as “Inertial Mass as a Reaction of the Vacuum to Accelerated Motion”, “Force Field Propulsion”, and “The Zero-Point Field and the NASA Challenge to Create the Space Drive”. From what little we know or think we know about Salvatore Cezar Pais , the elusive inventor of the Navy’s intriguing if not puzzling anti-gravity ‘UFO’ patents that we’ve explored in our previous reporting, he was working on his PhD dissertation at Case Western Reserve University while serving as a NASA Graduate Student Research Fellow at NASA’s John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field at the time of the conference. There’s no concrete evidence that Pais attended the workshop, but according to the document’s foreword, 12 students were in attendance. The table of contents for the conference proceedings lists a total of 449 pages, the last of which is a list of workshop participants. However, the versions available online stop at page 389. We are currently pursuing a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the missing pages. Confirming Pais’ presence at the conference would be significant because many of the exact same revolutionary concepts that NASA was exploring in terms of unlocking new forms of propulsion and space travel are the same types of concepts found throughout the patents for his “ hybrid aerospace-underwater craft ” and “ high energy electromagnetic field generator .” Many of the participants at NASA’s workshop are also cited throughout Pais’ patents and publications. Placing Pais at the conference would add to the body of evidence which suggests the technologies in the Navy’s patents may have been in the works for the past 20 years, at least as far as the inventor is concerned. In reality though, as we’ve laid out here, many of the concepts in Pais’ patents are similar to those which were researched at Wright-Patterson and other facilities in the 1950s and are still being explored today. Aside from NASA, academic and independent laboratories have been researching the same principles and approaches the Air Force and other military laboratories have been looking into for decades. One of the most commonly researched areas is in hypothetically reducing an aircraft’s mass using electromagnetism, preferably to zero, and several Lockheed Martin researchers have been involved with quite a few theoretical studies into altering inertial mass (see Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff, 1998 ; Rueda and Haisch, 1998 ; Haisch and Rueda, 1999 ; and Woodward, Mahood, and March 2001 ). A large body of peer-reviewed research into mass reduction involves using advanced superconducting materials such as yttrium barium copper oxide, or YBCO (see Podkletnov and Nieminen, 1992 ; Li et al, 1997 ; and Podkletnov and Modanese, 2001 ). Some of these studies, many of them more than 20 years old, reported observing mass reductions of up to two percent. Of course, just because scientists report a peer-reviewed result doesn’t mean their data can’t be challenged or have been impacted by spurious factors. Other attempts to overcome and harness gravity focus on the use of electromagnetic fields. In the 2007 publication “ The Connection between Inertial Forces and the Vector Potential ”, researchers found a connection between electric and magnetic fields, writing that there is a “possibility to manipulate inertial mass” and potentially “some mechanisms for possible applications to electromagnetic propulsion and the development of advanced space propulsion physics.” In 2010, an Air Force-funded study at the University of Florida leveraged these principles to design and test a “ Wingless Electromagnetic Air Vehicle (WEAV) ” which is claimed to employ “no moving parts and assures near-instantaneous response time.” The study writes that this vehicle is designed to support the Air Force Research Laboratory’s strategy to “deliver precision effects: ubiquitous, swarming sensors and shooters” by 2015-2030. The study was able to produce a disc that “was able to hover a few millimeters above the surface for a sustained duration (about three minutes)” and noted that “prototypes of varying radius were also successfully ‘flown’, demonstrating that WEAV is scalable.” Air Force Office of Scientific Research Many other approaches have focused on the unique properties of novel materials. The 2007 publication “ Direct Experimental Evidence of Electromagnetic Inertia Manipulation Thrusting ” reports “new experimental results suggesting that ‘propellantless’ propulsion without conventional external assistance has been achieved by means of electromagnetic inertia manipulation” using piezoelectric materials, compounds that change shape when subjected to an electrical charge. In fact, several researchers have reported significant results in mass manipulation using a specific piezoelectric compound, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), which is found throughout several of the Navy’s recent patents. One physicist in particular,  Dr. James Woodward of California State Fullerton, has found repeated success in altering the mass of small test samples of PZT. While the levels of mass reduction Woodward has observed are tiny, so are the samples and energy levels he has used. Still, in one study published with aerospace engineer Paul T. March, then at Lockheed Martin, the authors note that “very large mass fluctuation effects should be producible with only relatively modest power levels,” but are beyond the scope and scale of their study. Even so, Woodward’s results have been so promising that at least two Air Force studies, the 1989 technical report “ Electric Propulsion Study ” and the 2017 paper “ Movement and Maneuver in Deep Space : A Framework to Leverage Advanced Propulsion”, call attention to his research in particular and note that his approach seems most promising. However, the 2017 Air Force paper notes that “obvious institutional and funding barriers stand in the way” and that “materials science and engineering work would be required to produce new piezoelectric materials and compensate for natural resonance, mechanical fatigue, and thermal effects.” Perhaps for that reason and for likely many more, various branches of the Armed Forces have for years been actively researching metamaterials that can propagate high energy electromagnetic fields. Navy budget documents show that between 2011 and 2016, the Navy’s In-House Laboratory Independent Research program conducted research into the “dispersion and control of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the microwave (RF) region, using fabricated metamaterial structures”. Department of Defense Starting in 2017, the Navy combined several program elements under one title, changing the way individual projects are reported in their budget and thus making it more difficult to know whether this metamaterial research continues today. Scratching The Surface While Not Knowing What Lies Beneath It The research cited here is only a brief look at a handful of the numerous studies the Air Force, other branches of the military, and various academic laboratories have conducted into “anti-gravity” and various propellantless propulsion methods, and only those that are available to the public. Anyone familiar with military research and development knows that there is a vast trove of projects, associated data, and technologies the public has yet to be shown and may never be shown. There have been hints of those secret technologies for years offered by insiders of some of America’s most high-level aerospace research and development outfits. For instance, Ben Rich, the second director of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, told Popular Science in 1994 the following: “We have some new things. We are not stagnating. What we are doing is updating ourselves, without advertising. There are some new programs, and there are certain things, some of them 20 or 30 years old, that are still breakthroughs and appropriate to keep quiet about [because] other people don’t have them yet.” With this in mind, it is possible that there are certain technologies in existence that once were, but may no longer be the things of science fiction. Regardless, when it comes to harnessing exotic methods of overcoming gravity, the U.S. military’s interest in doing so has continued since the 1950s, and civilian laboratories have been hot on their heels. We’re still pursuing answers to the enigma surrounding the recent Navy patents, but to say they have come out of the blue and have no scientific basis whatsoever seems to be not entirely accurate based on the decades of research we’ve presented here. The same principles and many of the same names cited in Salvatore Pais’ patents filed for the US Navy between 2015 and 2018 appear throughout numerous NASA studies, the peer-reviewed publications of the scientific community, and the long history of U.S. government-funded research into general relativity and breakthrough propulsion science. We have to stress once again that this doesn’t mean that actually realizing these concepts and putting them to use is possible at this time, or even ever in the future, for that matter. But it does show that there has been an incredibly long and detailed history of interest by the U.S. military and the scientific community in this exotic field that has resulted in significant amounts of research that spans nearly seven decades. All this occurred in spite of the fact that scientists realized as far back as the 1950s that the topic was largely taboo and often scoffed at by the larger scientific community. Once again, what exists behind the curtain of the classified realm is the big wildcard here. With so much research present in the unclassified environment, one can only guess as to just how far the military and their industry partners have actually gone in an effort to obtain the ‘Holy Grail’ of aerospace engineering. For some, that speculative answer may be not very far at all. For others, it may be quite the contrary. The fact is we just don’t know. But at least we do know that the topic, in general, isn’t quite as alien as it may seem.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 25, 2019",Coast Guard Cutters Once Carried Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles And They Could Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you mention the U.S. Coast Guard to someone, usually patrolling near America’s territorial waters, drug interdiction , and rescuing boaters come to mind, but the reality is that the Coastie’s mission ranges far from home and into some pretty nasty neighborhoods. At one time, this reality, combined with a very serious foe, resulted in some of the service’s most capable cutters being outfitted with RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles . Fast forward to today, and we may be on the precipice of another similar sea-change for the service in terms of how heavily armed some of its ships become. Coast Guard ships are deployed around the globe, from the volatile Persian Gulf to the disputed waters of the South China Sea to the very tense Taiwan Strait , to execute higher-end missions sometimes alongside their more heavily armed U.S. Navy counterparts. As so-called “great power competition” among peer state adversaries heats up, the Coast Guard is getting called on to fill more of these types of missions traditionally executed by Navy surface combatants. USCGC Bertholf , a Legend class National Security Cutter transitted the tense Taiwan Strait last March., USN In fact, it has just been announced that the U.S. Coast Guard will be sending three of its newest Fast-Response Cutters to Guam and intends to have a greater presence overall in the region in an attempt to help counter-balance adversaries’ growing influence and capabilities—namely China. Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz, speaking during a visit to the Philippines, part a large tour of the Indo-Pacific region, said that the Coast Guard is “doubling down on Oceana,” stating in part the following, according to Stars and Stripes : “In the face of coercive and antagonistic behavior from China, the U.S. Coast Guard offers transparent engagement and partnership at both the professional and personal levels… My goal for the United States Coast Guard is to be a transparent and preferred partner in the region. … We’re on a trajectory where the geostrategic importance of the Oceania region has not been higher here in decades… And it’s a place that the Coast Guard’s looking to be part of the whole-of-government solution set. … I think the Coast Guard operates below that level of lethality of the Department of Defense on the high-end side of things and above that level of diplomacy at State Department… We’re in that sort of sweet spot in the middle.” Currently, the Coast Guard’s most powerful vessels, the Legend class National Security Cutters (NSCs), are equipped with a 57mm deck gun, a Phalanx close-in weapon system (CIWS), and some smaller machine guns. It is also outfitted with the AN/SLQ-32V2 SEWIP electronic warfare suite. It has two hangar bays for a pair of helicopters or a helicopter and a handful of drones. The stern has a launch and recovery area for large rigid-hull inflatable boats, as well. Two U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Waesche crew members prepare to recover the 26-foot Over-The-Horizon boat., USCG In addition to weaponry and vehicles, these ships have a fairly impressive array of sensors that are supported by its advanced COMBATSS-21 combat management system—the same system used on the Littoral Combat Ships and is slated to be used on the Navy’s new frigate . Still, these ships lack any over-the-horizon weaponry and are not considered potential targets that can ‘bite back’ in anything but the lowest-end of skirmishes. National Security Cutter USCGC Waesche (WMSL 751) arrives at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, June 25, 2014., USN During the Cold War, a similar ‘great power competition’ reality led to the fielding of RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles aboard some of the Coast Guard’s Hamilton class high-endurance cutters. Beyond their core functions, ships were designed in the early 1960s to be able to hunt and kill submarines if need be. They had sonar, torpedo tubes, decoy launchers, and more for that mission. These anti-submarine capabilities were upgraded in the 1980s along with other enhancements, such as a modernized deck gun, new sensors and combat systems, the addition of a hangar bay, and more under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization program. The Navy, which was trying to expand its capacity anyway possible under the Reagan-era naval buildup , saw the latent combat potential in the upgraded Hamilton class cutters. USCGC Hamilton (WHEC-715) seen with her Harpoon launchers. , Public Domain It was decided that the ships would get further upgrades, including the Phalanx CIWS, Mk38 25mm chain guns, and the RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles to drastically enhance their lethality. The Navy thought that the upgraded hardy ships could become “assets” instead of “liabilities” when used in more hostile areas for patrols and could even be called upon to fight during an open conflict against a capable foe. The transcript below gives some background on this initiative as it was maturing into the early 1990s: Defense Appropriations Senate Hearing transcripts for FY1992. , US Gov Documents The whole fleet of a dozen Hamilton class cutters did not receive this additional upgrade package, but at least USCGS Hamilton , USCGS Morgenthau, and USCGS Mellon did. Still, the Mk38s and Phalanx would eventually find their way onto all the ships in the class. Mellon was the only Hamilton class cutter to fire a Harpoon missile. The test of the ship’s new firepower occurred in 1990., USCG This configuration only lasted for a short while. The Harpoons and the class’s upgraded anti-submarine warfare capabilities would be eliminated in just a few years time. In the end, the Harpoon’s short career with the Coast Guard was largely about the massive cost cuts that came after the fall of the Soviet Union, not the relevance of the concept itself. The missiles were gone from the ships by the mid-1990s. USCGC Boutwell (WPG-719; WHEC-719) in foreground; then directly starboard of Boutwell is the USCGC Jarvis (WHEC-725) which is moored ahead of the USCGC Munro (WHEC-724). Munro is astern of Jarvis and inboard of the Morgenthau (WHEC-722)—note the Harpoon launchers on Morgenthau directly behind her main battery—and finally the USCGC Sherman (WPG-720; WHEC-720) is directly astern of the Munro. Photo taken in 1992., USCG Fast forward to today and we are back into a similar if not more complicated strategic situation. The Navy desperately needs more surface combatant capacity, but will have a very hard time realizing its lofty goal of achieving a 355 ship fleet in the coming decades. In the meantime, the Coast Guard is stepping up its commitment to help out, as the Admiral discussed above. On top of this, the entire Navy and Marine corps are pushing towards a new era of distributed warfare —one in which cruise missiles could find themselves on all types of new platforms, including sealift ships . The idea is to leverage new modular standoff weaponry to diversify and drastically increase the number of platforms that can execute attacks on ships and on targets onshore at any given time around the globe. This drastically increases the enemy’s defensive and offensive challenges and allows for more efficiency and capacity when it comes to engaging time-sensitive and opportunistic targets. RGM-84 launch., Navy The truth is that in many ways the Legend class National Security Cutters are more capable than the Navy’s own Littoral Combat Ships. The LCSs have many known deficiencies , but they pack similar defensive armament, decoys, sensors, and combat systems as the NSCs. In fact, the NCSs have AN/SLQ-32 SEWIP electronic warfare suites that not only help protect the ship in hostile waters, they can also be used to generate Harpoon or other anti-ship missile targeting information passively by homing in and geolocating enemy RF emissions. The Littoral Combat Ships lack SEWIP entirely, but do have some electronic support measures systems. The Navy has rushed to get anti-ship missile capability onto the woefully under-armed LCSs in recent years, with the first operational deployment of the very capable Naval Strike Missile aboard one of these ships happening just weeks ago. You can and should read about the Naval Strike Missile—which is capable of striking maritime and land targets—in this past feature of ours . Beyond the Naval Strike Missile, the Harpoon has never been more lethal as it is getting new upgrades that will keep it relevant for years to come. So, why not bolt NSM or Harpoon launchers onto the National Security Cutters that will be deploying on overseas patrols in hostile areas, just like the what the Navy has done for the LCS? Independence class littoral combat ship USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS-10) launches a Naval Strike Missile (NSM) during exercise Pacific Griffin on October 1st, 2019., USN As it turns out, the Coast Guard has already admitted to the possibility of arming their ships that will operate in or very near contested environments with cruise missiles. This specifically came up during a congressional hearing in 2017 in regard to the Coast Guard’s badly needed future icebreakers that will operate in the Arctic. We published a piece on this development and in it, we quoted Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft as telling the House Homeland Security Committee members the following: “We need to look differently at what an icebreaker does… We need to reserve space, weight and power if we need to strap a cruise missile package on it… U.S. presence in the Arctic is necessary for more than just power projection; it’s a matter of national security… If they remain unchecked, the Russians will extend their sphere of influence to over five million square miles of Arctic ice and water.” For decades, the core mission of executing anti-surface warfare via cruise missile had been neglected by the Pentagon, but now it is becoming a high priority across the services. From American nuclear fast attack submarines being reequipped with Harpoons after decades without them, as well as the new Tactical Tomahawk that has anti-ship capabilities, and even more exotic classified anti-ship missiles , to the USAF working to master the delivery of a new generation of standoff naval mines , to the Navy fielding the stealthy Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), to the F-35 being slated to receive the Joint Strike Missile , to the Army even looking to get into the ship-killing business, a new era of anti-ship missile capabilities is rapidly emerging. This is due to the ballooning surface warfare capacity of America’s biggest military competitor, China. Russia’s revamping of its own naval fleet is also a catalyst behind this anti-ship cruise missile renaissance of sorts. USS Donald Cook fires a Harpoon during an exercise. , USN With all this in mind, it’s somewhat puzzling that the Coast Guard and its Navy partners haven’t already gone ‘back to the future’ and worked to arm at the NSCs with anti-ship missiles when they deploy for long overseas patrols in hostile areas. Cost-wise, such an endeavor is relatively affordable, especially if the Navy were to help out as these weapon systems are quite modular in nature and can be switched between ships as they cycle in and out of a region. As laid out above, the proof of concept already exists. Regardless, considering we now live in an age of netcentric and increasingly platform-agnostic warfare, the concept is much more relevant now than it was 30 years ago. The added possibility that far less capable vessels could be armed with similar weapons in the future makes doing so with the National Security Cutters too obvious to ignore. NSC during sea trials. , Huntington Ingalls To recap, the idea of arming some of the USCG’s most capable ships with anti-ship missiles when they are operating in tense areas far from home is more relevant now than ever because: The initiative to drastically expand the distributed warfare concept of operations The same concept was deployed under similar circumstances at the end of the Cold War It is already being discussed/considered for the service’s future icebreakers Increased USCG presence in Asia’s contested waters NSCs are already operating in higher threat areas Doing so would allow for more independent operations without the need of Navy surface combatants nearby in some situations Modular nature of these weapon systems makes them easier and cheaper to deploy and swap among hulls Netcentric warfare concepts mean these ships can be ready and called upon remotely to strike targets of opportunity at a moment’s notice, even targets their own sensors cannot see Transforms USCGCs from liabilities to assets in higher-risk environments Would be part of the massive and ongoing push to revamp America’s anti-ship missile capabilities and concepts of operation Naval Strike Missile and upgraded Harpoon are off-the-shelf solutions that could be bolted on and easily integrated LCS has already undergone a similar upgrade and shares similar sensors and the same combat system as NSC Navy doesn’t have enough surface combatants to fulfill demands and will have trouble ever realizing its 355 ship goal Adding anti-ship missile capabilities is being examined for far less capable ships So, what do you think? Is it time to ‘up-gun’ some of the USCG’s most capable vessels that consistently operate in dangerous waters far from home? Let us know in the comments below.

Brett Tingley and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 9, 2020",Scientist Behind The Navy’s “UFO Patents” Has Now Filed One For A Compact Fusion Reactor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone has been reporting on a set of bizarre patents assigned to the U.S. Navy that describe radical new technologies that could absolutely revolutionize the aerospace field, and frankly, the very way we live our lives. These include high-energy electromagnetic fields used to create force fields and outlandish new methods of aerospace propulsion and vehicle design that basically read as UFO-like technology. You can learn all about these patents, their viability, and the issues surrounding them in these exclusive features of ours . Now, the same mysterious Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division engineer behind those patents has produced another patent—one for a compact fusion reactor that could pump out absolutely incredible amounts of power in a small space—maybe even in a craft. Energy dominance has become a cornerstone of American military policy as laboratories seek to develop the ‘Holy Grail’ of power generation: nuclear fusion. These attempts at developing stable fusion reactors utilize incredibly powerful magnetic fields in order to contain the nuclear reactions occurring inside. Creating a stable fusion reaction is difficult enough, but some laboratories are going even further by attempting to create compact reactors small enough to fit inside shipping containers or even possibly vehicles. The form of nuclear power generation employed in nuclear reactors today is fission, in which unstable isotopes of uranium and other radioactive materials are bombarded with particles, splitting them apart and releasing energy. Fusion, on the other hand, involves uniting atoms of hydrogen isotopes like Tritium and Deuterium under extreme pressure and temperature to produce helium isotopes and neutrons, a process that releases large amounts of energy. If it can be achieved, nuclear fusion would be a massive improvement over fission in that it produces much lower levels of radioactive waste and greenhouse gases, does not require enriched nuclear material that could be used to produce weapons, has a far lower risk of meltdown, and can be powered by more sustainable fuel sources. Fusion has long been hailed as a long-term solution to humankind’s energy needs. While nuclear physicists and engineers have been conducting experiments with fusion reactor designs for decades, it remains challenging, to say the least, to engineer systems that can contain temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees Fahrenheit and extremely high pressures. Most of the world’s ‘successful’ fusion reactors are currently only able to maintain plasma discharges for periods of time measured in minutes or even seconds. Even more challenging is designing nuclear fusion reactors that are mobile, such as ones that might fit inside a shipping container or a ship. Currently, most of the world’s experimental fusion reactors are the size of large buildings and the ultimate goal of much current research is to develop compact fusion reactor systems, or CFRs, small enough to work on a ship or possibly even an aircraft. In spite of these hurdles, think tanks, such as the American Security Project, believe that fusion reactors in the 21st Century will provide low cost, carbon-free energy to the world, and predict that the United States can lead the world in finally realizing safe and stable nuclear fusion reactors. The War Zone has been reporting on Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works work to create a game-changing compact fusion reactor. The elite aerospace design unit has been constructing a new, more powerful experimental reactor as recently as July 2019. Aside from Lockheed Martin, several private firms have been developing their own compact fusion reactors in recent years, and the government-run Chinese Academy of Sciences has claimed to have made significant progress in developing fusion reactors that could one day be capable of producing revolutionary levels of energy. Skunk Works team members at work on their experimental compact fusion reactor., Lockheed Martin While Lockheed Martin’s CFR designs have garnered quite a bit of media attention and internet buzz in recent years, it appears one of the Skunk Works’ major clients is also hard at work in this field. The U.S. Navy has filed a potentially revolutionary patent application for a radical new compact fusion reactor that claims to improve upon the shortcomings of the Skunk Works CFR, and judging from the identity of the reactor’s inventor, it’s sure to raise eyebrows in the scientific community. This latest design is the brainchild of the elusive Salvatore Cezar Pais, the inventor of the Navy’s bizarre and controversial room temperature superconductors , high energy electromagnetic field generators, and sci-fi-sounding propulsion technologies that The War Zone has previously reported on. The patent for Pais’ “Plasma Compression Fusion Device” was applied for on March 22, 2018, and was just published on September 26, 2019. The claim states, in part: “At present there are few envisioned fusion reactors/devices that come in a small, compact package (ranging from 0.3 to 2 meters in diameter) and typically they use different versions of plasma magnetic confinement. Three such devices are the Lockheed Martin (LM) Skunk Works Compact Fusion Reactor (LM-CFR) , the EMC2 Polywell fusion concept, and the Princeton Field-Reversed Configuration (PFRC) machine. […] These devices feature short plasma confinement times, possible plasma instabilities with the scaling of size, and it is questionable whether they have the ability of achieving the break – even fusion condition, let alone a self-sustained plasma burn leading to ignition.” It is claimed in the patent application that this plasma compression fusion device is capable of producing power in the gigawatt (1 billion watts) to terawatt (1 trillion watts) range and above with input power only in the kilowatt (1,000 watts) to megawatt (1,000,000 watts) range. By comparison, America’s largest nuclear power plant, the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona, generates around 4,000 megawatts (4 gigawatts), and the A1B nuclear reactors designed for the Navy’s Gerald R. Ford -class aircraft carriers generate around 700 megawatts . The patent even claims that the device can “possibly lead to ignition plasma burn, that is self-sustained plasma burn without need for external input power.” Patent documentation showing the spinning, electrically-charged fusors (200) which are claimed to be able to contain nuclear plasma (75) in a high-energy magnetic field., USPTO Most fusion reactor designs employ magnetic confinement to contain fusion reactions. This involves torus-shaped coils of superconductors to produce powerful magnetic fields that confine a reactor’s plasma core. The Navy’s new plasma compression fusion device, however, claims as its key feature the same principle as in Salvatore Pais’ other inventions: the “controlled motion of electrically charged matter via accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin subjected to smooth yet rapid acceleration transients, in order to generate extremely high energy/high intensity electromagnetic fields.” Pais cites some of his prior publications as evidence that this type of spinning, vibrating electromagnetic system can create the high magnetic fields required to contain powerful fusion reaction in a stable form. The patent describes how those magnetic fields are generated within a hollow plasma chamber which includes one or more opposing pairs of conical or domed “counter-spinning dynamic fusors” that feature an electrically charged outer surface containing ducts that inject fuel gases, such as Deuterium or Deuterium-Xenon, into the plasma chamber. As these electrically-charged fusors spin, Pais claims, they “create a concentrated magnetic energy flux and electromagnetic radiation within the vacuum chamber,” compressing and heating the gasses within. These fusors vibrate at a high rate as they spin thanks to piezoelectric films such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) – the same piezoelectric metamaterial Pais claims enables his room-temperature superconductor patent . Cross-section of one of the conical fusors. Shown are orifices (235) used to inject fuel into the plasma core and the toroidal magnetic coils (203) which generate magnetic fields., USPTO Like the other bizarre Salvatore Pais patents we’ve covered previously, the extent to which this patent represents an operable, functioning, or even feasible technology isn’t clear. The Navy has vouched for some of his designs in the past, however, going so far as to claim these inventions actually exist in an operable form and that they are needed for national security purposes, most notably to keep pace with adversaries like China . But unlike some of Pais’ patents, this application sailed through the United States Patent and Trademark Office without rejection and subsequent appeal. Curiously, the patent states that “the invention will be discussed in a space, sea, or terrestrial environment” but notes that “this invention can be utilized for any type of application that requires the use of energy generation.” It is unclear what type of application may exist other than space, sea, or land. Salvatore Pais is clearly a busy man finding novel applications for high energy electromagnetic fields, and the Navy is patenting some truly science-fiction-like next-generation technologies that if realized, have the potential to change the course of technological development as we know it. Yes, some will likely wonder if this could be the power source that goes along with his other recent “UFO patents”—the engine needed to complete a seemingly otherworldly craft of some sort. The procession of these patents and their potential relation to one another is certainly intriguing, to say the least. To be frank, we at The War Zone have no idea what is going on here. We have tried to get the Navy to give us some perspective on why these patents were filed, whether they are based on legitimate technology, and why they were ever made public. The Navy remains unwilling to discuss them. At the same time, nearly every physicist we have talked to thinks all of these patents are beyond the realm of known physics and are almost laughable in terms of viability. At the same time, all this is occurring as the Navy, and the Navy alone out of all of the branches of the U.S. military, continues to discuss the fact that its pilots are encountering unexplained aerial phenomena at an alarming rate . With all this in mind, is the Navy building some sort of incredible craft based on science that remains foreign to the larger scientific community? Did they already do this years ago and are just slowly lifting the veil now? Are they clumsily trying to emulate what their pilots are seeing in the field, but can not yet fully explain? Could these patents just represent gross mismanagement of resources on the Navy’s behalf? Or is this all some sort of elaborate disinformation play by the Navy—one that seems to have emerged right in step the rise of major peer-state competition from the likes of Russia and China, and the biggest expansion of advanced aerospace development programs in decades? At this time we have no way to give you a definitive answer, but we will continue to investigate in hopes of one day being able to do just that. We’ve reached out to physicists for comment on this patent and will update this story once we receive their opinions.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 10, 2020","This Isn’t A Sci-Fi Prop, It’s A Doomsday Navigator For America’s Deadliest Cold War ICBM","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The subject in the striking image above looks like the centerpiece prop in a high-end sci-fi flick, but it is anything but. What you are looking at is the Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere (AIRS) guidance system that was designed to be used as the navigational heart of the highly-accurate LGM-118A Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), also known as the MX (Missile Experimental). Peacekeeper represented the pinnacle of Cold War-era American ICBM technology, but it came at a very high price and with a less than favorable developmental timeline. Even though it dwarfed its Minuteman III stablemate, and it was advanced in many ways, AIRS was by far the most exquisite piece of technology associated with the MX/Peacemaker program. In fact, the system’s existence was a major factor in the Peacekeeper’s reason for being. The masterful image was taken by photographer and author Martin Miller who had taken up the task of capturing Cold War weaponry in dramatic fashion. The photo seen in its entirety below was featured in Miller’s book Weapons Of Mass Destruction : Specters Of The Nuclear Age . ​ ​​​ In the book, Miller describes Peacekeeper’s super INS of sorts as such: The inertial guidance module used by the Peacekeeper missile, technically called an Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere (AIRS). The AIRS redefined the concept of accuracy possible for ICBMs. Rather than being gimbal-mounted, the sphere floats in a fluorocarbon fluid within an outer shell. The gyroscopes and accelerometers are positioned within the sphere as are the three hydraulic thrust valves and turbopump used to maintain stable orientation of the sphere. The labor to assemble its 19,000 individual parts was enormous . AIRS, Martin Miller So yeah, this thing was really something. In fact, some would argue it was among the most incredible pieces of technology that came out of the Cold War. AIRS was critical in lowering the circular error probable (CEP, aka accuracy) of the missile down to 40 meters. The Minuteman III, which remains in service today, has a CEP of roughly six times that. The very idea that an ICBM could be so accurate was a major factor in bringing the Peacekeeper to life in the first place under what was then known as the MX program. Nuclearweaponsarchive.org has a more detailed description of AIRS: The AIRS (Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere) is the most accurate inertial navigation (INS) system ever developed, and perhaps marks the end of a long process of continuous refinement of INS technology. This immensely complex and expensive INS unit has “third generation” accuracy as defined by Dr. Charles Stark Draper, the leading force in the development of hyper-accurate inertial guidance. This translates into INS drift rates of less than 1.5 x 10^-5 degrees per hour of operation. This drift rate is so low that the AIRS contributes on the order of only 1% of the Peacekeeper missile’s inaccuracy, and is thus effectively a perfect guidance system (i.e. a zero drift rate would not measurably improve the Peacekeeper’s performance). Very little of the precision of this guidance system is even exploited during a ballistic missile flight, it is mostly used simply to maintain guidance system alignment on the ground during missile alert without needing an external reference through precision gyrocompassing. Most ICBMs require an external alignment system to keep the INS in synch with the outside world prior to launch. The AIRS is probably as good as any INS for ICBM guidance needs to get. The penalty for this extreme level of accuracy is tremendous complexity and cost. The AIRS has 19,000 parts. In 1989 a single accelerometer used in the AIRS (there are three) cost $300,000 and took six months to manufacture. There are very few applications requiring such precise guidance and independence from external references. In fact, beyond ICBM guidance, none have been identified. If the requirement for complete autonomy is eliminated, extreme guidance accuracy is available at a small fraction of its cost and weight. For example, the advent of satellite positioning systems like GPS (Global Positioning System) and GLONASS, which permit centimeter-level accuracy over unlimited periods of operation with only a light inexpensive receiver. NASA spcecraft require extreme guidance precision, but use external navigation cues to obtain it. Even new nuclear weapon guidance programs have shown a willingness to sacrifice autonomy for cost and weight. The proposed BIOS (Bomb Impact Optimization System), a glide-bomb adaptation of the B-61, has proposed using GPS for guidance instead of an INS. Given the competition from advanced external reference-based approaches, INS technology has probably reached the end of the line as far as accuracy goes. Left: A display of the AIRS. Other images: AIRS in various stages of development. , Far left image: Fastfission/wikicommons. Other images: Public Domain The last paragraph is right on the money. Today, ring-laser gyro INS systems with embedded GPS come in tiny packages and can sustain massive G forces allowing them to be packed into everything from missiles to artillery shells. You can read all about these fascinating systems in this past piece of mine . A modern ring-laser gyro system. , Honeywell Before GPS was available to correct for drift, it’s amazing the lengths engineers went through to make inertial navigation systems as accurate as possible. Beyond making a near-perfect mechanical gyro-based INS at virtually all costs, other forms of navigation were used to help update less capable INS systems. Maybe the most capable were astronavigation units that found their way onto strategic aircraft like the SR-71 Blackbird and B-2. Even the Trident SLBM uses astronavigation to update its less capable INS. You can read all about these incredible systems here . The idea that Peacekeeper just used AIRS alone to be able to deliver up to a dozen nuclear warheads as far as some 9,000 miles from its launch point is a technological triumph that is far larger than it is given credit for. Even though the fact that AIRS was even possible helped bring Peacekeeper into existence, it also hurt its chances at wider deployment, among a number of other major factors. Even though it was literally the heart of the missile’s concept, its extreme complexity meant that the “operational” missiles that were deployed starting in 1986 didn’t even have an INS installed. They were useless. It wasn’t till 1988 that the missiles began to be fitted with this critical component. A Peacekeeper’s MIRVs impacting near Kwajalein Atoll during a long-range test launch., DoD Just 50 operational LGM-118As were ever deployed. They finally left the inventory entirely in 2005. In all reality, the START II treaty had a huge impact on the missile’s utility. If each missile was to be fitted with only a single warhead, the Minuteman III was a far cheaper way of sustaining America’s somewhat questionable ‘nuclear sponge.’ Also, the idea behind the Peacekeeper was being able to accurately hit Soviet warhead-packed ICBMs in their individual silos, something Minuteman wasn’t precise enough to do. The fact that Peacekeeper was never deployed under a survivable concept as originally envisioned also hurt its career. But Peacekeeper still stands as a technological marvel, with its incredibly complex, but incredibly capable AIRS being its true triumph in technology and made the missile concept worth pursuing at all during the twilight of the Cold War.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 18, 2019",Area 51 Has Its Own Unique Fleet Of HH-60U Ghost Hawk Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Almost everything about the U.S. military’s Area 51 flight test facility, also known as Groom Lake, is shrouded in secrecy and mystery. This even extends to the base’s small and unique fleet of HH-60U rescue helicopters, sometimes called Ghost Hawks, which at least help provide security, local search and rescue, and other types of utility support in and around the base. The Air Force is understood to have a total of four HH-60Us, one of which is seen at the top of this story and all of which are modified examples of the U.S. Army’s HH-60M Black Hawk medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), or “Dustoff,” helicopter. Area 51 watchers have determined that the U models are likely assigned to a unit colloquially know as the “ Ghost Squadron .” This helicopter unit is one of a number of secretive elements associated with Detachment 3, Air Force Flight Test Center, which appears to be one of the main Air Force entities at Groom Lake. Detachment 3 also reportedly oversees operations involving other more traditional aircraft and so-called “ Foreign Materiel Exploitation ,” or FME, examining non-American aircraft and systems at the secretive base, along with its other top-secret flight test duties. The history of how the U models came into existence is similarly convoluted and nebulous as the history of their present home. By the end of the 2000s, with the strains of the Global War on Terror, it had become painfully obvious to the Air Force that its fleets of already aging HH-60G Pave Hawks , the first of which rolled off Sikrosky’s production lines in the 1980s, were getting overworked. A US Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk., USAF The Air Force had kicked off a program to acquire new replacement combat search and rescue helicopters, known as CSAR-X, in 2006, but it had experienced numerous delays and contracting complications, a saga you can read about more in this past War Zone story . The service canceled the project for good three years later and subsequently began what it dubbed the Operational Loss Replacement (OLR) program. Originally, the plan was for the Air Force to piggyback on Army contracts to buy new UH-60Ms and then convert those helicopters to a configuration similar to the Pave Hawks. The Army’s Aviation and Missile Research and Development Center’s (AMRDEC) Prototype Integration Facility (PIF) at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama was responsible for the initial conversions, beginning in 2010. The new helicopters would be known as HH-60Us, a designation that caused particular consternation for Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Personnel Recovery Division of what was then known as the Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, which was managing the OLR program, according to documents the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In July 2010, this office put in a request to designate these helicopters as HH-60Ws, or, if that was not possible, as HH-60Ps. “We understand that DoD 4120-15 [the official U.S. military directive regarding assigned aircraft and missile designations] indicates that the series should be assigned in consecutive order,” the chief of the Rotary Wing Branch of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Personnel Recovery Division, who’s name is redacted in the request letter, wrote. “However, the ‘U’ which appears to be the next available series, has [a] negative connotation in the PR community.” The note about the “negative connotation” with the HH-60U designation, as well as the Air Force’s official description for what it originally wanted to call the HH-60W., USAF via FOIA The War Zone ‘s has had no luck in determining what this “negative connotation” is or was. One HH-60G pilot previously told the author that it could have to do with the “U” commonly standing for “unsatisfactory” across the Air Force. Whatever the case, the Air Force officials in charge of assigning aircraft designations rejected the request. It’s worth noting that, at this point, HH-60P had already been assigned to a rescue variant of the Black Hawk in service with the South Korean Air Force. In 2011, the PIF delivered two of the new HH-60Us, which the Air Force described as “ minimally modified ” UH-60Ms in 2011. With the exception of their gray rather than green pain jobs, these helicopters were largely indistinguishable from the Army’s HH-60M configuration. The U variants had the same FLIR Systems Talon sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras under a duckbill-like sponson on the front of the nose and the rescue hoist on the right side of the fuselage as their Army cousins. The new helicopters lacked the inflight refueling probe and nose-mounted weather radar of the earlier Pave Hawks, though the Air Force had said that it planned to add that capability in later conversions, along with range-extending internal fuel tanks. A US Army HH-60M., US Army However, by 2012, the Air Force was already reconsidering whether or not to continue buying new UH-60M-based helicopters or take a more potentially cost-effective approach of acquiring second-hand UH-60Ls , the variant that the HH-60G was originally based on, with low flight hours and converting them into Pave Hawks. The Air Force had also looked into a deep upgrade program for the existing Pave Hawks, known as the Block 152 configuration . A small number of HH-60Gs were converted to this standard, which most notably included repositioning the weather radar in the center of the nose, similar to the installation on the MH-60Ls, Ks, and Ms, assigned to the Army’s elite 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment . The modified Pave Hawks also had a more robust self-defense suite with radar warning receivers and missile warning sensors, as well as countermeasures dispensers loaded with flares and chaff built into the landing gear sponsons, in addition to the ones mounted on the rear fuselage. Some of these helicopters are based at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Public Domain Between 2012 and 2014, the Air Force took delivery of two more HH-60Us in the same general configuration, but eventually decided to go with the converted L models. The service took delivery of the first L-based HH-60G OLR helicopter in 2016. It’s unclear when the decision was made to send the small fleet of four Us to Groom Lake, but it seems plausible that it would have occurred after the decision to shift course in the OLR program. Lacking the inflight refueling probes and weather radars found on the G models, the HH-60Us are certainly better suited to shorter-range missions. Based on the M, with its more powerful General Electric T700-GE-701D engines, these helicopters would have had better hot-and-high performance than the HH-60G, making them even better candidates for replacing the small contingent of Pave Hawks that had previously supported activities at Area 51. The base sits in the Nevada desert at an altitude of around more than 4,400 feet with surrounding mountain peaks that are even higher. We do know that, by 2014, the Air Force’s 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, a special projects office better known as Big Safari, had taken responsibility for managing the HH-60Us. That year, the 661st Aeronautical Systems Squadron in Waco, Texas replaced the existing FLIR Systems sensor turrets on all of the helicopters with the L3 WESCAM MX-15HDi type. The goal of the upgrade was to “improve the pilots’ situational awareness when flying low, at night, in mountainous terrain. etc,” according to another Air Force document the author obtained via FOIA. “A high definition monitor was also added at the Flight Engineer’s crew station, as were a fixed and tethered hand controller, and a video recorder.” “The team also replaced the hoist system, which due to poor design saw the cable rubbing against the fuselage and presented a safety hazard,” the annual historical review added. “The modified helicopters typically delivered 35-40 days ahead of schedule.” USAF via FOIA Little else is known as the HH-60U’s present configuration, which likely also includes additional communications systems and other equipment to perform the security and search and rescue functions for Area 51. The extent of its activities, and whether the Air Force also uses the helicopters for research and development or operational test and evaluation purposes is also unclear. No available pictures indicate that these helicopters are armed, but any weapons mounted in the crew chief’s windows on either side of the aircraft, as is the case on standard Army Black Hawks, could be stowed when not in use. Personnel on board could easily carry small arms that they could use in flight or after inserting on the ground, as well. Tourists looking to get a peak of Area 51 from Tikaboo Peak, which sits some 26 miles away, have caught glimpses of the helicopters flying around the base. Video footage of one of the HH-60Us in action appeared online in June. The Dreamland Resort website also has a pair of photographs of one of the HH-60Us, serial number 10-20323, clearly showing its new MX-15HDi sensor turret, at Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center in Northwest Las Vegas, Nevada. The helicopter had reportedly dropped off a patient on Aug. 7, 2019. The Air Force Safety Center responded to a FOIA request from The War Zone regarding this by saying it had no records of any mishap that resulted in the transportation of any individual to Centennial Hills. It is possible that this could have been part of an exercise as Centennial Hills would certainly be a likely destination for any casualty from Groom Lake in the event of an actual emergency . Whether or not the Air Force would ever acquire additional HH-60Us is uncertain, but it would seem unlikely. Last year, Boeing and Italy’s Leonardo won the service’s competition to replace its aging UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters with a variant of the latter company’s AW-139, known as the MH-139 . Sikorsky, now a division of Lockheed Martin, had offered a version of the HH-60U. Sikorsky did win the Air Force’s Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) contract for the HH-60G replacement, which, interestingly enough, is another Black Hawk variant designated the HH-60W . So, in the end, the service’s Personnel Recovery community is getting a helicopter with the designation it wanted nearly a decade ago. It will be interesting to see if any HH-60Ws or MH-139s, the latter of which the Air Force intends to use for various security and light utility missions, eventually make their way to the Ghost Squadron to supplement or supplant the HH-60Us. In the meantime, we will be keeping our eyes out for any new details about Area 51’s unique helicopter fleet.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 15, 2020",This Image Of A Naval Strike Missile Launch Shows A Key Tenet Of Stealth Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Independence class Littoral Combat Ship USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS-10) is in the waters off Guam taking part in exercise Pacific Griffin, during which she fired off a Naval Strike Missile (NSM). This is a big deal considering giving the LCS more combat punch and a far longer kinetic reach has been a long time coming and the Naval Strike Missile is an incredibly capable and relevant weapon , as is its even more advanced cousin, the Joint Strike Missile .  Images and video from the launch were interesting, but one image, in particular, serves as a unique example of one of the basic tenets of low-observable “stealth” design. The Navy Strike Missile, which is a product of Norway’s Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace, was designed with reduced radar cross-section in mind, and especially from the head-on aspect from which it will barrel towards its maritime target. The missile uses passive imaging infrared, not radar, to locate and attack its prey. As a result, it doesn’t give away its presence by emitting RF radiation during its terminal phase of flight. It also isn’t susceptible to ‘soft kill’ electronic warfare tactics like jamming. In addition, its small radar cross-section makes it hard to spot on radar as it skims low and fast over the waves. Generally speaking, warships depend on a missile’s radar emissions and its radar signature to detect it and defend against it. Lacking one of these things entirely and manifesting the other in very limited quantities, you can imagine that the Naval Strike Missile is one diabolical and deadly anti-ship cruise missile. Oh, it also has a secondary land-attack capability, too. Beyond its faceted nose, trapezoidal airframe, and chined edges, the NSM achieves its low radar cross-section via the incorporation of composite structures. But just using composites for a missile’s wings and tail surfaces does not provide a high degree of low observability in itself. Using composites creatively along with underlying radar defeating shapes and structures does. It also happens to be a major low-observable trick that dates back to the dawn of stealth technology. You can see a great example of this type of stealthy design application on the intake of the NSM. Note the sawtooth edges surrounding the intake. That is a proven way to deflect radar energy away from its source and especially from the head-on aspect, which is where the most threatening radar systems will be pointing at the NSM as it makes its kamikaze run at its naval target. But that type of sawtooth structure isn’t the most conducive for an air inlet design, or for airframe design in general. The air inlet must provide consistent and even airflow to the jet engine buried at the end of its serpentine duct—also another stealth design trick . USN So, a seamless composite fairing that is translucent to the radar bands that are most likely to threaten such a missile is placed over the sawtooth edge. This provides the best of both worlds—low observability via a sawtooth leading edge, while the air doesn’t know the difference between a composite structure or a metallic one, and the radars that matter most don’t even “see” the fairing at all. It works very much like a composite radome on the nose of an aircraft, providing an aerodynamic necessity without being opaque to the radar’s beams. While we are most accustomed to hearing about radar-absorbent coatings on the skin of stealthy aircraft, these composite structures may be left without those coatings, letting the RF energy in to be dealt with via the structures and material it conceals, instead of attenuating it just by surface coatings and shape. You can see a very similar treatment was used in the creation of what would become known as the Blackbird family of legendary high-speed spyplanes. These aircraft were the first operational planes that incorporated low-observable technologies as major components of their designs., Lockheed/Public Domain This type of arrangement, and far more advanced ones, are used in low-observable aircraft like the F-117, B-2, F-22, F-35, and J-20 . For instance, the frontal area of a trapezoidal air inlet on a fighter jet may actually be a large composite structure that is invisible to certain radar frequencies, while concealing complex radar defeating structures and material underneath. A long and smooth wing leading edge may actually conceal highly intricate geometric structures that work as radar baffles and are buried below a radar translucent composite outer skin and a layer of radar-absorbing filler. We saw a glimpse of this recently when an F-22 with crumbling skin was flown to an air show. You can read my exclusive writeup on this unique peek into the shadowy world of low-observable design by clicking here . The U.S. no longer has a monopoly on stealth technology. China’s J-20 is a remarkable aircraft considering it is the country’s first low observable production aircraft., Chinese Internet You can see similar composite edge structures and sawtooth arrangements on this unpainted J-20., Chinese Internet Sometimes people superficially conclude there are ‘radar traps’ in certain areas of stealth aircraft just by looking at them. But what they may not realize is that even though a certain airframe component looks solid and opaque, it isn’t to radar and structures are concealed below them that deflect and attenuate radar returns. This ability to build almost two different airframes in one—one that is an aerodynamic and stealthy shaped outer shell of sorts, and one that sits below the skin with areas that provide massive decreases in radar reflectivity where it’s needed most, is truly fascinating. The fact that this is able to happen at all also creates the possibility that low-observable design teams and aerodynamic design teams can get to a point where both are satisfied while working together on a high-performance stealth aircraft. The F-22’s outer shell conceals advanced low observable technologies and material science that lies beneath., Air Force photo by Bill Orndorff The big takeaway here is that the blended relationship between these substructures and outer skins are usually not apparent when viewing stealthy aircraft visually. Their smooth skin can actually make stealthy aircraft look eerily simple in appearance, but an entirely different world lies beneath, and especially in key areas. This reality makes stealth aircraft even more of a technological accomplishment than they already appear to be, especially considering some of these designs are meant to be battered ruthlessly and heated and cooled for thousands of hours as they careen through the air under high G forces and rip across the sky at supersonic speeds. So, just remember, when it comes to stealthy aircraft and missiles, they are truly so much more than what meets the eye.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 16, 2019",China’s High-Speed Drone Is Rocket-Powered And All About Doing What Satellites Can’t,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s big 70th-anniversary parade marking the founding of the PRC has come and gone. There were a number of revelations, some of which we are still analyzing, but the biggest ones were in the unmanned space. In the days leading up to the parade, we had covered both of the most impressive unmanned vehicles that were to be displayed. It’s time to follow up with our analysis now that we have seen them in far greater detail. We posted our analysis on the GJ-11 Sharp Sword UCAV earlier today, now here are my takeaways from the official unveiling of the WZ-8—also referred to as the DR-8—high-speed reconnaissance drone. Before we get started, it’s important to note that the two WZ-8s put on display for the parade appear to be real aircraft, not mockups. It is unclear how representative they are of the current maturity of the program, but they are indeed real aircraft. Considering that the WZ-8 has been around for some time , these could be early demonstrators or an early production configuration, we just don’t know. A nice side-on image showing the WZ-8’s sleek profile and landing gear. , Chinese Internet My writeup from a week ago regarding this shadowy aircraft was largely spot on. The WZ-8 is an air-launched, high-speed, high-altitude, unmanned reconnaissance aircraft that is recoverable via a runway. It also looks a lot like some of the high-speed shapes China had been testing via high-altitude balloon drops in recent years. What’s new is that we now know its propulsion method—rocket engines. In other words, it isn’t an air breather. This isn’t surprising considering China’s struggles with advanced jet engine propulsion technology or how they would employ this aircraft operationally. Developing an engine that can operate at high supersonic speeds is a significant technological undertaking. Using rockets allows for a far more straightforward and available powerplant solution—one that can push the WZ-8 to extreme speeds, but also one that could limit its flexibility and range. The engine and flight control arrangement on the WZ-8 drone., China Internet A pair of small open-cycle, liquid-fueled, rocket engines can be seen configured in a side-by-side arrangement on the aircraft displayed. It is unclear if these engines would be reusable or if they are just single-use. We also don’t know their exact fuel type, but being rocket-powered, this craft could have the potential to climb to extreme altitudes, potentially nearing the edge of space. It could then use the speed and altitude it has acquired to continue on a quasi-ballistic trajectory before turning toward its recovery location once in thicker air and eventually gliding in for a landing. So we are not talking about something that is necessarily limited to SR-71 / A-12 / D-21 altitudes or kinetic performance here. A big question is how could it control itself above altitudes where traditional flight control surfaces are no longer useful?  Without a reaction control system of thrusters, which it does not have, it would probably be limited to flight below roughly 140,000 feet. With thrust vectoring, this may be able to be increased for a short period of time, but based on what I can see in the images, its engines do not appear to have such a capability. China Military With all this in mind, I believe this aircraft was built to fly primarily at the very upper reaches of where traditional control surfaces are effective, and maybe slightly beyond on a ballistic arch, for a brief period of time. This is still quite high— even at 135,000 feet, Mach 3.42 is 2,500 mph. When it comes to how fast this craft can go, it remains unclear. But high supersonic range would be my guess—somewhere between Mach 3.5 and Mach 4.5. Mach 4.5 at 135,000 feet is 3,285 mph. That isn’t quite hypersonic, but it is amazingly fast. China Military Even a 20-minute cruise at those speeds would allow such a craft to cover 1,100 miles. It is very likely air-launched from a specially outfitted H-6N bomber , so this wouldn’t include transit time to the launch area or its flight home, which would be a gliding descent to landing. I think it would be safe to say that this craft could have a range of 1,500 miles in total. That range and altitude would allow it to cover huge swathes of the South China Sea. In fact, it could launch from near Hainan Island and recover at one of China’s South China Sea island outposts and return on another mission. Its H-6 carriers can also range far out to sea, launching the drone in a very remote location and allowing it sweep massive areas of the Pacific for American carrier strike groups or make high-speed runs over the territory of potential foes. Swatting down a small target arriving unannounced at Mach 4.5 and 135,000 feet is no easy task, to say the least. If this craft can function well above the height at which standard control surfaces become ineffective, up to the edge of space, then it is likely hypersonic in nature. But at this time, we have no clear evidence that supports this possibility, although it is worth keeping it in mind as we learn more about this system in the coming years. China Military It isn’t clear what the aperture atop the nose is for. It could be for basic satellite communications for semi-autonomous control or even just periodic updates, but it could also be a celestial navigation system that would come in very handy considering its flight profile, mission set, and especially for operations in combat environments where satellite support is unassured. Such a system was used on the SR-71 Blackbird and the D-21 drone that landed in China’s own territory decades ago . You can read more about the Blackbird’s celestial navigations system, as well as others, some of which are still in use by America’s strategic forces, in this past feature of ours . A view from under the aircraft shows its smooth and largely flat belly. It will be interesting to see what reconaissance payloads China can integrate into an aircraft with such extreme performance. , Screencap So, what we are really talking about here is an asset that can be put into action with little notice and provide very prompt intelligence over critical areas, including those that are located substantial distances from the Chinese mainland. Above all else, it is just about as close to a perfect application as China is going to get for prosecuting a war in which its intelligence satellites may be blinded, jammed, disabled, or destroyed —an all too possible reality . It also gives the PLA the ability to gather intelligence in a survivable and rapid manner without the enemy knowing eyes are going to be overhead—a major limitation of traditional spy satellites. Such an intelligence-gathering capability has many applications, not just locating carrier strike groups. Just the function of providing damage assessments after ballistic and cruise missile strikes on strategic locations throughout the region would be incredibly important as the information it collects could save valuable missiles for other targets and allow PLA commanders to execute an accelerated anti-access campaign during a time of war. Still, many other basic questions remain, such as how is skin-friction heat attenuated and what sensor packages can be integrated into its svelte, arrowhead-like design. But overall, that’s where I am at with the WZ-8—who knows if that will end up being its official designation—at this time. The aircraft fits perfectly with China’s overall regional objectives and military strategy and it makes you wonder just what else they have up their sleeve.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 2, 2020","No, Passive Radar Isn’t Going To Make Stealth Technology Obsolete Anytime Soon","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier today, C4ISRnet.com posted a colorful piece about how the German radar company Hensoldt tracked a pair of F-35s that were departing the Berlin Air Show in 2018 with their “TwInivs” passive radar system . The article was well written and brings up the most glaring points regarding Hensoldt’s claims. Yet my inbox and DMs started filling up with readers showing great concern and amazement regarding what some are saying on social media is the “end of stealth” technology. They wanted to know what to think of all this. Well let’s start with this: no, passive radar doesn’t invalidate the need for stealth and stealth isn’t just about hiding from radar, it is about employing a broad cocktail or measures to drastically increase survivability via limiting the adversary’s ability to detect and target you. And guess, what? It isn’t a magical cloak of invisibility. It never has been and it never will be. And passive radar isn’t a magic stealth detection tool, either. At its most basic, the passive radar concept uses ambient RF radiation, such as emissions from cellphone towers, television and radio broadcasts, and more, instead of its own active radar emitter, and uses returns from those signals to detect targets moving through an area of the sky. The concept has been around for a long time. It dates back to the dawn of radar, with passive radars seeing service during World War II. Multiple weapons manufacturers in multiple countries have been pursuing the technology, to varying degrees, in recent decades. TwInivs passive radar system., Hensoldt In fact, it seems that every few years an article makes a big splash by declaring that stealth technology may be invalid due to passive radar system advances. Usually, these articles are packaged with the threat de jour—Iran, Russia, China, etc. Similar claims are now made in articles about low frequency and quantum radar technology today. Hensoldt’s own claims are over a year old and came at a time when Germany was looking at buying the F-35 to replace its Tornado fighters. But really, anything on this type of topic seems to spark a bit of misplaced hysteria, and when the F-35 is the subject of attention along with it, it is bound to grab eyeballs. As the years have progressed, passive radar has not slashed the utility of stealth technology for a laundry list of reasons. First off, just detecting something unknown in your vicinity does not mean that the target can be accurately classified or engaged. In other words, in most cases, passive radar does not provide engagement quality telemetry for which to employ weapons. It is an awareness tool largely used for cueing other, more traditional sensors. General concept behind TwInivs passive radar system., Hensoldt Hensoldt In other words, it could be used to direct other air defense sensors, such as search and fire control radars, toward an area of the sky that said object appears to be in. This is a worthy capability, as it is possible that some of those sensors will be able to get a better track on the aircraft, especially by varying tactics with the knowledge that they are looking for a low-observable target. But considering that stealth aircraft are optimized to evade detection specifically from the types of radar bands used by these radars, especially from certain aspects, just directing their beams to an area of sky may be a fruitless endeavor. This is especially true if said stealthy target is at a significant distance from those sensors and at a favorable aspect in relation to them. And even if tracking is realized, it would likely be intermittent and not long continuous enough to guide weapons onto the target. Also, once those sensors are cued by the passive radar system, the aircraft being hunted for will know full well that this is occurring and will employ route changes and advanced electronic warfare capabilities to confuse, spoof, or blind those radar systems. These active sensors give away their location by emitting, so the aircraft or other platforms it is networked to, could also elect to destroy some or all of those threatening sensors if they pose a dire threat to its mission or if the aircraft’s mission itself is to do so. So, once the passive radar does its job and cues other higher-fidelity active sensors onto the target area, those sensors are now at risk of being obliterated. Where the passive radar has an advantage, even over its active counterparts, is that it doesn’t emit radiation that can give away its location or even the fact that it is present in the region. That means it is very hard to hunt down and destroy. That is until it broadcasts information to other air defense nodes, such as to cue fire control and/or search radars, if it does so without being connected to them via a hard line. In most cases, if the passive radar was hard-wired to the other sensors, it would be in a fixed position or near those systems anyway, thus making it vulnerable to attack, too. The vulnerability of any integrated air defense node talking to another via radio emissions depends on what type of data-link and its associated hardware is being used. Regardless, it is something very important to consider. Passive radars also rely on dense third-party RF radiation to exploit a medium in which stealthy aircraft can be spotted. So, using it in highly remote areas would be problematic if not totally useless. In other words, because the radiation level cannot be controlled by its operators, the system is subject to the ambient RF environment it is placed in. This limits how and where the system can be effectively employed. Even then, their range and fidelity are limited. For instance, in the German passive radar story, the company says it tracked two F-35s flying, but at the time those F-35s had their transponders on and were talking on air traffic control frequencies (emitting their own RF energy). They may have even had their radars on utilizing basic modes. They were also flying with their radar reflectors attached to their fuselages and with their aircraft in a non-combat configuration and software mode. The operators also knew the local RF environment very well and how to optimize the system to spot aircraft that they already knew were going to be there. Even under these near ideal conditions, they claimed they tracked the aircraft for about 90 miles. That is a substantial distance, but is no way indicative of what ranges would be possible under actual combat conditions, and that’s even if they would see an unannounced, emissions silent, combat configured, electronic warfare-enabled F-35 at all. DoD Where passive radar systems may be most capable is when they are paired with an advanced infrared search and track system. This could allow for more precise secondary targeting of whatever the passive radar sees on its scope. It could also provide classification data and even weapons employment information. But IRSTs, especially those mounted on the ground, have major limitations themselves, especially in terms of range and fidelity, which can be highly environmental conditions-dependent, not to mention scanning speed. The ability to help direct fighters onto potential targets of interest that normal radars don’t see is another potentially potent application for such a system. But that means fighters need to be in the air or on alert nearby in order for such a concept to work. So, the point is that passive radars have their place in an advanced integrated air defenses system. But their capabilities are limited and largely supportive in nature. As computer processing continues to improve, their ability to pick out targets from the chaos of the electromagnetic spectrum in populated areas will improve and with it so will the IADS overall capabilities. Also, moving from bistatic passive radars configurations—like TwInivs—to multi-static systems with arrays distributed across large geographical areas should also provide more robust capabilities. Eventually, one could imagine the processing power and the complexity of these systems becoming so intricate they could get an infrared homing missile into the right area to possibly lock onto a stealthy aircraft. This would be something of a ‘holy grail’ of long-range, all passive, surface-to-air engagement where no active radar is used at all. Still, a data-link connection between the missile and the passive radar system would be needed. But the truth is that at this point the missiles that could support such an engagement are largely still in the concept stage or fielded in very limited numbers , and the passive radars capable of providing high-quality telemetry for them are largely an idea, not a reality. Also, aircraft like the F-35 have advanced missile approach warning systems that will still spot the missile heading their way and various forms of infrared countermeasures and even hard-kill systems can be employed. Above all else, this assumes a perfect scenario and one where there are plenty of RF emissions being pumped into a sky. One way to drastically degrade these systems’ effectiveness, no matter how advanced, is to strike the commercial RF transmitters that enable them. Often times this is the first step in an air campaign anyway. In fact, many of these systems stop broadcasting during a time of war anyway. So overall, passive radar is not a capability invalidates stealth. At least anytime soon, and likely no time in the foreseeable future, if ever. In fact, it makes stealth all that much more important as it allows aircraft to evade the radars that will be used to attack it if passive radar detects their presence. USAFE As I have stated many times over, stealth technology is not some monolithic ‘thing’ that makes airplanes disappear. It is a wide-ranging cocktail of measures, including airframe shaping, composite structures, radar-absorbent materials, low-probability of intercept radars and communications, infrared signature attenuation, enhanced situational awareness, high-quality intelligence, mission and route planning based on that intelligence, destruction and suppression of enemy air defenses, tailored tactics employment, munitions selection, and now more than ever before, electronic warfare . All of these elements and more are balanced against performance and mission goals. Even with the best of these elements employed in the best possible way, it does not mean an aircraft is invisible to radar, it means it is far less detectable over a given range and aspect to a particular threat sensor. And just because a stealthy aircraft can be briefly detected, doesn’t mean it can be successfully engaged. The F-35, above all other aircraft flying today, has had its traditional stealth technology backstopped with other capabilities, namely electronic warfare and enhanced situational awareness, to help ensure its survivability in many threatening scenarios it could experience in the years to come. And even today, no matter what the USAF brass proclaims in big public speeches, there are places the F-35 wouldn’t wander into without significantly degrading the enemy’s IADS fist. That’s what standoff munitions are for, which are also becoming enemy air defense network disruptors. You can read more about the F-35’s bag of guileful survival tricks in this recent exclusive of ours . Beyond the F-35, future combat aircraft will use very low-observable design concepts that allow it to attenuate RF energy over a far broader number of bands. This, along with advanced in radar-absorbing coatings and structures, will impact even the effectiveness of passive radar. Their self-defensive systems will be kinetic and laser-based, as well. Meaning if they do get detected, the missiles will have a hard time actually reaching their target and scoring a blow. So no, passive radar is not something that will end the need for stealth technology, including low-observable shaping, structures, and coatings on combat aircraft. It does, however, have the potential to be an increasingly important component within any highly networked advanced integrated air defense system. It’s just another facet of the ever-increasing realm of air combat and the measures and countermeasures that it leans upon. In the end, neither passive radar or stealth technology is magic. The truth is that the side with the best book of spells, not the single best spell, has the greatest chance of winning the air wars of the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 23, 2021",U.S. Warships Have This Seldom Discussed But Very Powerful Optical Targeting System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s most powerful surface combatants, the Arleigh Burke class destroyer and the Ticonderoga class cruiser , are widely understood to be highly advanced floating radar systems, with their powerful SPY-1 radars and Aegis Combat System taking center stage when it comes to providing targeting information and tactical situational awareness to the ship’s crew. The vessels’ AN/SLQ-32, and in some cases their AN/SLQ-59 electronic warfare suites also provide situational information and soft-kill defenses against marauding cruise missiles and more. Beyond that, the list of sensor systems on these ships is long and impressive, but one critical and highly flexible system remains widely unacknowledged even though it sits prominently above the bridges of these ships and those of the Coast Guard’s National Security Cutters—the Mark 20 Electro-Optical Sensor System (EOSS). The Mark 20, and its similar-looking Mark 46 progenitor—which was introduced to the fleet in 1993—have a very science-fiction-like appearance. Movies like Short Circuit or Wall-E may come to mind when looking at the turreted sensor system, with its rectangular appendages and big apertures. But beyond its intriguing looks, the system gives the ship it is attached to some very important capabilities. So much so that, frankly, it deserves more attention than it gets. Mk20 EOSS, L3Harris With this in mind, The War Zone reached out directly to the manufacturer of the system, L3Harris, to find out more about it and the exact role it plays on multi-billion dollar fighting ships. Here is that exchange: What components make up the Mk 20 EOSS? The Mk20 Mod 1 and the Electro-Optic Sighting Systems that precede it (Mk20 Mod0 and Mk46) include an “above deck” unit with visual and thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, stabilization system and shock isolation unit, and a “below deck unit” that contains the control, tracking, power supplies and interface to display and control stations. An info sheet on the legacy Mark 46 EOSS., Kollmorgen/public domain What does it do primarily and what does it do in a secondary capacity? The primary purpose of the system is to provide highly accurate targeting information to the ship’s gun weapon system. In many instances, the ship’s radar may make an initial detection of a potential threat, and the Mk20 is then cued to visually confirm the target, and provide precise range and position for gun engagement. The goal is first shot hit accuracy. Of course, sailors are quite creative and immediately recognize the Mk20’s excellent performance as a situational awareness and navigation aid. We have heard of crews using the Mk20 to visually investigate suspicious vessels, and help navigate through congested waters. The operators find the thermal imaging capability and resolution particularly useful in nighttime operations. USCGC Hamilton with its EOSS atop its bridge. , USCG How does it accomplish those functions? Can you provide some scenarios that showcase how it would be used? We feel the Mk20 is an essential element of the ship’s weapon system and overall situation awareness capabilities. We can share three general scenarios that rely upon the excellent range, resolution, and accuracy of the Mk20: surface action – gun engagement: in a busy sea-lane, the ship’s radar detects a potential hostile craft approaching. The contact is passed to the Mk20. The Mk20 rapidly slews to the radar cue, detects and initiates track on the hostile craft. Thermal and visual images are used in combination to verify the hostile intent of the approaching craft and the laser range finder is used to provide a highly precise range for gunfire control calculations. Confirmed hostile and having passed precise track data to the weapon system, the main deck gun engages the target. The Mk20 is then used to verify target damage and assess the need for further engagement. The crew visually detects a potential threat using the Mk20 in as a situation awareness, long-range imaging system. The Mk20 passes the contact to the radar through the ship’s combat system to initiate a radar track for prioritization and potential future engagement (this occasionally happens in congested waters where the radar operator may have some difficulty distinguishing among multiple radar contacts) Ships transit at night and without use of radar. The Mk20 is used to detect surface traffic, allowing the crew to plot a course for safe passage. The laser range finder is used to verify ships positions by accurately ranging on known landmarks (lighthouses, etc.). What can it see and how far away can it see and in what conditions? We are excited to see the new Mk20 Mod1 go to sea this year. It will provide a new, wider field of view with better resolution than the legacy systems. This enables detection and tracking of small targets in even higher seas and at night. As you can imagine, we are not able to share specific range of performance figures. But we can say that the intent is to be able to detect and track small targets beyond the range of the deck gun in most conditions. Author’s note: The Mark 45 five-inch gun system used on U.S. Navy cruisers and destroyers has a range of nearly 15 miles . EOSS seen mounted on the port bridge wing of the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chancellorsville. , USN Can you provide some sample videos of it in use? I am sorry to say we do not have any interesting videos to share – the customer typically classifies data coming from the ship. Where did this type of system come from and how has it evolved into its latest incarnation? The EOSS evolved from the critical need to accurately, visually verify targets prior to engagement by the Aegis combat system. From this rather simple problem and solution, the EOSS has evolved to include the latest sensor technologies to arrive at its current Mk20 Mod1 configuration. This new system is less than half the weight of prior systems, enabling installation on smaller surface combatants like LCS. All of the EOSS systems L3Harris provides meet the most stringent environmental qualifications including shock – the systems maintain boresight accuracy in the event the ship is attacked and hit. Mark 20 EOSS seen on its perch atop the bridge of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Note the non-lethal LRADs on the bridge wings as well., USN What is unique about the latest variant and what types of ships beyond U.S. destroyers and cruisers could it end up on? We’ve already talked about this new system being much lighter than prior versions and with higher resolution than prior systems. But we’ve also made it much more modular. It is now possible to replace the sensor units on the above deck unit while underway. This means that, for the first time, ships are able to deploy with spares allowing replacement of visual, thermal or laser range finder modules, eliminating the need to replace the entire unit with a crane from pier-side. Not only does this new capability improve the readiness of the fleet, but now the sparing and logistics training to maintain these systems around the world just became much less burdensome. Future plans for the system? What about incorporating it into distributed aperture systems for enhanced situational awareness? That is an excellent idea and one that, as you may imagine, we are not able to fully address here. But it is fair to say that systems like the Mk20 Mod1 that provide highly accurate real-time targeting data without giving away the ship’s position, is a key component of how we see L3Harris enabling Distributed Maritime Operations. Navyrecognition.com did a nice video on the Mark 20 Mod 1 that goes over just how miniaturized this new rendition of the system is and how it can tie into distributed aperture systems in the future: Are there any impressions or other interesting inside bits from the fleet you can share about the system? Ship’s crews quickly grow to rely on the Mk20 for all the reasons mentioned above. We’ve had former commanding officers of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers visit the company and relate experiences they’ve had with the Mk20. One former ship’s captain said that they used the Mk20 extensively for navigation every time they transited the Straits of Malacca because it was the only way they could be sure they were avoiding the many vessels transiting that busy and congested waterway safely. “It saved us more than once.” The Arleigh Burke class, now entering into its third evolutionary sub-class, was first to field the EOSS in 1993. The system has seen drastic improvements since then and is now too in its third iteration., USN Because of its low public profile, it may come as a surprise that America’s surface combatants have such a powerful electro-optical and infrared tool, but the Mark 20 makes too much sense not to exist, or for the concept not to have existed for decades. It also gives some explanation as to how these ship’s five-inch guns are so accurate, but just the capability it provides for situational awareness and intelligence gathering over the smaller IR/EO systems, like those installed on these vessels’ Mark 38 25mm and the Mark 15 Phalanx close-in gun systems, is notable. Visual target identification over long ranges using infrared and electro-optical systems has become a pressing requirement across the services . With the entire system now being miniaturized and made far lighter and more supportable in the form of the Mark 20 Mod 1, it’s likely that we will start seeing EOSS trickle down to other platforms, with the Littoral Combat Ship being the most logical. Most people may not even realize the EOSS is there because it is usually stowed with its optics facing rearward and down when not in use, giving it the appearance of just another communications or RF sensor system. In other words, it hides in plain sight: さっきwikipedia見て知ったんだけど、あたごの艦橋の上に乗っかってる光学照準システムもAWSのアップデートに合わせて従来のMk.46 OSSからMk.20 EOSSに変更されてるのね。 pic.twitter.com/EjpD5PfDKK — ふにに (@hunini181202) April 15, 2019 The EOSS’s ability to investigate targets visually over very long ranges could also become essential as distributed aperture systems (DAS) become more common on fighting ships . EOSS and a navalized DAS could operate in a similar manner as the DAS and EOTS on the F-35. Aided by AI, they could work together to become an incredible automated situational awareness enhancing tool for crews. It’s no secret that a better understanding of what is going on in the vicinity of the ship is badly needed within the U.S. Navy. Add a laser designator and EOSS could allow the ship’s gun rounds to become guided and/or facilitate the fielding small missile systems that can be easily added to ships in a modular manner. So, there you have it, the shy but very capable and important Electro-Optical Sensor System that acts as the high acuity eyes and deck gun targeter for America’s destroyers, cruisers, and National Security Cutters.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 29, 2019",Here’s Who Has Been Flying The F-117 Stealth Jets And Why According To The Air Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of effort, The War Zone has been making steady headway in obtaining new details about the status of the U.S. Air Force’s remaining F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jets and their future fates, including that one is headed for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Still, it has long proven difficult to get any details about who is still flying at least some of these jets and why, which has long been one of the hottest topics of interest regarding these aircraft. Now we can confirm that the Air Force Test Center has been operating some of the Nighthawks to help out with the service’s research and development efforts. How many of the 51 remaining F-117s out at the secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport are airworthy is “not for public release,” Air Force spokesperson Brian Brackens recently told The War Zone by Email. This is not necessarily surprising as the service often chooses not to disclose details about the availability rates for specific aircraft fleets or its overall force posture absent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. At the same time, it is hardly a secret that some Nighthawks are still flying despite a 2017 Congressional mandate to begin physically destroying the remaining examples. This same mandate rescinded a previous requirement for the Air Force to keep them all in what is known as “ Type 1000 ” storage, which would have allowed personnel to relatively quickly return the aircraft to service, if necessary. “On occasion, we [the Air Force] will fly certain aircraft to support limited research activities,” Brackens further explained to The War Zone . “Pilots from the Air Force Test Center” are behind the stick of the Nighthawks during those sorties, he added. Since the Air Force officially retired the F-117s in 2008, there has been a relatively steady flow of pictures and video showing at least some of the aircraft still flying. Spotters have seen them in around the Nellis Range complex , wherein the Tonopah Test Range and its associated airport sit. Area 51 is also shielded, in part, from prying eyes in part by the Nellis Range and the Department of Energy’s adjacent Nevada National Security Site . They’ve also caught audio from some of the jets flying around Area 51’s highly restricted airspace, also known as “The Box” or “Dreamland,” and watched them zoom over the Mojave Desert in Southern California. A map showing the Nellis Range complex, including the location of the Tonopah Test Range Airport, and other adjacent ranges., Finlay McWalter via Wikimedia In that same period, there has been much discussion and speculation about what these Nighthawks are actually doing. This has included claims that some of the Air Force, or some other government agency, did reactivate a number of the aircraft and deploy them for combat operations in the Middle East. There is no evidence, of this, as The War Zone has previously explored in-depth , and we have also offered an equally detailed alternative explanation . In addition, FOIA requests we sent to U.S. Central Command, Air Force Material Command, the Air Force Safety Center and Hill Air Force Base, all turned up no records touching on the possible regeneration of the Nighthawks for combat missions. It has always seemed more plausible that the Air Force, or even private contractors, would still be flying F-117s to support a variety of research and development and operational test and evaluation activities, relating to both other aircraft and ground-based systems. As The War Zone has pointed out on multiple occasions , the Nighthawk’s stealth and other capabilities, while still obscure to the public in many regards , are very much a known quantity within the Air Force. So, while it remains unclear exactly what work specifically the aircraft are supporting from time to time, there are ideal test assets for a wide variety of projects, such as developing new radars or radar-absorbing materials , testing new or improved sensors, or evaluating the signatures of new or existing stealthy materials against potential threats . The stealthy F-117s could also be valuable as aggressors . As we at The War Zone wrote earlier this year : “We know for a fact that testing of advanced IRST systems is deeply underway. The F-15C/D and Super Hornet Forces are slated to get these sensors en masse soon. America’s enemies also use the technology for passive detection of airborne targets, which is totally immune to a stealthy plane’s small radar signature. In fact, we know an F-16 that flies test support out of Groom Lake/Area-51 is outfitted with the same IRST sensor intended for the Super Hornets and the Eagles. That aircraft was also caught on camera very near where the F-117 was, but it was blasting through “Star Wars Canyon.” “The F-117 was designed specifically for reduced infrared signature. Its elaborate planar exhaust system spreads out and attenuates the jet’s twin GE-F404 engines’ thermal signature. This makes it a very attractive and challenging target for testing the abilities and limits of IRST sensors. “New modular Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar systems are also being tested for a number of tactical jets and bombers , and the F-16, in particular . So the low-level profile the F-117s were flying, the location of the flights, and the positioning relationship with the F-16s makes near perfect sense in regards to air-to-air sensor testing. “ There had already been compelling circumstantial evidence to support the idea that the F-117s that were still flying were doing so in a test or evaluation role. Notably, in July 2018, Youtube user ‘ pdgls ‘ uploaded an audio recording of radio chatter between a pair of Nighthawks and a KC-135R tanker, as well as controllers on the ground. The two jets flew orbits near Area 51 and appeared to be going through a variety of test points. You can read our full analysis of that event here . The confirmation that some of the F-117s are supporting “limited research activities” might help explain pictures that emerged earlier this year of one of the jets flying with what either appears to be some of its radar-absorbent skin removed or modified in some fashion. Of course, this could also be related to the demilitarization process , which the remaining aircraft, including those getting transferred to museums , are already beginning to go through. All this said, it remains curious how secretive the Air Force has been about the F-117s and their continued activities, despite the aircraft certainly not being camera shy. While we now that the Air Force Test Center (AFTC), headquartered at Edwards Air Force Base in California and previously known as the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), has been supplying pilots when necessary, it remains unclear who exactly “owns” the Nighthawks and is managing this extended twilight period of their service lives. The F-117s do not appear in the inventory of aircraft under the management of the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, which oversees the U.S. military’s principal aircraft boneyard . Adrian Harrison/@adrianh By every indication, the F-117s remain highly controlled assets under the purview of AFTC. Brackens, the Air Force spokesperson, said that responses to our queries have come by way a “program office” handling the aircraft. This is almost certainly an entity within AFTC, known as the Specialized Management Office, and sometimes abbreviated AFFTC/SMO, which is located at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Based on responses to our FOIA requests, after the official retirement of the Nighthawks in 2008, this office took ownership of all of the program records from Air Combat Command. Whether or not the airworthy F-117s are grouped together in a formal unit remains unclear. It is possible that they are simply attached to the detachments of the AFTC that are understood to manage operations at secretive facilities, including Tonopah and Area 51. Whatever the case, the Air Force has said it is now moving closer to begin finally destroying the remaining F-117s for good, with the exception of those that are headed for public display. Now that we were finally able to get some information on the current state of the F-117 force and its activities, hopefully, more details will become available about the second lease on life that at least some of the aircraft have been enjoying for a number of years now.

Recent events have highlighted the increasing strategic value of the Arctic as both Russia and the United States seek to expand their military footprints into the northernmost regions of both hemispheres. Yet it is abundantly clear that Russia is putting huge strategic importance on the Arctic, as evidenced from its many investments in the region , while the United States lags behind in terms of a permanent footprint above the Arctic Circle. That strategic value took center stage recently when President Donald Trump stated that his administration was considering attempting to purchase Greenland from Denmark . “It’s just something we’ve talked about,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal . “Denmark essentially owns [Greenland]. We’re very good allies with Denmark. We’ve protected Denmark like we protect large portions of the world, so the concept came up. Strategically, it’s interesting. And, we’d be interested. We’ll talk to them a little bit.” While Trump’s comments were widely lampooned in the international press and flat out rebuffed by the Danish government, the pipe dream of purchasing an autonomous region from an ally is in fact somewhat rooted in American and NATO military policy. For over 60 years, America has operated one of its most strategic military outposts in Greenland with the permission of the Danish government. The ramp at Thule Air Base. , USAF Russia, in particular, has been increasing its air and naval power in the Arctic Circle in recent years and has been establishing new bases along what is destined to become a new and highly strategic shipping route as the ice continues to melt. NATO allies such as Denmark, with strategic arctic access to the Arctic, have thus become key to America’s defenses in what seems to be a new Cold War brewing in the Earth’s highest latitudes. America’s northernmost military base, Thule Air Base, is key to the United States’ ability to provide early warning of an impending nuclear attack and serves as a major logistical hub in a very important, but remote region. Throughout its nearly 70-year history, the base has had many other roles and has faced its shares of challenges and near-disasters. Today, it remains just as inhospitable and vital as ever. An RCAF Hornet at Thule Air Base. , USAF Thule Air Base The United States began establishing military outposts and bases throughout Greenland after Danish Ambassador to the United States Henrik Kauffmanns made an agreement, on his own initiative and in defiance of the Danish government operating under Nazi occupation, in 1941 that authorized the United States to defend Danish settlements on Greenland from German forces. The Danish government attempted to evict the United States following World War II, but abandoned those attempts in 1949 when it joined NATO. Because Greenland and the Arctic regions offer short distances between North America and the Soviet Union, the Cold War saw U.S. Armed Forces turn to Greenland for the establishment of early warning outpost and a locale capable of executing nuclear strikes on Russia. In 1950 the Air Force began constructing Thule Air Base in secret under the project name Operation Blue Jay . The existence of the base finally was made public in late 1952. The installation initially featured a 10,000-foot runway, 125 barracks units, 6 mess halls, and the necessary infrastructure to support a population of thousands year-round. Other features included a hospital, power plant, and recreational facilities, including a bowling center, fitness center, and the “Top Of The World” club offering a restaurant, lounge, and ballroom. The base, which was originally operated by U.S. Air Force’s Strategic Air Command, had a multitude of missions throughout the Cold War, including supporting strategic bomber and reconnaissance operations aimed at the USSR. It even hosted interceptor jets, as well as Nike nuclear-armed surface-to-air missiles to protect it from potential attack and to swat down large formations of Soviet bombers heading to the United States would World War III have kicked off. 74th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron’s F-89s at Thule Air Base, Greenland, in 1955., USAF via Wikicommons Today, Thule Air Base remains the United States military’s northernmost outpost, located well above the Arctic Circle and just 947 miles from the North Pole. These days, nearly 600 USAF personnel, civilian contractors, Danes, and Greenlanders still call the base home. USAF personnel assigned to Thule are welcomed to “the top of the world” with an orientation document outlining the unique challenges of living in such a remote, inhospitable environment. Thule Air Base in 2005, Public domain USAF personnel at Thule face winter temperatures that drop to as low as -47 degrees Fahrenheit and include winds that can peak as high as 100 knots. The closest town to the Air Base is Qaanaaq, which is located 75 miles northwest of the base and boasts a population of about 600 permanent residents. One of the most unique and arguably misery-inducing features of Thule is the fact that the base experiences constant darkness from November through February, as well as constant sunlight from May to August. Thule Air Base includes a deepwater port and sprawling infrastructure., Google Earth Thule Air Base, Google Earth Emergency shelters are located at intervals along Thule’s network of roads, and a strict buddy system is used whenever personnel leave the base. During some storm conditions, personnel are restricted to the buildings in which they are located whenever the severe conditions are declared with no pedestrian or vehicle travel whatsoever. Frostbite, hidden pockets of water just below the snow, and snow blindness are everyday dangers faced by USAF personnel at Thule. The different storm conditions depicted in an orientation document for personnel arriving at the base., Pentagon document Thule Air Base plays host to a variety of operations, including those concerned with ballistic missile early warning and defense. Today, the Air Force’s 821st Air Base Group oversees operations at Thule. This unit is subordinate to the 21st Space Wing at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, which provides space surveillance, missile warning, and space control to North American Aerospace Defense Command and Air Force Space Command. Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, part of the 50th Space Wing’s global satellite control network, also calls Thule Air Base home and provides telemetry, tracking, and command and control operations to the United States and allied government satellite programs. The 821st Security Forces Squadron at Thule Air Base handles security of the 254 square-mile Thule Defense Area. That area includes a ballistic missile early warning system, satellite control and tracking facilities, the air base, and the seaport which is only accessible for a short period during the summer. The annual sealift operation to support the base during this period is called Operation Pace Goose. Thule also hosts the 12th Space Warning Squadron, responsible for the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System which is tasked with detecting and tracking ICBMs heading for North America. A secondary mission of the 12th SWS is providing space surveillance data on satellites and other near-Earth objects like asteroids to the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The facility at Thule that primarily supports all these space and missile warning missions is Site J, or J-Site. It’s a sprawling USAF radar station that sits on a bluff roughly six miles northeast of Thule Air Base and includes some of the most up-to-date and powerful missile warning and space object tracking systems on the planet, including Raytheon’s giant AN/FPS-120 Solid State Phased Array Radar. AN/FPS-120 a Thule’s J-Site., www.bcpowersys.com/ In the event of a missile launch threatening North America, the site will provide warnings and missile defense assessment data of incoming Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). It is fully networked into the ecosystem of space-based, sea-based, and ground-based sensors that provide Strategic Command, and thus the National Command Authority, with critical information regarding an impending nuclear attack . Because of this high-stakes role, the information the site provides can mean the difference between identifying a mistake or accidentally ending the world as we know it. J-Site., Google Earth In addition, Thule is the site of a number of flying operations, including Vigilant Shield , an annual, bi-national air defense training event staged with Canadian forces. Thule often offers support for surveillance missions, scientific data gathering flights , and as a hub for transports and search and rescue aircraft. Over the years, it has been speculated that the base is an ideal location to launch clandestine spy flights against Russian interests in the region. Thule did play a part in the SR-71 Blackbird’s history. Tanks were installed at Thule to hold the jet’s unique JP-7 fuel and tankers did operate from there to refuel Blackbird missions, but beyond that, and being a diversion field, it isn’t clear if the base ever hosted the Blackbird. Still, one would think for secretive flying assets, the remote and strategic location with ample hangar space and a tiny population would be an ideal place to deploy them from when the mission warrants it, especially in this age of new friction between the U.S. and Russia and the latter’s designs on the region. Because of its strategic value and early warning mission, Thule Air Base and its surrounding facilities will, unfortunately, be among the first military installations to be targeted in the event of a nuclear exchange. But the threat of nuclear annihilation isn’t the only danger Thule Air Base faces. Ghosts of The Cold War: Camp Century and Project Iceworm From 1959 until 1967, a secretive research facility known as Camp Century was established 150 miles east of Thule Air Base. A 1965 technical report produced by the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory states the facility’s official purpose was to “learn how to construct military facilities on the Greenland Ice Cap.” This was a feat which required significant research to find construction methods and materials which could survive the constantly-shifting conditions of glacial subsurface ice. In order to provide Camp Century with power, American engineers installed a nuclear reactor under the ice, a decision which the Danish government found problematic , to say the least. There were widespread fears that the reactor could contaminate the surrounding ice sheet, but the Danish government ultimately sided with NATO deterrence policies and allowed the United States to install the nuclear reactor – and to store nuclear weapons at Camp Century. Camp Century was known to the public, and Walter Cronkite even visited the site with CBS camera crews in 1961. However, it was also home to an infamous and bizarre research project known as Project Iceworm. According to a 2008 study published in the Scandanavian Journal of History , Project Iceworm involved plans to construct a system of tunnels 2,500 miles in length, which could be used to launch 600 “Iceman” missiles, modified two-stage Minuteman Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs), at the Soviet Union. While this a purpose was never disclosed to the Danish public, the study’s author claims that Project Iceworm was intended to be a cornerstone of NATO’s “second strike” nuclear weapons strategy: “According to the Army study the concept would take advantage from the remoteness of Northern Greenland, its relative closeness to Soviet targets, the ‘unique adaptability of the Icecap to nuclear deployment’, and the proximity to Thule. The key concept was to deploy the missile force in ‘thousands of miles of cut-and-cover tunnels’, or rather covered trenches, whose floor would lie 28 feet beneath the surface. The missiles would be placed some four miles apart and controlled by a total of 60 hardened Launch Control Centers (LCCs) dispersed under the ice surface. In its launch position the warhead of the Iceman would be about 3 feet beneath the surface and able to withstand an overpressure of at least 30 psi. The whole system should be launchable in 20 to 60 minutes depending on circumstances and would be relatively invulnerable ‘except to a massive Soviet thermonuclear attack’, which was not deemed likely.” Ultimately, both Camp Century and Project Iceworm were plagued with issues stemming from the fact that the Greenland ice sheet is constantly shifting. Army engineers determined that keeping thousands of miles of ice tunnels from collapsing was too great a technical challenge and cost. Project Iceworm and Camp Century were abandoned in 1966 before the nuclear launch tunnels were ever operational, but their legacies still haunt Greenland today. In 2016, scientists observed that rapidly melting sea ice could soon expose the buried weapons , sewage, fuel, and pollutants at Camp Century within the next 90 years. The thawing camp has been estimated to contain hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, wastewater, radioactive coolants, and toxic organic compounds such as PCBs . These were buried in the ice along with the camp under the assumption that the ice sheet would permanently house them, but climate change is now threatening to unearth these pollutants. Greenland, which secured home rule from Denmark in 1979 and has been increasingly more autonomous following the passage of the Self-Government Act in 2008, has unsuccessfully attempted to compel the U.S. government to clean up the abandoned outpost, but so far the base remains a contentious diplomatic issue. In 2017, the Pentagon issued a statement saying it “acknowledges the reality of climate change and the risk it poses” and will “work with the Danish government and the Greenland authorities to settle questions of mutual security.” 1968 B-52 Crash and Project Crested Ice Aside from housing a ticking environmental time bomb, Thule Air Base is also the site of one of America’s worst nuclear accidents, the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. On January 21, 1968, a cabin fire broke out in B-52G “HOBO 28,” a USAF bomber carrying four B28FI thermonuclear gravity bombs. The cause of the fire remains unknown. Six of the seven crew members were able to successfully eject, but the seventh was killed while abandoning the aircraft. The B-52 subsequently crashed onto sea ice in North Star Bay just west of Thule Air Base. SSgt Calvin Snapp being rescued after ejecting onto the Greenland ice sheet., Public domain Reports vary, but it is believed at least three of the B-52’s weapons exploded on impact, showering the surrounding area with radioactive materials. While nuclear detonations were not triggered, the conventional high explosives did, creating a swath of fallout similar to the effects of a dirty bomb. The burning fuel and explosives melted the ice sheet, allowing much of the debris to settle to the ocean floor. The USAF quickly launched Project Crested Ice to cleanup the nuclear mess, an effort which required the collection of thousands of pieces of debris from the ice sheet and ocean floor as well as over 500 million gallons of ice water. Hundreds of USAF personnel worked for eight months in subzero temperatures to recover radioactive materials which were then shipped to South Carolina for safe disposal. USAF documents confirm that at least 29 service members were contaminated, but a 2001 USAF evaluation of Project Crested Ice states that the highest readings in samples from contaminated personnel “were well below the annual limit of intake.” DTIC.mil While the clean up was deemed a success by the USAF, documents obtained by the BBC through the Freedom of Information Act suggest that at least one of the thermonuclear weapons may have been unaccounted for following Project Crested Ice. At the time, the Pentagon refused to comment on the alleged lost weapon. A subsequent study from the state-financed Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) disputed the BBC report , saying the documents referred to a search for a part of the fissile core of one of the bombs, not a missing bomb itself. Thule’s Lasting Strategic Importance NATO continues to cite the Arctic as a region of “great power competition” as Russia vies for control of strategic locations and undersea natural resources. Russia has been preparing for war in the Arctic for years, and despite its foothold at Thule Air Base, the United States is still playing catch-up. As of 2016, Russia has over 50 airfields and ports in the area, assets which may enable it to deny the United States access to the Arctic. The Russians also operate a remarkably large fleet of icebreakers across the country’s Navy and other agencies, which ensure it has access to these same areas. China is also expanding its presence in the Arctic , prompting the Department of Defense to define the Arctic as “ an increasingly competitive domain .” Earlier this year, the Pentagon warned Congress of China’s high interest in the Arctic , including Greenland, and the country’s potential to cooperate with Russia on the strategic issue. “Though Russia and China would be natural competitors for Arctic resources and influence, they have started cooperation knowing that only together they can outcompete the West,” said Agnia Grigas , an energy expert in Washington, D.C. “China’s need for energy sources and Russia’s economic dependence on fossil fuel exports depends on this.” As the Arctic sea ice continues to melt, the world’s superpowers are racing to establish permanent footholds in the Arctic not only for military strategy but for economic development. In 2017, the Center for Contemporary Conflict wrote that there is “tremendous potential for maritime commerce” in the Arctic including oil drilling in the North Sea and the mining of rare earth metals from the sea floor. The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long lowers equipment to the Arctic ice., Public domain China is already investing billions in energy extraction and minerals prospecting throughout Greenland and Siberia, and more Chinese ships are using the Northern Sea Route for commerce. Ex-NATO commander Philip Breedlove has mentioned in interviews that melting Arctic sea ice will open up new lanes for commercial shipping and maritime traffic between Asian markets and Europe and North America, meaning whichever superpower controls these lanes will be able to dictate the terms of international trade in the Arctic. As the Arctic heats up both literally and geopolitically, Thule could become a cornerstone of America’s military strategy in what is a looming military competition in the northernmost corner of the world. Thule Air Base’s geographic location provides the United States with unparalleled access to the Arctic, and its missile detection and tracking capabilities make it one of the most strategically important sites the Air Force operates. If the U.S. wants to compete with Russia in the Arctic, Thule is likely to become a key linchpin of that strategy. Having a major installation to stage logistics out of that can then be pushed farther north will be absolutely essential in itself, as well as a place for forward-based command and control capabilities and other activities, beyond all the other support and surveillance functions the base currently provides. A view from the street during snowfall at Thule Air Base., USAF This could mean that one day Thule Air Base ends up reverting back to regularly supporting strategic bomber operations—a possibility that seems even more likely as of late —and hosting a permanent cadre of fighters for its protection. Outfitting the sprawling base with static anti-aircraft and anti-ballistic missile defenses is another real possibility as tensions between the U.S., its NATO allies, and Russia continues to rise throughout the region in the coming years. The fact that the base appears to be largely defenseless at this time is quite concerning, to be honest. With all this in mind, cooperation with the Danish government remains more imperative than ever in order to keep this site in America’s strategic portfolio, but the threat of climate change and the possibility of shifting international relationships means that this isn’t necessarily guaranteed.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 18, 2024",SPEAR Mini-Cruise Missile Getting An Electronic Warfare Variant To Swarm With Is A Huge Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s becoming increasingly clear that the age of highly networked air-launched munitions that can swarm together and work as a team is rapidly approaching. This is not just about big cruise missiles. Even the most diminutive of smart weapons could be adapted to become part of an undulating, rapid-reacting, network of disparate munitions that work cooperatively to accomplish a set of goals and directives. MBDA’s Select Precision Effects At Range Capability Three (SPEAR-3) mini-cruise missile, a weapon that itself was adapted from the Brimstone short-range air-to-ground missile, is now getting an electronic warfare variant that will work alongside its traditional brethren to shatter enemy air defenses and to protect launching aircraft, and even other missiles, from their deadly reach. MBDA’s SPEAR-3 is a standoff precision-guided munition that uses some of the same components found in the company’s successful Brimstone short-range air-to-ground missile. Adding a pair of pop-out wings and a small turbojet engine, SPEAR-3 is able to fly an estimated 85 miles to prosecute smaller targets, including those on the move, in any weather, day or night. It does this via leveraging a tri-mode seeker capable of radar, infrared, and laser homing. The missile is capable of autonomously picking out targets once it flies to the target area, or the target can be data-linked to the missile via the launch platform’s sensors or from third party sensor information the aircraft receives from its own data links. The missile can also strike a target via laser guidance, whether that be from a party of the ground nearby or an aircraft overhead the target area. The American GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb II, better known as Stormbreaker, uses a very similar tri-mode terminal guidance package and also includes GPS, inertial navigation, and a data-link system for midcourse guidance, just like SPEAR-3. So, overall the two weapons are similar in many respects, but SPEAR-3 has nearly double the range and can reach its targets faster than the unpowered Stormbreaker glide bomb. Weight and dimensions wise, they are similar, as well. It isn’t clear if Stormbreaker’s 105lb warhead is substantially larger than SPEAR-3’s. One would assume this would be the case as SPEAR-3 has to accommodate an engine and fuel, while Stormbreaker does not. If the warhead from Brimstone is carried over, it is substantially smaller than the one found on Stormbreaker, but it’s still very capable of blasting through heavy armor and taking down small fortified structures, as well as softer targets. Just with its standard capability set, SPEAR-3 is one potent missile that will benefit 4th generation and 5th generation fighters alike. The F-35 is slated to be able to carry four in each of its bays while still retaining room for a Meteor air-to-air missile in each bay, as well. 4th generation tactical fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon will be able to carry three to a rack externally. The recent announcement from MBDA that they will be developing an electronic warfare variant of their mini cruise-missile of sorts alongside their partner’s Leonardo is not only highly logical, it also has the potential to drastically increase the tactics set, survivability, and capabilities of the baseline SPEAR-3 itself. Named SPEAR-EW, this adaptation will work as a jammer and decoy missile to distract, blind, and spoof enemy air defense systems in a similar manner as America’s Miniature Air-Launched Decoy-J/X (MALD-J/X), but with more of a tactical focus due to its far shorter range, and with a more distinct goal of working with its kinetic (high-explosive-armed) cousins directly. Joseph Trevithick SPEAR-EW could be used to help protect friendly fighters moving through a threat corridor by executing electronic attacks on threaten emitters or to assist fighters acting in the Wild Weasel role to get close enough to destroy air defenses directly with shorter-ranged munitions. But where they could really shine, is when they are used in concert with conventional SPEAR-3 missiles in the cooperative destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD) role. By pairing SPEAR-3s with SPEAR-EWs in a fully networked fashion, the mini-cruise missiles can work as a swarm to shatter critical parts of the enemy’s air defense network. For instance, SPEAR-EW could spoof or jam an enemy threat emitter while SPEAR-3s search for and destroy not just the emitter, but all the components of the SAM site arranged nearby. F-35B packing four spears and a Meteor in each bay. , MBDA SPEAR-EW could also provide electronic warfare screening on the fly for SPEAR-3s that are trying to make their way to a set of targets between the launch aircraft and the surface threat or threats. By detecting a pop-up threat on its own or via data-link from the launch aircraft, SPEAR-EW could act in real-time to suppress the threat so that the rest of the horde of missiles can make it to their target areas safely. Maybe most importantly, because SPEAR-EW is powered by a small Pratt & Whitney TJ-130 turbojet engine, it can throttle back and loiter over an area for an extended period of time while using its electronic bag of tricks to disrupt nearby air defenses. In fact, it could even be launched preemptively into an area where road-mobile SAM systems are feared to be lurking, hopping into action the moment one of them rears its ugly head—or in this case its radio frequency emissions, to be exact. It’s also quite possible that SPEAR-EW could be used kinetically even in just a hit-to-kill manner. Punching a hole in a threatening radar dish equals a mission kill. No explosive warhead is needed if it can home in directly on the radar emissions source or if it has GPS coordinates of that source data-linked to it by a third-party aircraft, such as the fighter that launched it. In other words, once its jamming job is done, it may be able to make a kill run at the emitter it was targeting. That is if a standard SPEAR-3 isn’t retargeted in real-time via the data-link network to kill the emitter first. In fact, SPEAR-EW could possibly be programmed to request the retargeting of the SPEAR-3 autonomously depending on the nature of the threat and the commands it has to work off of from the launching aircraft. It’s also possible that SPEAR-EW may retain SPEAR-3’s warhead. If that is the case, it could be used as a suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) weapon, prosecuting kinetic strikes on threat emitters as requested in lieu or in addition to jamming them. Brimstone missiles, which shares some components with the SPEAR-3, on a triple rack. MBDA has developed a similar triple rack for SPEAR-3., Joseph Trevithick For highly defended targets, where advanced short-range air defenses (SHORADs) are present, such as the Russian-made Pantsir S1 point defense system, SPEAR-EW could be an absolutely critical component of any standoff attack. Advanced SHORADs have the capability to not only take down aircraft, but also the weapons they fire and even the bombs they drop. This is in addition to larger cruise missiles and drones. Spear-EW could provide essential electronic warfare support to an approaching wave of SPEAR-3s or even larger cruise missiles, such as Stormshadows, jamming those SHORAD systems so that they don’t shred the attacking munitions during their terminal phases of flight. At the very least, they could make it possible for SPEAR-3s to destroy the SHORADs before the heavier munitions or aircraft arrive over the target area. The idea that you could do all this while not expending higher-end, heavier, standoff decoy-jammers, and do so en masse from tactical fighters—even stealthy ones with tight weapons bays—is a big plus. There is also a naval component to discuss. SPEAR-3s could be incredibly effective anti-ship missiles, especially for taking on swarms of smaller vessels operating in the littorals. Even against larger ships, a dozen SPEAR-3s blasting holes in a vessel’s sensors and superstructure would likely result in a mission kill, or at least leave that vessel vulnerable to attack from heavier weaponry, such as anti-ship cruise missiles. Having escort jammers in the form of SPEAR-EWs flying with SPEAR-3s in a cooperative swarm would be a very nasty and hard to defend against threat for an enemy flotilla to content with. Leonardo has been a real mover in expendable, active, electronic-warfare enabled countermeasures space. The company’s Britecloud expendable active decoy is cutting-edge in its abilities and concept of deployment and operation. Some of that same technology will likely be ported over to SPEAR-EW. MBDA’s press release is blatantly clear that they see the mix of EW and traditional strike SPEAR-3s working together will have intensely synergistic impacts on the battlefield, with the two capabilities combined being far greater than the sum of their parts. They also make indirect note that SPEAR-3, with its longer-range, faster flight time, and loitering ability, is superior to its glide-bomb competitors: Defence Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: “These state-of-the-art electronic jammers will confuse our adversaries and keep our pilots safer than ever in the air. Paired with the devastating power of precision Brimstone and Meteor missiles, our world-class F-35 and Typhoon jets will continue to rule the skies in the years to come.” Mike Mew, MBDA UK Director of Sales and Business Development, said: “SPEAR-EW is a revolutionary new capability that, alongside the existing SPEAR3 weapon, marks a fundamental change in the ability of friendly air forces to conduct their missions despite the presence of enemy air defences. Our vision for SPEAR is to create a swarm of networked weapons able to saturate and neutralise the most sophisticated air defences.  Adding SPEAR-EW to the family alongside our existing SPEAR strike missile demonstrates the principle of introducing complementary variants to the SPEAR family that will add significant capability and force multiplication without the need to repeat the platform integration.  We have an exciting roadmap of variants, spirals and technology insertions in the pipeline to further enhance the family as we move forward.” The core of SPEAR-EW’s payload is Leonardo’s advanced, miniaturised Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) technology, which offers the most advanced and future-proof electronic jamming and deception available on the market today. The new SPEAR-EW will complement the SPEAR network enabled miniature cruise missile, which is designed to precisely engage long range, mobile, fleeting and re-locatable targets in all weathers, day or night, in the presence of countermeasures, obscurants and camouflage, while ensuring a safe stand-off range between the aircraft and enemy air defences. Powered by a turbojet engine the SPEAR missile offers over double the range, and a far more flexible operating envelope, when compared to a conventional glide weapon. SPEAR-EW utilises this long endurance through its capacity to be launched at enhanced stand-off ranges and loiter while carrying out its jamming mission. Networking between swarms of munitions, not just the manned aircraft or drones that launch them, is emerging as a focus of future air combat. The USAF has very high hopes for their ambitious Golden Horde initiative and other branches, such as the U.S. Army, are also pushing hard to eventual provide enhanced networking across smart munitions and various platforms in the battlespace. SPEAR-3 rendering, MBDA SPEAR and SPEAR-EW represent a truly exciting combined capability that can change the way tactical aircraft prosecute their missions over the battlefield. Although some will underline how they give fourth generation fighters a much-needed boost in survivability, the payoffs are also potentially very big for the F-35, which will receive SPEAR-3 capability as part of its upcoming Block IV upgrade. Although it is hard to spot by some radars, the F-35 has retained key countermeasure systems found on 4th generation fighters, such as fiber-optic towed decoys and soon it will also have the ability to launch chaff countermeasures . Being able to fire off a standoff jamming missile, whether to help its launch platform survive or to help other munitions get to their targets, is a huge edge that could really make the Joint Strike Fighter much more lethal and wile. Even firing one off as the F-35 exfiltrates from enemy territory, where its less stealthy rear would be exposed to enemy radars, could be a tactic that means the difference between life and death. The SPEAR-EW could loiter and draw threat radars and even enemy missiles away from the F-35 as it accelerates to safety. MBDA The combo could also be remarkably devastating if adapted for American heavy bombers. One can imagine B-2 or B-21 carrying hundreds of these weapons at a time, raining them down on entire enemy formations and air defense nodes from a relatively safe distance. And like the F-35, having a few SPEAR-EWs onboard to use defensively when needed to solve a tactical problem or plug an intermittent vulnerability gap could be incredibly useful for American bomber crews. There are other critical applications as well. Equipping increasingly vulnerable attack helicopters with SPEAR-EW—a missile that could be carried on their stub-wing pylons—would be highly advantageous as it can help protect the helicopters from the same roving SHORAD systems mentioned earlier. Regardless, MBDA is really onto something here. If they can execute the networking development successfully and offer these missiles at a price that is somewhat relevant, the SPEAR family could be the ideal tactical swarming standoff weapon concept that blazes a trail into the realm of swarming munitions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed’s A-12 Oxcart spy plane, which the company developed for the Central Intelligence Agency, was a direct response to the growing vulnerability of its earlier U-2 Dragon Lady to hostile air defense networks. As such, the plane – the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force’s iconic SR-71 Blackbird – was extremely high- and fast-flying, but also incorporated then-state-of-the-art features to reduce its radar cross-section . These included a combination of a stealthy overall shape and radar-evading structures, as well as the use of composites in its construction, and the incorporation of radar absorbing materials on its skin. A far less known, but still a key component of the Skunk Works plan to make the A-12 harder to spot on radar involved a cesium-laced fuel additive to dramatically reduce the radar signature of the plane’s massive engine exhausts and afterburner plumes by creating an ionizing cloud behind the aircraft to help conceal its entire rear aspect from radar waves. Even before the U-2 had become operational in 1956, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had begun exploring potential successor designs . The next year, Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI), a CIA front, began laying out requirements for the new spy plane, including a need for a reduced radar signature. By 1958, proposals from Lockheed and Convair had emerged as the most feasible and the former firm’s concept showed more promise when it came to what we would consider today to be stealthy features. “From this period [the late 1950s], our studies regarding radar cross-section showed that any flyable aircraft to be operational in the period after 1963 could not avoid radar detection,” Clarence “Kelly” Johnson, famed Lockheed engineer and head of the company’s Advanced Development Programs (ADP) division, or Skunk Works, wrote in a now-declassified official internal history of the A-12 program in 1968. “This did not mean that we had not gone all out on the reduction of radar cross section, as we made many very important contributions, including those of basic shape, to the whole problem on the A-12.” An early A-12 Oxcart during flight testing., CIA After the CIA chose Lockheed to develop what would become the A-12 in 1959, the company continued to refine its radar-defeating features. The overall planform was designed to deflect radar waves, but there were a number of other physical additions to help improve its radar signature. These included spiked cones to shield the face of the inlets for the plane’s two massive Pratt and Whitney J58 engines, chines on the outside of the engine nacelles and engine ducts, curved extensions on the leading edges of the wings, and specially canted rear vertical stabilizers. Below the surface of its chined leading edges, radar defeating saw-tooth baffles also helped deaden the aircraft’s radar returns. A look at the various physical “anti-radar” features found the A-12 from the CIA’s own now-declassified history of the U-2 and Oxcart programs., CIA With the exception of the inlet spikes, these added features made heavy use of composite, radar-absorbing materials . Lockheed also developed a special “iron paint,” sometimes referred to as the “iron ball paint” because the mixture contained tiny iron balls, to help absorb radar waves. The special blend, which was also applied to the SR-71, reportedly cost $400 per quart in the 1960s. These features all had a notable impact on reducing the aircraft’s radar cross-section. However, there was one aspect of the plane’s radar signature that still proved difficult to manage, the exhaust outlets for the J58s and the giant plume from the engines at full afterburner, which was necessary to propel the A-12 to its blistering top speed of well over Mach 3. “To overcome the afterburner problem of a large radar cross section return from the aft quadrant, we proposed the use of [a] cesium additive to the fuel,” Kelly Johnson wrote in his A-12 history. “This was first brought up by Mr. Ed Lovick of ADP and its final development was passed over to P&W. It was eventually a basic part of our cross section reduction methods.” “The exhaust pipes were sixty inches in diameter, so they returned large amounts of energy at all frequencies of interest and over large angles to the rear,” Lovick, who also worked on the SR-71 and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat aircraft, wrote in his own book, Radar Man : A Personal History of Stealth . “We knew that the only way to prevent such echoes was, in effect, to close the apertures.” A J58 during a ground test., CIA Another J58 engine running on a test stand with its afterburner engaged., NASA Lockheed initially experimented with various metallic mesh screens, but quickly abandoned those efforts, according to Lovick. He says that Dr. Richard Bissell, the CIA’s Special Assistant for Planning and Coordination, who was managing the program, was so worried about this particular issue, he had considered calling for the scrapping of the entire development of a U-2 successor. That’s where the cesium additive, which eventually became known as A-50, came in an idea that Lovick claims saved the A-12 program. The basic principle behind this is a concept known as “ plasma stealth .” In the simplest terms, this involves creating a cloud of plasma, or ionized gas, around some or all of an object. The plasma then absorbs electromagnetic radiation, such as radar waves, preventing them from reflecting back. There are multiple ways to generate the required plasma Lovick’s idea was to inject an alkali metal, via a fuel additive, into the extremely hot exhaust streams, where the heat would turn it into an ionized gas. A breakdown of the radar cross-section reducing goals and the efforts Lockheed was undertaking to meet them with regards to the A-12 from a now-declassified company report ., Lockheed via USAF Lockheed tested mixtures using sodium, potassium, and cesium. “Cesium seemed to be the material of choice because in the gaseous state it is the most easily ionized,” Lovick wrote in his book. The final additive mix was 30 percent cesium metal and 60 percent dialkyl phosphate, according to Lovick. However, he says in his book that the testing of the additives, which included flight tests at Area 51, was finished by 1965, but it’s unclear if this only refers to Lockheed’s portion of the work before the project passed to Pratt & Whitney. In 1965, Pratt & Whitney had informed the CIA that it was looking into a new “carrier fluid” for the cesium in A-50, assumed to be dialkyl phosphate, because of a supply chain problem. The company had been purchasing the base solution from sources in the detergent industry, which were generating it as a byproduct of their own production processes. New U.S. government regulations had subsequently forced changes in detergent production that eliminated this byproduct. So, it’s unclear if the composition of A-50 subsequently changed or if Pratt & Whitney just identified a new source of dialkyl phosphate in the end. A note about A-50 production from a 1965 CIA memo regarding the A-12., CIA This raises separate questions about the toxicity of the A-50 additive. Though there is no indication that A-50 used a radioactive cesium isotope, the compound is toxic and it’s unclear how hazardous the complete mixture may have been, before or after being burned up in the J58s, especially given that its primary component was a detergent byproduct. At the same time, jet fuels are themselves generally toxic, to begin with, and the special fuel that the A-12s ran on was certainly no exception. It’s also not clear from the available records how much A-50 was necessary per gallon of JP-7 jet fuel to create the desired effect. The J58s on the A-12s, as well as the SR-71s, needed JP-7, which has a very low volatility and high flash point, because of the unusual combination of extremely high internal temperatures and very low external temperatures the planes experienced during high-altitude supersonic flight. The development of the A-12, in general, where almost every step was a cutting-edge engineering feat, suffered numerous delays and, despite a first flight in 1962, it did not fly an operational mission until 1967. Between 1967 and 1968, A-12s flew 26 sorties over North Vietnam and an additional three over North Korea as part of Operation Black Shield . It’s hard to tell definitively whether or not A-12s used JP-7 mixed with A-50 on any of those flights. The CIA wanted to use it on at least one Black Shield mission, referred to as BX6725 , on Oct. 4, 1967, which included grabbing imagery of Chinese military facilities on Hainan Island as the aircraft exited North Vietnam into the South China Sea. At least one other mission, BX6727 , followed similar tracks that offered an opportunity to collect imagery on Chinese targets. A low-quality scan of the map of the approximate tracks for Black Shield mission BX 6725. Hainan Island is not visible, except for the name, but lies just to the northeast of where the routes began and ended in the South China Sea, to the right., CIA However, none of the post-mission reports clearly state that the A-12s on either of these missions, or any others, used A-50. Available records also make clear that standard JP-7 did not have the cesium mixture and that personnel would only have added it when authorized to do so for a specific mission. It’s not entirely clear why, with the reported effectiveness of the mixture, the CIA would have declined to actually employ operationally in the end. North Vietnamese air defenses, some of the densest in the world at the time, attempted to engage the A-12s during each sortie. On one flight on Oct. 30, 1967, they fired at least six Soviet-made SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missiles—the same missiles that had shot down Gary Powers’ U-2 over the Soviet Union in 1960—at an Oxcart with CIA pilot Dennis Sullivan at the controls. The pictures he took during that flight caught the contrails of the missiles heading toward his aircraft, according to an official CIA history . He saw at least three of them detonate near him and a post-flight inspection found a fragment of one of the missiles embedded in the A-12’s fuselage. So, there was certainly a threat. Years before Black Shield, the CIA had also worked to assess the capabilities of advanced Soviet radars as part of programs codenamed Melody and Palladium . These projects involved complex efforts to generate false radar returns and then monitor Soviet reactions, thereby gauging what they could and could not “see” on their radar screens. As such, the Agency would have had at least some sense of how vulnerable the A-12s would be to detection in spite of their stealthy features. A Soviet P-14 Tall King radar, the appearance of which had prompted the CIA to begin looking into reducing the radar cross-section of the U-2, as well as its successor, in the first place., ShinePhantom via Wikimedia Given that the A-12’s speed and its electronic warfare package seemed sufficient to protect it over North Vietnam, the CIA may have continued to withhold use of A-50 for operational security reasons. Using it could have exposed its existence and given the Soviets and their allies time to develop countermeasures, rendering it less effective when it might have been absolutely necessary. Not using it outside of an emergency situation where planners deemed to be absolutely critical to a mission’s success may have also been a product of the additive’s impacts on the J58 engines. Typically, jet aircraft try to avoid ingesting particulate matter, especially alkali metals that could melt and fuze to internal components, which generally lead to extensive maintenance or potentially catastrophic accidents in flight. Beyond that, adding additional chemical components to the already highly sensitive JP-7 mixture could have had impacts on the fuel’s performance. A CIA memorandum from 1964 offers evidence of some of these issues in noting that A-12s required a modification to their fuel systems so that pilots could increase the flow when using fuel mixed with A-50. A separate message regarding BX 6725 also specifically notes concerns about degraded engine life due to protracted use of A-50-laced JP-7, saying that “all operational considerations have been applied to reduce additive burning to a minimum.” The bigger issue at the end of the day may simply have been the Air Force’s concerns about flying KC-135A tankers with loads of JP-7 mixed with A-50. Standard Black Shield missions involved A-12s launching from Kadena Air Base in Japan, then immediately linking up with one of the tankers. The spy planes would then fly their mission and link up with a tanker again, typically over Thailand, before heading back to base. A KC-135Q refuels an SR-71, the successor to the A-12., USAF If the A-12 arrived at the refueling point late, or there was some other issue with the rendezvous, the KC-135As ran the risk of having to burn the JP-7 in order to stay aloft or make it back to base themselves. The tankers could have used the JP-7 in an emergency, but doing so required a complete purge of the tanker’s fuel system and J57 engines afterward. Concerns about JP-7 mixing with the conventional jet fuel the KC-135s use to power their own engines during missions eventually led the Air Force to convert 56 of the aircraft in into the KC-135Q configuration between 1966 and 1968. These aircraft were specifically set aside to support SR-71 operations and featured body tanks that were completely isolated from the rest of the plane’s fuel system to ensure everything stayed separate. The A-50 additive would have only compounded these issues, though Lockheed’s Lovick said in his book that the company actually conducted the initial tests of the additive effects using a J57. The pre-planning message regarding BX 6725 also suggests that, somewhere along the line, studies had shown tankers could safely burn A-50 in emergencies. An excerpt from the BX 6725 mission planning message talking about issues relating to A-50., CIA The Air Force seems to have been unconvinced. “Tankers almost forced to burn A-50 if there is a delay by receiver,” a message dated September 1967 concerning Black Shield operations states. “A-50 still a major logistical problem but understand the reasoning behind at least giving it a try,” the missive continued. “SAC [Strategic Air Command] still not authorizing use except in emergency.” A mention of issues related to A-50 use from a September 1967 CIA message., CIA Whatever the case, A-50 appears to have at least remained available for use throughout Operation Black Shield. What happened to any remaining stockpiles of the additive after the A-12 program came to a close in 1968 is unclear. Though there’s no evidence they ever did, there’s no reason the SR-71 would not have been able to use it, if necessary, with the same potential impacts on engine life and performance. The segregated fuel system on the KC-135Q tankers, which the Air Force eventually re-engined with CFM56s to create the KC-135T variant, would have largely eliminated the concerns about the additive finding its way into the tanker’s engines for any reason. KC-10 Extenders , which also supported the Blackbirds later in their service life, also had the ability to keep the JP-7 separated from the aircraft’s own fuel load. A KC-10 refuels an SR-71., USAF In addition, even though the SR-71 featured improved electronic warfare capabilities and never overflew the Soviet Union, it still operated in areas where there were very real threats from enemy air defenses. Blackbirds also flew over North Vietnam, for instance, and certainly flew missions around the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies, which carried distinct risks . A recently declassified picture of an SR-71 experiencing an in-flight emergency in Swedish airspace during a mission near the Soviet Union in 1987., Forsvarsmakten SR-71s also flew missions over Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, and Syria around the Yom Kippur War in 1973, areas again with heavy, potentially hostile air defenses. Flights around North Korea, including near the Demilitarized Zone that bisects the Korean Peninsula, were risky, too, with the North Koreans attempting to shoot down one of the Blackbirds on at least one occasion in 1981. One of the Blackbirds also flew a mission over Libya to conduct bomb damage assessments following U.S. airstrikes on that country in 1986 during Operation El Dorado Canyon . There were also flights in the Persian Gulf targeting Iran during the 1980s , as well as routine flights over Cuba . Additional missions reportedly occured over or near The Falklands , Nicaragua , and South Africa . The aircraft could have been called upon to conduct other riskier missions if an actual large-scale conflict had broken out between the United States and a major adversary, such as the Soviet Union. Work related to plasma stealth, as a general concept, certainly continued in the decades after A-12 operations ceased, both in the United States and the Soviet Union. The extent to which this included research and development on creating these ionized clouds via chemical additives in an engine’s exhaust stream is less clear. There are reports that Russia may be continuing to investigate the possible value of plasma stealth, especially as it related to the development of hypersonic vehicles. There are unconfirmed reports that the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile may have some capabilities in this regard, though the exact method of generating the ionization is unclear. Regardless, ensuring adequate radar-evading effects in the rear aspect remains one of the more challenging elements of designing stealthy aircraft and missiles. So, plasma stealth would certainly continue to be one possible method going about this. Concerns about impacts on the engine from using chemical additives would be largely moot in a one-time-use system, such as a cruise missile. Impacts on actual flight performance from using fuel additives would still be an issue, especially with flight vehicles that need to be flying at extreme speeds to remain stable. Plasma stealth could also be a valuable option for quickly improving the stealthy qualities of existing designs . As was the case with A-50, fuel additives, specifically, could provide a way of rapidly adding in this kind of capability, but only as necessary and with minimal modifications to the aircraft itself. If nothing else, though, the development of the A-50 additive is another intriguing and very obscure part of the story of the A-12, as well as its successor, the SR-71, much of which still remains unknown to this day, and it also offers intriguing insights into the dawn of stealth technology.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 29, 2020",Here’s What The Ball On The Nose Of UAE’s Block 60 F-16E/F Desert Falcon Does,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A significant portion of the correspondence and questions I receive have to do with unique physical features on various ships, ground vehicles, and especially aircraft and what they do. One of the most interesting aspects of modern military technology is the slight differences among evolutions and sub-types of a particular weapon system. In some ways, these small alterations tell a rich story of changes in technological know-how, tactics, and the ever-morphing nature of threats. We write in detail about these unique features and subsystems all the time , but one structure on a particular aircraft variant seems to draw a lot of attention and questions, at least based on what readers ask me about. That is the bulbous nub on the nose of the enigmatic Block 60 F-16E/F “Desert Falcon” developed specifically for the United Arab Emirates Air Force. The F-16E/F is an F-16, but it is one unlike any other F-16 variant in the world. The aircraft is more of a redevelopment of sorts the F-16 than just another incremental upgrade. Originally, when the program spun up in the 1990s, with an order eventually being placed for 80 advanced F-16s in 1998 , the aircraft was going to be an even more drastic redesign of the F-16, similar to how Japan’s F-2 fighter came to be, but with a large delta wing and other aerodynamic tweaks. Block 60 F-16 test aircraft., Lockheed Martin That ambitious concept was jettisoned in favor of drastically enhancing the Block 50/52 F-16C/D Viper. In the end, just developing the F-16E/F cost the UAE a whopping $3B, with the first jet taking to the skies in December of 2003. Years of testing and training would follow, with the first aircraft delivered to the UAE beginning in May of 2005. In total, the force consists of 55 single-seat F-16Es and 25 two-seat F-16Fs, the latter of which include fully missionized rear cockpits. Now very mature, the F-16E/F fleet is already undergoing a series of upgrades. UAE F-16E taking off for a Red Flag sortie. The initial pilot cadre trained in Arizona. , Tyler Rogoway The Block 60 includes a load of enhancements. It has conformal fuel tanks like some of its late-block predecessors, but its F110-GE-132 General Electric turbofan puts out 32,000lbs of thrust. That’s 3,000lbs more than the Block 50’s F110-GE-129. It was built with Northrop Grumman’s AN/APG-80 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar system, which was at the time of introduction into service, and still is, incredibly capable. You can read about the benefits of fighter-sized AESAs in this past piece of ours , but for the F-16, which is something of the hallmark of multi-role fighters, being able to perform multiple modes, such as air-to-air and air-to-ground, simultaneously and seamlessly equals a massive leap in capability and situational awareness. The brutish and muscular look of a Block 60 F-16 head-on., Lockheed Martin/Code One The jet also has an advanced defensive countermeasures and situational awareness system called the Falcon Edge Integrated Electronic Warfare Suite (IEWS). It includes an active jamming system and passive electronic support measures that provide enhanced situational awareness of radio-frequency threats in the jet’s vicinity. It can geolocate those threats and allow the F-16E/F to rapidly target them with precision-guided munitions. It has no less than eight expendable countermeasure dispensers that are tied into its self-defense system and it is also capable of controlling towed fiber-optic decoys. It isn’t perfectly clear, but the Block 60 appears to have been built with a missile approach warning system, or at least the ability to be fitted with one, as well. Lockheed Martin The Block 60’s cockpit was also a big upgrade over the Block 50/52. Three large flat panel displays replace the old smaller multi-function and analog display layout. A wide-angle HUD with holographic video projection capability is also fitted. The rear cockpits of the F models are built for two-crew combat operations, with displays and interfaces to support it. Advanced data links and highly-secure, beyond-line-of-sight communications systems are also installed on these jets, as well. The Desert Falcon was built with a new and greatly improved environmental control system (ECS) to reliably cool all these electrical systems even in the extreme desert heat. USAF Finally, a huge array of advanced weaponry can be carried by the F-16E/F, including standoff weapons like the Small Diameter Bomb , Joint Stand-Off Weapon , and Hakim missile . I could keep going, but you get the idea. These are the most capable F-16s in the world. F-16F seen during tests with the Hakim-A standoff missile. The pod on the chin is likely a data link pod to connect with the missiles during their flight., Unknown/Public Domain Yet one of the Desert Falcon’s most unique systems is its infrared targeting and navigation suite. Known as the AN/AAQ-32 Internal FLIR Targeting System (IFTS), it manifests itself externally in two areas. One is the targeting pod that is installed on one of its two intake pylons. It was derived from Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-28 LITENING targeting pod and acts in a similar fashion to other advanced targeting pods, providing stabilized mid-wave infrared and electro-optical video feeds, as well as laser range-finding, spot tracking, pointer, and targeting functions. Although primarily designed for air-to-ground applications, it can be used for air-to-air search, track, and identification purposes, as well. You can read about this capability and how it works in this past article of ours. USAF Also part of the IFTS is the round nub on the F-16E/F’s nose—the same one that has drawn a lot of interest from readers. Some have posited that this is an infrared search and track system (IRST), but it isn’t. Others thought it was an updated version of Texas Instruments Falcon Eye FLIR system that began development in the 1980s. That system was primarily intended to give pilots the ability to see in the night prior to the integration of night vision goggles into tactical fast jets, which came in the 1990s. Falcon Eye ads from the late 1980s. , Texas Instruments advertisements Similar to the Pilot Night Vision Sensor on the AH-64A Apache, Falcon Eye would swivel around to where the pilot was looking and project that video into a helmet-mounted display, which were somewhat ungainly at the time. Falcon Eye was tested extensively and was seen as an especially attractive potential feature for a battlefield interdiction and close air support version of the F-16, but neither it or the “A-16” really caught on. As mentioned a moment ago, night vision goggles and podded systems like the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared Red for Night (LANTIRN) system would become commonplace and would satisfy the requirement. LANTIRN, in its full installation, is really two pods. The AN/AAQ-14 is the targeting pod with similar capabilities as the LITENING pod described above, albeit in an earlier form. The AN/AAQ-13 is the LANTIRN navigation pod, which housed a terrain-following radar and a staring infrared sensor that would be used to project a view of where the aircraft was going on the HUD in the cockpit. Aircraft like the F-15E and the F-16C/D Block 40 had special raster-scan HUDs that could project the video properly. The system works to also project terrain-following steering cue symbology onto the infrared video displayed on the HUD. AN/AAQ-13 LANTIRN navigational pod on the F-15E. , USAF The projection from the pod’s staring infrared sensor onto the F-15E’s wide-angle HUD., USAF Over time, less reliance on all-weather, low-altitude penetration tactics and the widespread use of night vision goggles by fighter crews, along with advanced navigational upgrades and standoff weaponry, has put less of premium on the capability the AN/AAQ-14 provides. For F-15E crews, it is still a highly relevant capability, but for later block F-16 crews, it is added weight for the vast majority of missions or just isn’t needed at all. But that is based on American needs and tactics. Not a foreign military that bets most of its air dominance and attack capabilities on one multi-role fighter. The novel thing about the Block 60’s IFTS is that it retains all the capability that the LANTIRN system provides and more without having to carry a big second pod on the F-16’s other intake station. The lump on the Block 60’s nose and its AESA radar make this possible. Full LANTIRN installation on a Block 40 F-16C stationed at Osan AFB in South Korea. , USAF The lump is a FLIR system that rotates around to point directly forward when in use. The video it takes is then piped into the F-16E/F’s pilot’s HUD and it can also be shown on the displays in the rear cockpit of the F model. It doesn’t move around with the pilot’s head position, but it does give them a far better view forward at night and in poor weather. Sources familiar with the system note that it doesn’t project its feed into the pilot’s helmet, but it could in the future. It would still only show in the forward field of view, just like a virtual HUD in advanced helmet mounted displays , like the one found in the F-35. A very rare image of the Block 60’s IFTS nose-mounted FLIR out of its stowed position with its aperture pointed forward. Also note the Sniper targeting pod. The F-16E/F fleet has been seen flying with the system from time to time instead of its original pod in recent years., Photo by PETRA via Getty Images You are probably thinking that the Block 60 is still missing the terrain-following radar functionality that a pod like AN/AAQ-13 provides for all-weather low-level penetration capabilities. The thing about the AN/APG-80 AESA radar—not handcuffed by a mechanically scanned antenna that has to literally point at what it is scanning—is that it can provide this capability seamlessly while executing other modes like air-to-air search and ground mapping. In other words, the addition of the FLIR on the nose and the AN/APG-80 AESA radar has allowed for the F-16E/F to have even better low-level capabilities without the need for a second pod. This saves weight, increasing aerodynamic efficiency, frees up a pylon for other sensors in the future, like an IRST, and saves on maintenance and logistics. USAF If nothing else, the installation of the navigational FLIR into the Desert Falcon’s nose and its integration with the targeting pod is indicative of just how far the UAE, Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractors went with refining the highly mature C/D into something more exquisite. It is also a clear indication of what capabilities UAE wanted out of its investment into a super-advanced F-16E/F. Having the ability to penetrate into denied airspace at very-low level and in all weather conditions gives the UAE similar capabilities as their Saudi Neighbors that fly F-15 Strike Eagle derivatives . Combined with the F-16E/F’s advanced defensive suite, these 4.5+ generation fighters are designed with every advantage to survive in contested airspace—aside from stealth. Combined with standoff munitions, like JSOW, SBD, and the Hakim missile, the Block 60 gives the UAE a real ability to reach out and put targets throughout the region in jeopardy. So, there you have it, now you know what that curious nub is on the nose of UAE’s muscular-looking “Desert Falcons,” which still represent the most advanced operational F-16s in the world.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 17, 2019",The Strike On Saudi Oil Facilities Was Unprecedented And It Underscores Far Greater Issues,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I don’t know how better to say it—there was some really shoddy and downright reckless reporting over the weekend on the Saudi oil infrastructure attacks. After catching our readers up with what is going on regarding this developing situation in a post that you need to read here for proper background, I wanted to take the time to talk about some of the inaccurate analysis being cast around in the media and about some of the larger and very pressing issues surrounding the attacks and its aftermath. Away from the office this weekend, I took to Twitter to make a few key points about what I was seeing regarding the strikes. I want to solidify those more completely here. First off, no, the direction of impacts seen in satellite photos is not any sort of conclusive evidence as to where these weapons originated from. I saw this parroted all over the place, from cable and network news to blogs over the weekend. We are talking about what are clearly extremely precise weapons here that are capable of being effectively employed at long standoff ranges. US Government handout US Government handout US Government handout The post-strike satellite images provided by the U.S. Government clearly show just how precise the weapons used were, punching near-identical placed holes into major components of Saudi Arabia’s oil apparatus. The idea that these same weapons, which have to use some form of autopilot to accurately fly to their target area over long distances, can’t simply hit an offset waypoint away from the target before making their final attack run is laughable. In other words, this is not unguided artillery here, it can maneuver dynamically to approach a target from a direction that its targeters find most advantageous—either for kinetic effects, survivability, or deniability reasons. With that in mind, the attacks could have come from any vector-based on impact information alone—Iraq, Yemen, Iran, or even a boat in the Persian Gulf. The weapons could even have been launched from within a nearby friendly country by clandestine forces, although that is quite unlikely. And who is to say they all came from just one locale? Multiple types of weapons —cruise missiles, suicide drones, or even larger low observable drones capable of dropping their own weapons—could have been launched from completely different locations in a coordinated, multi-layer assault. This would have been particularly useful for ensuring some of the weapons make it to their targets and for overwhelming or confusing Saudi air defenses—that is if they are detected and successfully tracked at all. Regardless of their origin, when I first saw the damage, I felt like drones were potentially part of the attack, but likely not the only weapons employed. In fact, it looked a lot like a cruise missile strike with some of those weapons being equipped with shaped charges for penetrating fortified structures and others being equipped with general high explosives warheads for greater effects against unfortified structures. Whoever planned the strike had a very good understanding of the facilities targeted and what their components do, as well as their vulnerabilities and propensity for secondary effects. In other words, it wasn’t just showering a target area with explosive-laden drones or even picking some important-looking structures targeting those. The targeting was systemic in nature and high in quality. That brings us to my next point, one you probably also thought to yourself when this happened—this was an unprecedented attack. Welcome to the murky world of unmanned warfare that I have been warning about for many years. I almost take this issue personally because people use to blow it off or even snicker at it. Now all the predictions I wish were wrong are coming true and at an alarming pace . The Department of Defense was ridiculously asleep at the wheel regarding this threat and is now scrambling to play catchup . Anyone who says differently is straight-up lying. It’s well established what non-state actors can already do with relatively low-end unmanned aircraft technology—Houthi rebels alone have been using suicide drones for two and a half years —just imagine what a peer state will be able to do in the very near future. Instead of a mass of individual suicide drones layered in with other weapons, like cruise missiles, attacking a target simultaneously, imagine a swarm that is fully networked and works cooperatively to best achieve their mission goals, including jamming or killing air defenses in order for the swarm to make it to its final destination. America’s adversaries are all too aware of this game-changing potential and the lack of defenses to counter it in any robust manner. Here’s a cold hard reality that most people just don’t understand, including many defense sector pundits—air defense systems, no matter how advanced and deeply integrated, aren’t magic. They have major limitations, especially considering most primarily rely on ground-based sensors. This is true for the upper end of the envelope, such as ballistic missile defense, and also for the very low end, such as drones and cruise missile defense . In fact, I wrote a piece all about the ‘missile shield’ myth, which mirrors the realities of defending against drones and cruise missiles. I suggest you give it a read. The vast majority of these air defense systems were built to counter higher-end threats, like combat aircraft and ballistic missiles. Low-flying cruise missiles and slow-flying drones with small radar cross-sections remain a very problematic vulnerability to even the best integrated air defense systems on the planet. Short-range air defenses (SHORADs) are currently the most reliable way to effectively deal with these threats, but these systems have a very short reach and are traditionally only used at strategic locations and to protect other high-value target areas. The U.S., and the western world to some degree, has lagged behind pathetically when it comes to fielding SHORAD capabilities and now the Pentagon is scrambling to catch up . Even those systems that do exist were largely designed to shoot down a single target, such as a jet, helicopter, or missile, at a time, not rapidly or even simultaneously engage a swarm of them. You can read all about this issue in this past feature of mine , where I literally predict this exact type of attack. The biggest problem with most SHORAD concepts being pushed forward today—from lasers to missile interceptors—is that they still emanate from a mindset in which the threat is limited in volume. In other words, they can engage a few drones or missiles fairly quickly, but a dozen or dozens descending onto the target area suddenly is far beyond their capabilities. This is why electronic warfare—from jamming to microwave directed energy weapons —is so attractive for dealing with this threat. These systems have the potential to drop a whole swarm or large swathes of it in a way that kinetic systems cannot. The other alternative is something like Israel’s Iron Dome , which is expensive to acquire and deploy, with each Tamir interceptor costing over $50K per round fired (two usually being fired at each target), while also being restricted to a fairly short range. Other more promising and more mobile systems are in the works, and as I have said repeatedly, the best thing to knock down a drone outside of electronic warfare, is probably another drone. This concept is also finally being explored. Beyond SHORAD systems, integrated air defense networks, like Saudi Arabia’s, would benefit greatly from airborne netted sensors that are specifically designed to detect low and/or slow-flying targets with small radar cross-sections. The Army’s long-troubled JLENS blimp is just one concept that exists, although it is attractive because it is very persistent. Smaller aerostats with radars that can cover a smaller area, but still provide ample early warning of approaching drones and cruise missiles, could be another, more scalable option for high-value locales. High-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft can also lug radars aloft that are especially adept at looking-down and detecting these types of targets. In fact, the Block 40 RQ-4B Global Hawk’s Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) gives that aircraft a very sensitive Active Electronically Scanned Array radar that is capable of rapidly scanning huge volumes of airspace for hard to detect threats as well as taking synthetic aperture radar images and tracking moving vehicles on the ground. This latent air-to-air capability has not been developed by the USAF, but it probably should be in light of recent events. A country like Saudi Arabia may find either of these concepts to be a worthy investment going forward, especially considering how much money is being lost in oil production after this strike. There is no doubt about it, Global Hawk isn’t cheap to keep overhead, but considering they can stay up there for nearly a day and a half at a time and they can cover a huge area from their perch at 60,000 feet, they are better adapted to the role than traditional aircraft. Block 40 Global Hawk with MR-RTIP., Northrop Grumman The big takeaway is that this is just the beginning. You are getting a glimpse at the future of warfare in these satellite photos and quite honestly, considering how omnipresent this threat has become , we are lucky a couple busted up oil production facilities were the only result of such an eye-opening attack. The cold hard truth is that counter-unmanned aircraft and counter-cruise missile capabilities are not ‘sexy’ to develop, field, and maintain operationally, but it will increasingly become absolutely essential to divert more funds in this direction. And no, I am not talking about some guys running around with wonky, sci-fi looking electronic warfare rifles. I am saying dense and layered counter-UAS capabilities will be required to even counter domestic threats in the years to come, especially against VIPs and critical infrastructure. We live in an age where everyone has access to high-resolution satellite imagery of nearly any point on the globe. This is something that was unthinkable even following the end of the Cold War. A single individual now has the capabilities that entire government intelligence agencies were built to produce, all on their smartphone or laptop computer. And it’s entirely free! GPS is even more of a revolutionary capability. It’s incredible pinpoint accuracy really has become more concerning since the hobby drone industry exploded and now components to control drones via GPS are somewhat off-the-shelf in nature and are supplied from manufacturers around the globe. With these two things combined, a bad actor has both the targeting intelligence and the precision targeting capabilities available for a minuscule fraction of what they cost in the past and without any major barriers of entry. These types of strikes don’t have to originate beyond a border, they can even originate from anywhere, including right here in the U.S. against U.S. targets. We must change our way of thinking when it comes to precision munitions and drones, and especially the imaginary line that still seems to separate them. In addition, confronting this issue just won’t be about fielding near and very costly military gear, it will also be about implementing, regulations, working with the global community, and a lot of intelligence gathering. The best and cheapest way to stop any attack is to do so before they start. As far as Iran’s involvement in this, that seems pretty damn clear, at least on some level, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they launched some or all of these weapons themselves. The thing is that they have created a unique situation in which they have literally bought deniability via furnishing a rebel force with ‘ indigenous ‘ weapons that are distinct, but similar to their own. Yet there is nothing to say Iran couldn’t use those same “off-brand” weapons themselves. In fact, doing so makes total sense in this case as their Houthi partners were ready and willing to accept responsibility. In the end, the effects are what really matters, not who owns the operation publicly. When it comes to responding to such an act, that certainly isn’t the case. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SNeblGR05xE I have to stress that I am not saying they definitely originated from Iranian territory or vessels, although I think that is very possible, but that this unique situation Iran has built for itself must be taken into account going forward. They literally constructed an elaborate deniability mechanism for themselves. I hope this event is a wakeup call for the powers that be that counter-UAS and cruise missile defense gets more investment, especially in an era of murky hybrid warfare . The startling reality is that this attack could have come by ballistic missile —weapons that cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars—and it would have had a far lesser chance of succeeding. Not only that, the perpetrator would have been known. Yet some drones and/or low-end cruise missiles can accomplish the same effects more reliably and with the added feature of deniability. This alarming strategic truth is not reflected in the incredible sums of money being spent on integrated air defenses, and especially by the Kingdom and the United States. Hopefully, we won’t need another hugely successful attack on a prized target located deep in the heart of highly defended airspace before key decision-makers wake up to nature of what has been and continues to be a totally predictable threat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 21, 2020",This Is What Grumman’s Proposed F-14 Super Tomcat 21 Would Have Actually Looked Like,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Arguably the most famous and beloved American jet fighter, Grumman’s F-14 Tomcat, still firmly holds the public’s attention in its cat claws well over a decade after it was retired from U.S. Navy service. Of the many long-form , very in-depth pieces I have posted on the “Turkey Bird, ” one article from years ago still makes its viral rounds and is the source of constant reader mail— The Super Tomcat That Was Never Built . It was over five years ago that I wrote that piece—the first iteration of it nearly a decade ago—and now, with the help of our favorite aerospace artist Adam Burch from Hangar B Productions , we have forensically recreated what this aircraft would have looked like if it had been built—just like we have done with the F-23 and the F-32 . Not only that, but we also ventured to create theoretical ‘2010s’ upgrade of this aircraft along the same lines as what we have seen with Boeing’s latest F-15 Strike Eagle variants. So, tighten your ejection seat straps, wipe the controls, throttle up, and snap a salute as we rocket you down the catapult into the realm of alternative aerospace history. We need to start with a little backstory on the Super Tomcat 21 from my earlier piece. Some of the details and timelines have been debated, but generally, this is the idea of where the ST21 came from: In our reality, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet became the Navy’s vanguard fighter of the 21st century as a result of the boondoggle that was the A-12 Avenger program . After massive cost overruns, weight increases and huge delays, then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney axed the stealthy carrier-borne flying wing attack jet leaving a huge hole in NAVAIR’s future inventory. This was back in 1991, the Cold War had just ended and we just got done kicking the ass of one of the world’s largest standing armies. Congress had been talked into high-risk, hugely aggressive defense programs for decades and they had had enough. The “peace dividend” sentiment was on the rise and defense budgets were beginning to fall. With the A-6E TRAM Intruder’s retirement imminent and in the vacuum created by the canceled A-12 program, manufactures starting throwing out “logical growth” designs based on existing platforms [some were even rehashed and updated concepts from years prior]. The hope was that if aircraft manufacturers make an almost entirely new aircraft look like an existing type, while also giving them a familiar “evolutionary” designation, Congress would see the product as a low-risk, low-cost upgrade of a proven platform and thus move forward with its procurement. At the same time the NATF program (the Navy’s equivalent to the USAF’s Advanced Tactical Fighter program) was in the works, but the costs and timeline for its development would have been massive, and in light of what happened to the stealthy A-12 “Flying Dorito,” it was clear that something simpler was needed. In the end, this “low-risk” and familiar design concept worked via the eventual development and procurement of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Yet in some people’s opinion, it worked for the wrong aircraft. The Super Tomcat 21 grew out of a previous proposal made by Grumman after the collapse of the A-12 program called Quick Strike [one of my sources says it actually came before Quick Strike, but was rehashed later]. Quick Strike was meant to be an upgrade for existing F-14s by giving them high-end navigation and targeting pods similar to the USAF’s LANTIRN system , along with upgraded ground attack modes for F-14D’s APG-71 Radar (based on the aircraft’s original AWG-9 radar) and the ability to carry more standoff weaponry like the AGM-84E SLAM and AGM-88 HARM . Quick Strike was aimed more at cheaply picking up the Intruder’s slack than at replacing the A-12’s high-end capability, and was seen at the time as an insufficient technological leap over the F-14B and D models already in service. Also, rumors that an inexpensive clean sheet next-generation Hornet design was in the works over at McDonnell Douglas did not help Quick Strike’s attractiveness. So, Grumman came back to the Navy with a true “Super Tomcat,” called the Super Tomcat 21 [ST21]. As noted above, this also occurred around the same time that it was becoming clear that the NATF wasn’t going to happen. So, whereas Quick Strike could help replace the gap left by the Intruder, the ST21 could plug that hole and the one left by the NATF, performing its same proposed mission, albeit without the advantage of stealth and a number of other cutting-edge, high-risk technologies. Grumman’s notional roadmap for the Tomcat. , Grumman The Super Tomcat 21 would include a variety of enhancements over the F-14D and it could be produced via remanufacturing existing F-14 airframes or it could be ordered via a new-build arrangement. Most likely a combination of both options would have been used, just like the F-14D. Remember that the last new-build Tomcat had rolled off the Bethpage, New York production line in 1992, so it’s not like the F-14 inventory was long in the tooth or its production line had gone cold for an extensive period of time when the Super Tomcat 21 was being considered. Grumman F-14 Super Tomcat 21 model. It now hangs in the Cradle Of Aviation Museum in Garden City, NY. It gave a general arrangement for the ST21. , Public Domain via “GE Geoff” Public Domain via “GE Geoff” The ST21 would have incorporated a bunch of highly logical features that would accentuate the Tomcat’s attributes and mitigate its deficiencies. These were largely already available or relatively mature technologies. As a result, Grumman could start delivering ST21s as soon as the mid-1990s. Hangar B Productions These proposed modifications were all documented and largely included the following: F110-GE-429 turbofan engines. This 29K pound thrust class engine, a modification of the same variant found in later block F-16s and now some Strike Eagle derivatives, albeit with a longer exhaust pipe tailored to the Tomcat, would give the ST21 supercruise performance (>Mach 1 without the use of gas-guzzling afterburner) while carrying a relevant air-to-air loadout. Some state M1.2-1.4 supercruise would have been possible. Enlarged and recontoured leading-edge gloves with an additional 2,200lbs of fuel storage each. Underfuselage-mounted Ford Aerospace (now Lockheed Martin) Night Owl targeting pod/FLIR and navigation pod. Single-piece windscreen for enhanced visibility. Wide-angle raster-scan HUD capable of projecting FLIR imagery. Glass cockpit. New mission computers and graphics processors. On-Board Oxygen Generations System (OBOGS) AN/APG-71 radar with additional upgrades ported over from the AN/APG-70 used on the F-15E. Expanded range and capabilities over the original AN/APG-71 in F-14D, which itself was an outgrowth of the AWG-9. Digital Flight Control System (DFCS). Wet wing pylons capable of carrying 300-gallon external tanks. Ability to carry 425-gallon external tanks on nacelle hardpoints if it was developed. Existing tank size 280 gallons. Larger multi-segmented fowler-flaps. Enlarged and extended slats on wing leading-edge. Bring-back to ship capacity increased from 9k lbs to 16k lbs. Reduced approach speed and better slow-speed control. Integration of latest standoff weaponry, as well as AIM-120 AMRAAM. Upgraded AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispenser. Integration of the BOL countermeasures dispensers into the outboard pylons as a mission configuration option. A host of other less prominent features would also be included. These include redesigned hydraulic and environmental control systems, and smaller changes to the Tomcat’s flight controls and aerodynamics for enhanced performance, stability, and maintainability. The ST21’s gross weight would have also increased, which may have led to slight enhancements to its already very stout landing gear. The F-14D’s radar warning and electronic countermeasures suite would have been carried over initially with some smaller updates, but that would likely have become an area of focus for future upgrades, which we will get to in a moment. In all, the ST21 would have been a mighty beast of a multi-role fighter. With drastically expanded fuel capacity, both internally and externally, its range and loiter time would have been increased quite dramatically. Combined with supercruise in an air-to-air combat configuration, AIM-120 capability, and its modern Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system and updated Television Camera Set (TCS) ported over from the F-14D, the ST21 would have pushed the Tomcat into a new realm of air superiority fighter and fleet defender. In fact, no other fighter in the world would have possessed similar long-range target detection and identification capabilities. The upgrades to its engines, slats, digital flight control system, windscreen, and HUD, as well as smaller tweaks to its other control surfaces including its spoilers, would have made it a more formidable close-in dogfighter. The nav/attack pod setup would have provided a low-altitude, all-weather precision deep strike capability similar to the F-15E . Standoff weapons integration would have expanded the carrier’s tactical reach dramatically, as well, and those new weapons would have fit perfectly with the Tomcat’s heavy load carrying capabilities. It may have even seen the AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile get upgraded again and kept in service longer to take advantage of the ST21’s hugely powerful sensor suite. Really, the ST21 represents what many always dreamed of the Tomcat being while also keeping its capabilities firmly grounded in technology that was readily available at the time. In many ways, technology finally would have caught up with the Tomcat’s airframe design. The ST21 configuation leaves a lot of room for future upgrades that could take its individual and force multiplier capabilities to yet another level. The Super Tomcat 21. , Hangar B Productions The Super Tomcat 21. , Hangar B Productions The Super Tomcat 21. , Hangar B Productions The Super Tomcat 21. , Hangar B Productions The Super Tomcat 21. , Hangar B Productions The Super Tomcat 21. , Hangar B Productions During the early 1990s, even a more drastic upgrade of the Tomcat was being floated as part of Grumman’s future roadmap that did not include the NATF—the Advanced Strike Fighter 14 (ASF-14). This aircraft would have been a total redesign of the Tomcat leveraging advanced technologies from the NATF initiative. This would have been a costly new-build endeavor that would have likely gone significantly beyond what McDonnell Douglas did with their Super Hornet offering. In reality, a follow-on to the ST21 in the form of the ASF-14 was unlikely even if the ST21 would of been procured. But if the Navy were to of invested heavily back into the Tomcat platform in the form of the ST21 in the mid-1990s, that aircraft would have very possibly seen a mid-life upgrade with a similar suite of technologies as what Boeing has injected into its F-15 line via the F-15SA as well as the F-15QA and the F-15X , to a bit lesser degree. This would likely have involved upgrading existing ST21 airframes with new technologies in a relatively economical manner. Based on this conjecture, we carefully, realistically, and rationally put together what the ST21 would have likely grown into by the 2010s. We named this upgraded aircraft the Super Tomcat 2010, or ST2010. Hypothetical Super Tomcat 2010, Hangar B Productions This upgrade would hypothetically expand upon the existing ST21 in the following ways: Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. The F-14 has the largest radar aperture of any American fighter ever. As such, the ST2010 would have sported the most powerful AESA of any fighter in the world. A variant of the AN/APG-63(V)3 used by the Eagle, with enhanced multi-mode capabilities, just like the AN/APG-82 that the F-15Es are receiving today, but with a bigger antenna array, would have been the most likely system to satisfy this requirement. The radome would be slightly redesigned to accommodate the AESA radar set. AN/APX-111(V) “pizza box” identification friend or foe (IFF) interrogator/transponder found on the Super Hornet mounted in the same position on the ST2010’s nose. Both crew stations equipped with Digital Joint-Helmet Mounted Cuing System (D-JHMCS II) helmet-mounted displays with night vision capability. Full AIM-9X capability. Upgraded cockpit displays with enhanced large area display in the RIO’s section. Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod replaces Ford Aerospace Night Owl targeting pod or whatever would have been in service at the time. Nav pod is retained or removed depending on mission needs. Beyond-line-of-sight SATCOM receive capability that can push real-time threat, blue-force tracking, and critical mission information to the Super Tomcat. It can then push parts of that information out to any platform within line-of-sight with Link 16 connectivity. The EA-18G Growler was built with this capability, which is now in its second generation. Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS). With apertures on the upper nose, lower nose pod, leading-edge gloves, upper fuselage, lower fuselage, and atop the ST2010’s twin tails, this system provides total situational awareness of incoming missiles and other threats ( potentially DAS upgradable in the future) and is tied into the aircraft’s defensive suite. Expanded AN/ALE-47 expendable countermeasures capacity. Fully integrated towed fiber-optic decoys in housings near the rear of the ST2010’s under-fuselage ‘tunnel.” Retains original speed-brake for terminal phases of flight, but digital flight control system can execute speed brake functionality using deflection of control surfaces and upper speed brake surface. Replace AN/AAS-44 infrared search and track system with IRST21 . Updated mission computer and graphics display processors. Integration of latest standoff weaponry such as Small Diameter Bomb, JSOW , SLAM-ER, WCMD , Laser JDAM , etc. Digital electronic warfare system. Modern, fully integrated digital electronic warfare and threat awareness suite that will also control countermeasures, towed decoys, AESA electronic warfare modes, and more. The RIO’s large display will allow them to work as mission managers with sensor, electronic warfare suite, data-link, and satellite data-link information displayed for maximum situational awareness. Hypothetical Super Tomcat 2010, Hangar B Productions Hypothetical Super Tomcat 2010, Hangar B Productions Hypothetical Super Tomcat 2010, Hangar B Productions Hypothetical Super Tomcat 2010, Hangar B Productions The ST2010 would be as much about what the platform could do as a force multiplier than about its own individual combat capabilities. This aircraft would field the most powerful sensor suite on any aircraft in American fighter history. With the largest fighter AESA array in the inventory, the latest infrared search and track sensor, the ability to receive threat data and other information via satellite from all the Pentagon’s networked assets, and possessing its own highly-sensitive electronic surveillance and warfare system, the ST2010 could broadcast all that data to other less capable platforms that are within its line-of-sight. Basically, we are talking about a flying and fighting primary sensor and data-exchange node here as much as just a more capable fighter. The concept isn’t all that unique as the USAF is adapting it to their own F-15C/D fleet as part of the Talon Hate program. The ST2010 would also be more survivable than its predecessor, not only due to its advanced digital electronic warfare suite, but via expanded expendable countermeasures capacity, towed fiber-optic decoys, larger cockpit displays, and 360-degree missile approach warning system (MAWS). It would also feature Digital-Joint Helmet Mounting Cueing Systems in both cockpits and full AIM-9X capability. Hypothetical Super Tomcat 2010, Hangar B Productions Another logical addition includes the replacement of the NITE OWL targeting pod with a Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod and the ability to carry the latest standoff weaponry, including JSOW, SDB, AIM-9X, AIM-120D, and more. The ST2010’s use as a heavy lifting and long-hauling weapons truck for large outsized payloads would also be taken into account. It could find great utility as the fleet’s hypersonic weapons hauler as well-performing its more traditional duties. But it has to be stressed again that the ST2010 hypothetical upgrade isn’t all about kinetic capabilities, it is about working as a fast-flying sensor and networking platform. Fully tanked up, it would have very long endurance and it could fully protect itself while traveling into and out of the target area. The pilot could deal with air-to-air and air-to-ground threats while the RIO ‘quarterbacks’ the fight—enabling other assets in the air wing and across the joint force. Just the ST2010’s AESA radar alone can execute air-to-air and air-to-ground functions seamlessly and concurrently, and we are talking about it possessing a range of many hundreds of miles here. In fact, the ST2010 could work as a mini-AWACS if need be. Most importantly, it features technologies that were in a mature or near-mature state around the early part of this decade. As such, we are talking about a huge capability boost here via a low-risk, high-reward upgrade that once again builds on the F-14’s unique attributes. This patch would have been reason enough to build the ST21!, Hangar B Productions So, there you have it, what could have been when it comes to America’s most beloved jet fighter. In the end, the Navy got a good plane in the Super Hornet, but it just can’t compare in terms of raw performance and other key attributes that the ST21 would have brought to the table. Who knows, maybe in an alternative universe there are nuclear supercarriers that had their decks packed with upgraded and new build legacy F/A-18Cs and ST21s as the new millennium settled in. For the rest of us in the prime timeline, what could have been will just have to remain something to ponder, or in Adam Burch’s case, to render in spectacular and highly detailed fashion. Author’s Note: A huge, massive thanks to Adam Burch. He is so amazing to work with. He put up with a lot on this one in terms of endless notes and change requests. There were roughly 150 emails that went into finalizing these designs. I can’t thank him enough for bringing his amazing artistic skills and passion for all things aerospace to these projects. For me, they literally are something of a dream come true. Make absolutely sure you follow Hangar-B Productions on Instagram and on Twitter , and you should check out his website too .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Shadowy New Electronic Warfare System Has Been Installed On U.S. Navy 7th Fleet Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Department Of Defense’s supposed “pivot to the Pacific” began nearly a decade ago. Since then, the threats that drove it have evolved, diversified, and spread. This expanded strategic focus has been redefined geographically to include the Indian and Pacific Oceans, a vast territory renamed the Indo-Pacific in Pentagon parlance. With China, Russia, and North Korea all rising in terms of the threat they pose to American interests in this increasingly volatile region, advanced and highly tailored capabilities are being rapidly fielded to counter them. One such system is a major yet nearly unacknowledged addition to the existing electronic warfare defensive suites installed aboard America’s fighting ships forward-deployed to the 7th Fleet’s vast area of responsibility. When you think of a surface combatant’s last line of self-defense against incoming threats, you probably think of close-in weapons systems like the fast-firing Phalanx or super-nimble missiles like the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile . Yet the truth is that a ship’s ‘soft kill’ electronic warfare systems are just as, if not more important than its kinetic ones. These systems have gone from being independent jammers to highly integrated components of the vessel’s ‘nervous system’ that includes sensors, communications, and command and control interfaces. Expendable decoys that now carry active electronic warfare payloads are also part of a ship’s non-kinetic self-defense suite, and so is enhanced situational awareness. The most well known of these systems is the long-serving and still evolving AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) found on nearly all large US Navy vessels. In its contemporary form, it has gained the ability to passively detect and geolocate many types of emissions and emitters in the battlespace, significantly adding to situational awareness of the vessels that it is installed on, as well as other platforms they are connected with via data link, and thus enhancing their collective survivability. It also allows for its guileful electronic warfare capabilities to be employed against communications systems, ships’ radars, and other emitters, not just marauding anti-ship cruise missiles and aircraft. AN/SLQ-32 on the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Lake Erie. Various versions of the “Slick 32” are deployed across the U.S. Navy’s fleet and have been for decades. , Yasu Osugi/Wikicommons The Block III iteration of SEWIP takes these capabilities to a whole new level via the addition of the latest in active electronically scanned array technology and other enhancements. In fact, it seems obvious that SEWIP is developing into an offensive weapon system as well as a defensive one. You can read all about SEWIP and its Block III capabilities in this past War Zone feature . Even though it gets all the notoriety, the AN/SLQ-32 is no longer the only major electronic warfare system in the Navy’s ‘topside’ electronic warfare ecosystem. I realized that a substantial new set of electronic warfare hardware had been fielded after I spotted something strange when I randomly reexamined the photos of the badly damaged destroyer USS Fitzgerald that were taken after its horrific collision in June of 2017. Just above the damage, a pair of strange, faceted, coffin-like structures are seen attached to the Arleigh Burke class destroyer’s bridge wings. This image jolted my memory. AP I remembered hearing about a new system being rushed to the 7th Fleet the better part of a decade ago, but had not noticed it manifest itself physically since that somewhat obscure initial report. That is until I realied it was hanging on the bridge wings of Fitzgerald . This configuration is not common across the fleet. I double-checked after examining hundreds of photos of other Arleigh Burke class destroyers that operate around the globe. USS Sampson (DDG 102), left, and USS Preble (DDG 88) seen together on 4/11/18. Note the missing coffin-like attachments to the bridge wings. This is common across the fleet. , US Navy Upon further examination of America’s surface combatants forward deployed as part of the 7th Fleet, it appears that at least the destroyers, cruisers, and the nuclear supercarrier USS Ronald Reagan are all equipped with the system. See the photos below as examples: USS Antietam (CG-54) and USS Chancellorsville (CG-62), both based in Japan, are seen with this new system. , USN Here’s another view of the cruiser mounting arrangement., US Navy Crop of the image above. , US Navy USS Chancellorsville (CG 62) alongside USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)., US Navy Crop of the image above. , US Navy USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) has the same arrays dispersed around the perimeter of the ship., US Navy US Navy USS Mustin (DDG-89) with the same installation., US Navy A close-up of the USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG-54) new EW installation., Hunini/Wikicommons The faceted enclosures for this electronic warfare hardware are meant to open up like a clamshell for easy access to the systems inside. On the Arleigh Burke class destroyers, extendable platforms swing out below the bridge wings so that these enclosures and their contents can be accessed and serviced safely by the ship’s crew. Upon researching the subject, it turns out there is some, albeit very limited information on this system. The system itself is designed in part by ITT Exilis (now L3Harris) and designated the AN/SLQ-59, but it is also known by the general concept it is built upon—the Transportable Electronic Warfare Module, or TEWM for short. TEWM was designed from the outset to be rapidly replicated if need be and installed on additional vessels. It is modular and highly adaptable in nature. In other words, it can be reconfigured easily to address emerging threats and can be easily moved physically and integrated onto new platforms or even land installations. Its self contained, shock-resistant, weatherized enclosure was built to be ported over from ship-to-ship as needed. So, while AN/SLQ-32 is highly integrated into the ship it is installed on, AN/SLQ-59 is more of a plug-and-play design. It is also the core component under the regionally tailored SEWIP Block 3T initiative that is now being fielded across the 7th Fleet. As far as its applications, it is only described as a counter-terminal threat defensive system. In other words, it is built, at least primarily , to fend off enemy missiles—or other weapons—during their end-game attack on the ship itself. It is also fully networked enabled and can be controlled either by the host ship itself or remotely as part of a larger integrated electronic warfare employment strategy. Just as I recollected it, it came to be in its present form under a rapid development “Speed Of Fleet” procurement concept aimed at giving critical electronic warfare capabilities augmentation to the 7th Fleet. U.S. Pacific Command, which the 7th Fleet is beholden to, urgently requested 24 of the systems in 2013, with the hardware itself to be fielded by March of 2014. It isn’t clear if that actually happened. In fact, it seems like the system may have been delayed a year or two. Its roots actually go back substantially farther than this urgent request as a far less production representative arrangement was undergoing experimental testing many years prior, with an early proof of concept version of the TWEM being tested during RIMPAC in 2008. It was tested again aboard the USS Sampson during RIMPAC 2010. This is the only image available showing a detailed image of what appears to be a prototype for this system. The systems appear to have to apertures for what could be active electronically scanned arrays or some other type of emitters. The caption via Defense Media Network reads: Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Jonathan Greenert views an electronic warfare system exhibit while visiting the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to talk with NRL leadership and project experts, Washington, D.C., Dec. 6, 2013. During his visit, Greenert also toured NRL facilities to observe ongoing innovations to electronic warfare systems, anti-submarine warfare projects and autonomous systems. A recently issued Broad Agency Announcement is seeking proposals to transition innovative programs into existing acquisition programs., U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Peter D. Lawlor It remains unclear what the threat—or threats—prompted the sudden initiative to field a production version of the system, but the reality of American vessels operating in close proximity to Chinese shores and People’s Liberation Army Navy ships, as well as being able to better counter Russian threats, which were also on the rise, are the most likely reasons. Considering the fact that American surface combatants are now regularly sailing into territory that is openly contested by China, while under layers-upon-layers of anti-ship capabilities, in retrospect, the need to rush such a system into operation makes sense. With China’s island-building campaign rapidly maturing in the first half of the decade, the writing was on the wall for the U.S. Navy that it would have to more actively challenge China’s territorial claims and that the tension between the countries would escalate, at least in part, as a result of such operations. This realization, as well as Chinese weapons advances , likely spurred AN/SLQ-59’s arrival in the Indo-Pacific region. Some posit that a particular weapon sparked the need for the system. That may be true, but considering that we have no clear idea of exactly what it is aimed at countering, speculation as to what weapon catalyzed its deployed remains just that, speculation. It would have been something that the AN/SLQ-32 suite couldn’t counter reliably. Some have speculated the request was a result of developments in Chinese anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities, this is possible, but given their mounting locations, this seemed less likely than an advanced cruise anti-ship missile system—possibly one with extreme speed and a relatively exotic radar seeker. Others posited that it is a response to a North Korean development, which is almost laughably unlikely considering that country’s level of sophistication when it comes to cruise missile technology. The truth is that the AN/SLQ-59 could have been designed to counter something that isn’t a missile at all, like swarms of small drones that could wreak havoc on a sensor-covered fighting ship, or a swarm of explosive-laden unmanned boats. China is very active in the development of both types of weapons concepts . It’s also worth keeping in mind that the enclosures and the systems within near certainly have the ability to support multiple EW applications simultaneously. In fact, China’s ability to layer multiple threats at a single target simultaneously is probably what, at least in part, these systems are meant to counter. Regardless, the upgrade was needed and this eventually materialized in the form of the shadowy and strangely shaped AN/SLQ-59. The system does show up in budget documents. For instance, under the AN/SLQ-32 line item in the 2019 budget, AN/SLQ-59 is described cryptically as such: Block 3T (AN/SLQ-59) will provide an Electronic Attack (EA) capability improvement required for the AN/SLQ32(V) system to keep pace with the threat. Block 3T provides initial, limited interim capability of a focused application of the Naval Research Lab (NRL) Transportable EW Module (TEWM) system to meet an urgent operational needs (UON) statement. DoD Document Another similar tailored system is being developed for the 6th Fleet, although it is unclear what physical form it will take. As it sits now, enclosures similar to those used on the AN/SLQ-59 have not appeared on any of the vessels assigned to the region, at least as far as we have seen. Regardless, this 6th Fleet-focused system is designated the AN/SLQ-62. If anything, the AN/SLQ-59 is a reminder of how electronic warfare’s place in modern naval warfare, and any domain of warfare for that matter , continues to expand at an accelerated rate and how the Navy is increasingly looking toward acquiring highly adaptable and largely modular capabilities instead on ones that require deep and costly integration into its platforms. In fact, the USMC has bet the vast majority of its own organic electronic warfare capabilities on a similar concept that you can read about here and here . So, with all that said, 7th Fleet ship crews can sleep a little better in their berths knowing that they are being shielded from enemy threats with an extra layer of advanced electronic protection, and maybe during actual sustained combat, they might be able to execute their own electronic attacks like never before thanks to the latest SEWIP enhancements and the mysterious AN/ALQ-59.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 2, 2019",We Now Know What This Unique Pop-Up Nose Panel On Air Force One And Nightwatch 747s Is For,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Air Force operates two variants of the Boeing 747, a pair of VC-25A “Air Force One” aircraft used for presidential airlift missions and four E-4B “Nightwatch” airborne command posts . Both are based on the increasingly vintage 747-200 platform and both are capable of aerial refueling. The somewhat iconic hump on their noses is where the refueling receptacle and slipway are located. The only other 747s in the world that have this feature are the KC-747s, originally referred to as KC-33s, operated by the Iranian Air Force. You can read all about those aircraft in this past article of mine . All these aircraft also share what has been something of a mysterious panel between the cockpit windscreen and the refueling receptacle. I set out to answer what this odd feature does and I ended up with a most interesting answer. When it comes to aircraft like the VC-25A or E-4B that are covered in specialized aerials and missions system, decoding what all those humps, lumps, blisters, and apertures do is a fond pastime of the most ardent aerospace aficionados. At least for me, the panel above the refueling receptacle was pretty much the last piece of the puzzle, so I began researching it and came up with very little. You can clearly see the panel just above the aerial refueling receptacle slipway bulge on the VC-25A.  , Tyler Rogoway/Author That is until I noticed a particularly clear and unobstructed photo of an E-4B refueling. When I looked closely the panel in question was clearly deployed in an upright position. In addition, it not only existed on these USAF 747s, but it was also present on Iran’s 747 tankers. So clearly, its utility rooted in the aerial refueling process. But for what? I had never seen this before on other receiver aircraft. Beyond fulfilling a number of strategic roles for the Pentagon and the U.S. Government overall, Air Force One pilots train for air-to-air refueling contingency operations aboard the E-4B., Senior Airman Mary O’Dell (left) NATO Refueling Manual (Right) Maybe it was meant to keep spray off the windscreen? That seemed most plausible, but I found the cockpit videos below showing E-4Bs tanking with the panel extended and a bad seal between the boom and the receptacle resulting in constant spray directly on the windscreen. So that wasn’t it. Then I thought maybe it exists to protect the windscreen from the boom accidentally impacting it. But upon further contemplation, that seemed like an odd requirement as other aircraft have their receptacles in somewhat sensitive places and they don’t have similar deflection systems. Frustrated, I reached out to a veteran boom operator contact of mine for answers and answers I received! It turns out that the system in question exists for aerodynamic and flight control purposes—it was a spoiler. Knowing that, I was able to find the NATO air-to-air refueling manual online, which discusses each aircraft’s unique issues when it comes to tanking. E-4B refuelings from a KC-10. , Army Sgt. Amber I. Smith The section for the E-4B clearly states: The aircraft is provided with a receptacle “spoiler”, 1 foot high and 2 feet across, located just aft of the AAR receptacle. It is designed to reduce/normalize receiver pilot pitch control problems. With the spoiler retracted, receiver pilot workload is greatly increased to control E-4 pitch oscillations encountered when closing from 10 to 2 feet and when contact is made. … AAR with the receiver’s A/R spoiler retracted shall only be accomplished with a minimum of the tanker autopilot elevator axis and altitude hold engaged, and the yaw damper on. You can see the pages in question for yourself here: ATB-56(B) manual ATB-56(B) manual So there you have it. This unique pop-up spoiler significantly helps E-4B and VC-25A pilots better control the pitch of the aircraft during delicate aerial refueling operations. In fact, executing a refueling evolution without it operable seems to be quite challenging, at least according to the manual. The spoiler also has floodlights that help illuminate the slipway and receptacle for the boom operator. You can see the lights on the spoiler in these nighttimes refueling operations images. , Staff Sgt. Micaiah Anthony (left), Senior Master Sgt.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 16, 2020",Canadian Destroyers Had These Totally Wacky Sea Sparrow Missile Launcher Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Raytheon’s RIM-7 Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile—which was directly adapted from the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile—quickly became a huge success, serving with the U.S. Navy and many allied armadas after first entering into service 45 years ago. One NATO ally, in particular, fitted a class of surface combatants with a Sea Sparrow launcher system that was laughably bizarre and supposedly remarkably ineffective. Those ships were Canada’s Iroquois class destroyers , also known as the Tribal class. The Sea Sparrow system has evolved drastically in terms of capability and form over the decades. You can read all about its earlier and more basic version in this past article of ours . Now in its RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile Block II form, it still enjoys great success. The RIM-7 was designed as a fast-reaction point defense system used to swat down incoming anti-ship missiles and aircraft, some of which could pop-up with little notice as they skim low and fast over the water. Its range was limited to a dozen miles, but in reality, it was usually quite less than that depending on the intercept parameters, conditions, and the missile and fire control system model. From manually aimed box launchers, to automated ones like the Mk29 still in use today , to vertical launch variants, the Sea Sparrow was adapted for many different launching methods. Yet the strangest had to the one found on Canada’s Iroquois class. About seven years ago, someone who had worked with RIM-7s on U.S. Navy vessels told me about how nuts the Canadian launch system was that he had seen demonstrated in the late 1980s. In fact, he said it was so clumsy and slow reacting, that it largely defeated the main purpose of the missile system, at least in a multitude of circumstances. “Remarkably worthless” was the way he described it. I had long forgotten about this exchange until recently when pictures of this exact system popped up on the always lively Reddit page r/Warshipporn . At first, when I saw the images I was flabbergasted as to how weird the setup was, then the memory of the conversation hit me. This is what my contact was talking about! Four Iroquois class destroyers were commissioned between 1972 and 1973 and all served until 2005, with the last example being retired two years ago, in 2017. They featured the MKIII Sea Sparrow system fitted inside their forward deckhouse, with doors that opened up on each side and overhead swing-arm launchers carrying four missiles each (eight in total, four on each side) that extended out from their garage-like enclosure that hung out off the side of the ship strangely when at the ready. The whole arrangement looks like something far from conducive to high sea state, not to mention rocket blast from the missiles, or a combat environment, for that matter. 32 missiles were carried in all, with twelve at the ready on each side, but reloading the system as a whole was a slow process. Public Domain Public Domain In addition, it’s said that the Hollandse Signaal Mk22 Weapon Control System wasn’t really up to the task and just deploying the missiles and warming up their guidance systems could take minutes or longer. All of this is far from ideal for what is supposed to have been a fast-reacting point defense system capable of quickly fending off sea-skimming anti-ship missiles that arrive with little warning from over the horizon. Check out the system in action in the rare video below: Eventually, the weird Sea Sparrow system was replaced as part of a deep refit of these vessels known as the Tribal Refit and Update Modernisation Program (TRUMP) that would give them a number of enhanced features, including a true anti-air warfare capability via the installation of a Mark 41 Vertical Launch System. It had 29 cells that could accommodate Standard SM-2 missiles. Sensors and combat subsystems were also upgraded at the time. The area where the Sea Sparrows were originally installed was repurposed for an OTO Melara 76 mm Super Rapid gun. So there you have it, Canada’s Iroquois/Tribal class destroyers had one of the oddest shipboard missile launchers in naval warfare history, although it certainly has some tough competition . It’s also a reminder of just how revolutionary the Mark 41 vertical launch system truly was.

Tim McMillan,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",Here Is How The Pentagon Comes Up With Code Words And Secret Project Nicknames,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If there’s one place one can find plenty of nicknames, it’s within the sprawling landscape of the armed forces. When it comes to the greater civilian world, there’s no historical precedent or agreed upon social norm for how someone or something gains a substitute informal title. However, given the Department of Defense’s fondness of rigid structure, it should be no surprise that when it comes to nicknames, there’s a policy for them, too. Meet NICKA Prior to 1975, names for military operations and projects were exclusively chosen at the behest of military commanders. As a result, within the annals of American military history one can find a diverse range of interesting titles from Operation Killer —a major 1951 counter-offensive during the Korean War—to Operation Beaver Cage —a U.S. Marine Corps operation that occurred during the spring of 1967 as part of the Vietnam War. However, shortly after the close of the Vietnam War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) decided it was time to formalize the use of code words and nicknames by unveiling the Code Word Nickname and Exercise Term System, colloquially known as NICKA. For the Department of Defense (DoD), NICKA is both a set of policies governing the selection of defense monikers and a military-wide computer system that archives and prevents duplication of terms. Important to note, NICKA is primarily used for Department of Defense-related endeavors. Many operations or programs emerging from within the intelligence community use their own separate naming system. For example, the Central Intelligence Agency uses the Cryptonym system for developing code words and names. It is also worth noting that the National Security Agency (NSA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) all use the NICKA system NICKA outlines three distinctive types of monikers that can be used within the DoD: Code Words Nicknames Exercise Terms The two-word names of highly regarded secret programs like Tacit Blue, which was centered around Northrop’s very stealthy “Whale” demonstrator (seen above), are actually nicknames assigned to the programs and entered into the NICKA database. , Public Domain Code Words In NICKA, a code word is a single word that’s assigned to any program or operational plan that’s classified confidential or higher. Each component agency in the Department of Defense are assigned blocks of code words by the Joint Staff. When needed, the NICKA computer program will randomly select and assign a code word from the originating agency’s allocated block of terms. For example, in the lead up to the Gulf War, when the Combat Aviation Brigade of the 1st Armored Division needed a code word for their forward assembly area, the NICKA computer system pulled from one of the Army’s predetermined block designations and selected the amusingly mundane code word—LARRY. Essentially a password for entry in an exclusive club, the preeminent role of code words is to restrict access to sensitive national security information to only those who have a need to know. Assisting security, a code word itself will be safeguarded by being classified by one of the three security classifications—confidential, secret, or top secret—based on the security level of the associated program. Virtually anything conceivably classified, including programs, projects, locations, operations, objectives, missions, or plans, can be assigned a code word. One particular area code words can be highly prevalent is with Special Access Programs (SAP). As mentioned in The War Zone’s in-depth look at Special Access Programs , multiple components, sub-components, and projects can sprawl out from a single SAP “umbrella.” In this compartmentalized system of security, each of the different appendages of one SAP can potentially be assigned their own specific code word. Once NICKA assigns a code word, it’s considered active. An active code word will remain unchanged for the life of a program and cannot be altered by its users. The one exception being if there’s a concern a code word had been compromised. In this instance, a new code word would be issued. Equally, in certain situations, an unclassified cover term may get applied to a program for counterintelligence purposes. In addition to the obvious security and oversight reasons, the principal reason for a code word’s permanence relates to the significant role NICKA serves as an archive of all active and inactive code words. The system uses its database of terms to prevent any potential conflicts that could arise due to similarities or duplication of previous code words. As a Department of Defense system, NICKA will only assign single-word code words. However, in some instances, the Pentagon may take over a project or program that originated outside of the DoD, such as from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Department of Energy (DOE), commercial companies, or even foreign governments. In these instances, already assigned code words may not follow NICKA guidelines. In these occurrences, a program may be reassigned a new NICKA code word or the previous unregulated code name may be maintained. Regardless, of whether it’s kept or not, the non-NICKA code name may still be added to the program’s database to stem off any future confusion or conflict. For example, technically before NICKA’s time and not a DoD project, the 1960s A-12 reconnaissance plane was developed and operated under the CIA code word “ OXCART ”. However, Kelly Johnson and his pioneering team of engineers at Lockheed Skunk Works used the code word “ARCHANGEL” for the A-12. Furthering the spy plane’s eventual identity crisis, flight crews would nickname the A-12 “Cygnus.” Though OXCART was the only officially assigned government code word, under NICKA, both the contract code word, “ARCHANGEL” and the A-12’s nickname “Cygnus,” would equally be archived to prevent duplicate use. The SR-71 Blackbird (left) and A-12 (Right). , CIA When it comes to code words. Many real-world military operations and programs, for example, “ HAVE BLUE, “ “ ACID GAMBIT ,” “AUTUMN RETURN ,” “SENIOR TREND ,” or the infamous “ YELLOW FRUIT ,” are often reported as being the “code word” for a classified operation or program. However, per DoD and the Joint Chiefs NICKA policy , a code word always consist of just a single word. By NICKA, the above named examples would be “nicknames” and not code words. This does not mean that multiple code words cannot apply to a certain entity. Any intelligence product that contains Top-Secret NATO information would carry the code word “COSMIC” in addition to any other applicable ones. Certain categories of sensitive activities can even involve code words that become intrinsically linked and enter common usage linked together. “TALENT,” an overarching code word for aerial intelligence-gathering assets, such as the U-2 Dragon Lady and SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, and “KEYHOLE,” which covers intelligence-gathering satellites, are no longer treated as separate from each other officially and one will routinely see documents marked “TALENT KEYHOLE,” or using the abbreviation “TK,” as a single term. Nicknames As we briefly mentioned, when it comes to the designation of nicknames, NICKA offers some flexibility and gives military commanders the ability to be a little more creative. Whereas NICKA only assigns single-word code words, by policy, nicknames must be comprised of two separate words. Similar to the code word process, each DoD component agency is assigned a set of designated numerical block assignments by NICKA. In turn, the agency’s numerical block assignment will correspond to “alphabetical assignment list,” which is a range of two-letter alphabetical sets. The first word of any nickname must come from within an agency’s assigned alphabetical range. For example, using the now obsolete and unclassified NICKA block assignments, if a program within the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) needed to come up with a nickname, one would start by identifying the four numerical blocks assigned to the DIA (15, 33, 51, and 76). US Government document The next step would be identifying what ranges of two-letter combinations would be associated with an agency’s assigned blocks. Following along with the previous example, based on the alphabetical assignment list, the first word of a DIA program nickname would have to start with: Block 15 – Letters DM – DR Block 33 – Letters IA – IF Block 51 – Letters MM-MR Block 76 – Letters SS – SZ US Government document Once the alphabetical block assignments are determined, for military commanders, the process then becomes a word-search of sorts in order to come up with an appropriate first word for a nickname that fits within the designated letter combinations. In our example, the words “DOOM,” “IDEAL,” “MOON,” or “STEREO” would all fit the criteria as being acceptable first words for a DIA nickname. Below is a more specific set of examples straight from the U.S. Central Command’s (CENTCOM) regulation regarding NICKA: CENTCOM via FOIA When it comes to the second portion of the two-word requirement for nicknames, military planners have the unrestricted ability to get creative, provided phrases are not “improper” or “counterproductive.” By NICKA guidelines, improper nicknames would be terms that are: Inconsistent with traditional American ideals or current foreign policy. Offensive to good taste or derogatory to a particular group, sect, or creed. Offensive to U.S. allies or other free world nations. Additionally, NICKA forbids nicknames from being: Any two-word combination voice call sign found in the Joint Army Navy Air Force Publication Call Sign Book (JANAP-119). Include the words, “Project, Exercise, or Operation.” Words that may be used correctly either as a single word or as two words, such as “moonlight.” Exotic words, trite expressions or well-known commercial trademarks. By military standards—where one can often find rules for rules—NICKA guidelines on nicknames are fairly limited and debatably common sense. Thanks to the tempered flexibility NICKA gives to nicknames, the system still affords for some bellicose poetry like “Beast Master” —a 2006 Army operation to clear the Baghdad suburb of Ghazaliya—an area itself (unofficially) nicknamed “IED Alley East,” or “Viking Snatch” —a 2007 counterinsurgency operation in Iraq. Still, especially at lower levels of command and for short-duration operations, one still often sees nicknames that do not comply with NICKA, including ones with single words. Photograph taken during Operation Beastmaster, December 2006., US Army In contrast to code words, nicknames, including their descriptions, meanings, and relationship, are also, by policy, supposed to remain unclassified, though the branches of the U.S. military still routinely classify them on the ground of national security. In addition, NICKA guidelines stipulate nicknames are not required, but can be assigned to actual real-world events, projects, or activities. One caveat to “not required” being with Special Access Programs , which are required to have an unclassified nickname assigned to them. Exercise Terms Rounding out NICKA’s trifecta of officially sanctioned phrases, are exercise terms. As the name implies, exercise terms are monikers assigned to tests, drills, or exercises, which are assigned for the purpose of emphasizing the event is not an actual real-world operation. That said, the military has a bad habit of not sticking to DoD rules when it comes to publicizing or describing training exercises, often describing them as “operations.” For example, “Llama Fury” was a week-long Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) training exercise at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in late summer of 2015. By NICKA policies, Llama Fury should have carried the “exercise” moniker. However, in press releases, multiple Air Force Public Affairs Offices described the event as “Operation Llama Fury.” Though technically their own classification, exercise terms are more or less an extension of NICKA nicknames, with their selection and regulation falling under the same agency assigned alphabetical block system as the nicknaming process. Since some military training evolutions are regularly repeated, certain specific exercises will carry the same name with an added numerical postfix indicating the month or year the event occurs. For example, held annually from 2006 to 2018, some of the largest U.S. military war games ever performed in the Pacific Ocean were all conducted under the exercise term “Valiant Shield.” Since this training event was repeated for twelve-years, a four-digit identifier for the year training maneuvers were performed would accompany the exercise term, producing “ Exercise Valiant Shield 2017, ” and so on and so forth. Exercise Valiant Shield 2017. , US Navy For exercises that occur multiple times in a fiscal year, like “ Swift Response ,” a large training event between the U.S. and its European allies, the second iteration of the exercise in 2017 would be called “Swift Response 17-2.” Least ambiguous of NICKA’s trio, code words play an essential role safeguarding extremely sensitive secrets. However, when it comes to nicknames and exercise terms, this aspect of NICKA is arguably more significant. For example, “Enduring Freedom,” (the U.S. Global War on Terrorism, though often applied solely to operations in Afghanistan), “Iraqi Freedom,” (the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation), or “Inherent Resolve,” (the U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS), are not merely nicknames, these phrases are meant to inspire and express the overarching intent of military involvement. More than just iconic inscriptions on military ribbons, medals, and service records, the perceptions associated with a few major military nicknames or terms become ingrained in the public’s collective conscious and often end up being enduring aspects of American history. So, there you have it. All those cool-sounding program nicknames, secretive code words, and intense sounding military exercises you probably heard of over the years, all likely came from a highly structured, yet obscure Department of Defense system puzzlingly named NICKA.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 6, 2019",These Images Of An F-22 Raptor’s Crumbling Radar Absorbent Skin Are Fascinating,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-22 Raptor was a highlight of this year’s EAA Airventure Air Show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Raptor Demo Team flew in aircraft that were from Langely AFB in Virginia, where the team is based. One of those jets showed comparatively extreme signs of corrosion on the upper nose area, right before the canopy. In fact, the section was in such poor shape, that it offered a bizarre and fascinating view of what some of the F-22’s most prominent surface areas are made up of. As you can see in the images, it’s not just that the surface is corroded, it appears that areas of the radar-absorbent material (RAM) beneath it has fallen away entirely. It almost looks like there are gaping holes in the jet’s upper nose, but that may not actually be the case. If you look closely, it seems like there may be a translucent coating in place over the area that creates a shell or sorts that laminates to the foam-like structure below. Still, the F-22’s nose looks somewhat hollow inside. Even the AN/AAR-56 missile launch warning system aperture appears to be at least partially ‘floating’ on this shell-like arrangement. If these were holes and open to the air, one would think the section would quicky rip apart while the jet was underway and cause negative aerodynamic and buffeting effects, as well as other issues. Regardless, we are looking at truly amazing material and construction science that appears downright alien when compared to that of non-stealthy fighters. Reader submission Reader submission Reader submission Reader submission Much of what makes up and lies beneath the F-22 Raptor’s silver skin remains a tightly guarded secret. The aircraft’s outer mold-line is a mosaic of radar-absorbent coatings and radar transparent and radar defeating composite structures that combine to allow the Raptor to remain aerodynamically efficient while also largely invisible to fire control radars. All this takes a lot of work to maintain and many of these applications start degrading shortly after they are applied, with friction from high-speed flight, crushing G forces, and the elements accelerating that process. As such, one of the costliest aspects of operating F-22s—and flying this aircraft is extremely expensive with an average flight hour cost of about $60k—is keeping its stealthy skin up to par. This also is a major contributor to its fairly abysmal mission capable rate of around 50 percent. For aircraft that aren’t headed into combat or high-end training scenarios, maintaining the jet’s stealthy skin isn’t as high of a priority. There are different standards of readiness for F-22 skins to be kept at depending on the situation, with its effectiveness slipping a certain percentage before needing time-consuming reapplication. For instance, for a jet that could see combat or is needed for high-end testing and training that will leverage its full capabilities, degradation of less than 10 percent could trigger the need to reapplication and servicing. For a jet used for training new F-22 pilots, that percentage could be far greater. Senior Airman Joshua Moon, 192nd Fighter Wing stated the following in a USAF news item about maintaining the F-22’s stealthy skin during Red Flag: “We knew they were going to fly the hell out of the jets because this is a large-scale exercise… When the pilot flies he’ll bank real hard sometimes, which can tear or rip the radar absorbent material. If there are a lot of damages, the aircraft is easier to detect, so we try to keep those damages to a minimum to where you can’t see it on radar. … When other people have problems with a jet, it’s going to affect LO… Right now, something is wrong with a light panel on that jet. Since maintenance needs to get into that panel, we have to pick the radar absorbent material off and clean all the fasteners out so they can fix the light. Once the light is fixed we will re-bind the coating and material again to make it 100 percent ready. … At Red Flag, they’re testing our jets by hitting them with radar over the range, so that’s a lot of pressure for us – it’s really important that those jets come back undetected.” A USAF low observable maintenance tech, better known as a “Martian,” works on an F-22’s empennage., USAF Clearly, performing at air shows doesn’t require any stealth at all. In fact, the jets wear bolt-on radar-reflecting lenses so that their radar cross-section appears large on air traffic control radars. So, it makes sense to send jets that are not fresh out of low-observables servicing for such tasks and using those that are for more challenging and pressing missions. In addition, roughly a third of the relatively tiny F-22 fleet is not combat coded at any given time. Older models that have not been upgraded to latest block configurations are used for training and in some cases testing. Once again, these aircraft would likely have a lower priority for keeping their stealth cloak in check than their front-line counterparts. Aircraft that are based in more corrosive environments, such as humid areas or those near salty sea air, or where rain and cold are a constant reality, can see accelerated degradation of the low observable treatments. Langley sits right next to the Atlantic Ocean and would definitely challenge maintainers more than say aircraft that are based in the dry desert at Nellis AFB. But even the desert can take its toll on the Raptor’s skin, especially the blowing sands of the Middle East. The F-35 was designed with new LO skin treatments in mind that significantly reduce the time it takes to keep it in tip-top shape. But still, the newer stealth fighter gobbles up man-hours dealing with its stealth coatings and coverings. The F-22 has had new technologies and materials integrated into its skin over time, as well, including some of the advances baked in (literally in some cases) to the F-35, but it still takes a lot of work to keep the jets in their most stealthy configuration. USAF A USAF news piece about the LO maintainers at Tyndall AFB talks about the process of keeping the jets’ low observable, and in some cases highly toxic , exotic sheathing up: “Each week, LO does outer mold line inspections. This involves checking each jet’s signature, which makes an aircraft appear on detection devices. A very high signature equals a very low stealth capability leaving the jet exposed to radar. “It is extremely essential. Being invisible is priceless in combat situations,” said Scott Christian, DS2 Aircraft Maintenance supervisor. The OML helps determine where the jets sit in margin, the range of stealth capability that the aircraft need to be, and allows LO to identify the damages to the coating. When an aircraft is selected for a major signature reduction, it is in need of around 150 necessary repairs on about 30 different panels. These repairs can take up to three weeks to complete. “We do everything from major three week repairs to what we call spike maintenance, which is just over a weekend,” Sergeant Stovall said. … “The first step is always going to be to mask the aircraft, to ensure sanding debris is contained,” said Staff Sgt. Armando Castellon, 325th MXS Low Observable Signatures coordinator. This step keeps from spreading the contamination of hazardous chemicals associated with working with the LO coatings. Next, the maintainers remove the damaged areas by sanding and then thoroughly cleaning those sanded areas to ensure a proper bonding of the coatings. Once that is complete, LO reapplies the coatings starting with the boot layer, which is the radar absorbent material that allows for stealth capabilities. The additional top coats of paint follow. The jet is then removed from the system to avoid confusion. One of the biggest obstacles the group face while applying the coatings is the Florida weather. Lighting within five miles of the base halts all flight line activities, including LO restorations taking place there, and the humidity and temperature levels makes it difficult to get a proper bond with the coatings, Sergeant Castellon said. “When working with low observable material, everything deals with chemicals, and a lot of chemicals are required to stay within a certain temperature and humidity range to get the best bond,” said Sergeant Stovall. “Here in Florida, we have a tremendous level of humidity. If we have one of those high humidity days when these guys are doing repairs, it is very possible there will be a disbond in the material just because environmental controls aren’t where they need to be.” To counter these conditions, LO has two climate controlled bays that are the ideal location for restorations, but due to constant need of LO restoration, these bays are never empty. During a week, the team continually work on six jets, which increases to eight to 10 during weekends. This does not include the flight line dispatch work they do.” It’s amazing to think that the powerful lines of the F-22 that we have come so familiar with are really just a cloak that conceals the aircraft beneath it. As these photos prove, when it comes to the Raptor, there is so much more than meets the eye and we may never really know anywhere near all of its shrouded secrets nor much about shrouds themselves that conceal them.

Chris Harmer,"Posted on Jul 9, 2019",Here’s Why Naval Convoys Are An Ideal Solution Hated By Everyone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, proposed a “ European led maritime protection mission ” in response to Iranian aggression in the Persian Gulf. If you are wondering what a European led maritime protection mission looks like, you are not alone. I have talked to a dozen or so naval strategists over the last few days, and nobody is quite sure what he is talking about. The feedback I got was clear on two points, however. First, the Royal Navy (RN), while qualitatively one of the best navies in the world, does not have the force structure required to provide constant security and coverage to all British flagged commercial ships operating in the Persian Gulf on an enduring basis. Yes, the Royal Navy might escort and protect a single ship or two through the Strait of Hormuz, but protecting all British flagged commercial ships over the long term is another case entirely. Second, beyond the short term protection that the RN is able to provide, whatever this larger protection mission winds up being, it may not end up looking like a traditional convoy system. Why? Because every relevant stakeholder in this drama hates convoys. Tankers Are The Perfect Target While commercial ships come in all shapes and sizes, tankers carrying crude oil and refined petrochemical products have some characteristics in common. They have vast holding tanks, which increases economies of scale. They are highly automated and minimally manned, which decreases operating costs. These design parameters result in commercial tankers being large, slow, difficult to maneuver, and easy to detect both visually and by radar, which makes them extremely easy for malign actors to target or seize. This is not a new development. Because of their economic value during peacetime and their industrial utility during wartime, commercial ships, especially oil and petrochemical tankers, have always been high-value targets. U.S. Navy cruiser patrols an oil terminal in the Persian Gulf., USN Iran Attacks and Seizes Tankers Over the past several months, the Islamic Republic of Iran has conducted a number of destabilizing attacks against maritime commercial shipping in the Middle East. These attacks have ranged from kinetic operations, including an alleged attempt to sink or severely damage two petrochemical tankers , to harassment of shipping engaged in navigation through the Strait of Hormuz (SOH) , to the outright seizure of the Stena Impero , a British flagged crude oil tanker. The geographical dispersion of these and previous Iranian operations ranges from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman, and as far as the Gulf of Aden, the Strait of Bab El Mandeb and the Red Sea. This shows the reach of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (IRIN), the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy (IRGCN), and the IRGC’s Quds Force, which trains shore-based proxies of Iran, including the Houthi rebels of Yemen. It’s All About The Benjamins There are a lot of plausible reasons behind Iran’s provocative and destabilizing behavior, but the most obvious cause is the Iranian regime’s dire financial situation. While the United States has always had some form of sanctions imposed against Iran since the revolution of 1979, it’s fair to say that the current program of “maximum pressure” sanctions is more comprehensive and uniformly enforced than at any point during the last 40 years. The sanctions are imposing a severe cost on the Iranian economy, as formally declared oil exports have shrunk to less than 500,000 barrels per day (BPD). As recently as October of 2016, Iran was exporting over 3,000,000 BPD. To be clear, this is not just a U.S. program of sanctions. The European Union (EU) has its own set of sanctions that have impacted Iran, including in indirect ways. Enforcing sanctions on Syria, a major Iranian ally, was the primary cause of the U.K. seizing the Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 . As a result of the decrease in oil exports, the Iranian regime has experienced a massive reduction in revenue. Iran is in desperate need of increased cash flow, both for legitimate domestic expenditures for basic governmental functions inside Iran and to support its illegitimate international operations, including propping up the Assad regime in Syria, subsidizing Hezbollah in Lebanon, supplying surface to surface rockets to Hamas in Gaza, and its support for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Of particular concern in the context of maritime security is the fact that Iran is supplying cruise missiles and explosive-laden remote-controlled boats to Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Houthis have been particularly active. Not content with targeting just commercial shipping , they have also targeted Saudi naval vessels , Emirati supply ships , and even U.S. Navy warships . Iran has a large collection of diverse naval assets that work in and around the Strait of Hormuz, including diesel-electric submarines. , AFP/Getty Images Iran’s Objectives By destabilizing the security situation for commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf, Iran hopes to achieve two separate, but related outcomes. First, in the near term, Iran hopes to see an increase in the price of oil. Second, over the long run, Iran hopes to demonstrate that it is the dominant regional power in the Middle East and use that status as negotiating leverage in order to reduce sanctions. In this scenario, Iran would offer to guarantee the security of commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz in return for reduced sanctions. While the first outcome, an increase in oil prices, is plausible and perhaps even likely, the second outcome, relief of sanctions, looks increasingly unrealistic. The U.S. is committed to the maximum pressure approach and will be for the foreseeable future. By seizing a British flagged tanker, Iran has made a rapprochement with the European Union (EU) much less likely, as well. Convoys Are The Perfect Technical Solution At the beginning of this article, we talked about why oil and petrochemical tankers are easy targets, they are large, slow, difficult to maneuver, easy to detect and worth a lot of money. Iran has targeted tankers for attacks, harassment, and seizure. There is no reason to suspect this behavior will stop anytime soon. Fortunately, there is a tried and true solution that has proven throughout history to be very effective. Convoys of merchant vessels, guarded by relatively few military ships, have been used for the better part of a thousand years to offer protection. Convoys were used extensively by the Royal Navy to great effect during the Napoleonic Wars. During World War I, less than 1% of merchant vessels that sailed across the Atlantic as part of the American and British convoys were lost to German submarine attacks. While the German surface raiders and U-boats of World War II were significantly more capable than their predecessors, the convoy system operated by Allied fleets resulted in the successful delivery of hundreds of millions of tons of cargo to Great Britain and the Soviet Union. From a supply and logistics perspective, it is beyond dispute that the strategic bombing campaign against Nazi Germany, the Russian offensive on the Eastern Front, and the landings in North Africa, Italy, and at Normandy would have been categorically impossible without the convoy system delivering the food, raw materials, and finished products required for these operations. Convoys were the essential logistical element of victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. An Atlantic convoy during WWII seen from a Sunderland flying boat. , Public Domain Operation Earnest Will Convoys are not merely a relic of wars past. A major component of the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s was the so-called “Tanker War” that resulted in over 450 commercial ships being hit. Iran targeted ships owned, flagged, or operated by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in retaliation for their financial support to Iraq. In response, the U.S. Navy initiated Operation Earnest Will in 1987, the largest convoy operation since World War II. During this operation, Kuwaiti and Saudi vessels were “reflagged” to U.S. merchant status, and the U.S. Navy began escorting convoys out of the northern and central Persian Gulf ports through the Strait of Hormuz. Once far enough outside the Persian Gulf to be protected from Iranian attacks, the convoys would disband, and inbound empty tankers would form up into a convoy to go back through the Strait into the Persian Gulf. Operation Earnest Will lasted from July 1987 to September 1988 and was a major factor in forcing Iran to accept a negotiated end to the Iran-Iraq War. From a technical perspective, convoys are an obvious “off the shelf” solution to the current problem that could be implemented in very short order. Why Hasn’t The Convoy Solution Been Invoked? At this point, you might be wondering why the convoy solution hasn’t already been embraced. Given that the Iranian threat to commercial shipping is realistic and enduring and given that the convoy system is a tried and true solution to the problem, what is keeping the U.S. Navy and its allies in the Persian Gulf from offering convoys up to commercial shipping? Why haven’t the commercial shipping lines requested or even demanded this solution be promulgated as soon as possible? To be clear, the United Kingdom is proposing a European-centric “maritime protection mission” in response to the seizure of Stena Impero . The exact nature of this nascent maritime protection mission might wind up looking very similar to a convoy system, but then again, it might not. While convoys are proven concept, unless they are in response to a shooting war, both navies and commercial shipping companies really dislike using them. For a recent example of this, we can look to the problem of Somali piracy and how, despite an enduring threat that lasted about a decade and resulted in hundreds of attacks, both navies and commercial shipping companies resisted adopting convoys. A tanker convoy during the Tanker Wars of the late 1980s., AFP/Stringer Convoys And Somali Piracy Pirates operating from the African continent are hardly a new problem. In fact, the first major foreign war fought by the United States following independence from Great Britain was the First Barbary War from 1801 to 1805 in response to pirates from the Barbary States of Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco preying on American commercial shipping in the Mediterranean. Almost exactly 200 years after defeating the Barbary pirates, the U.S. Navy was again confronted with the problem of piracy, this time originating from the failed state of Somalia. Starting in 2005, Somali pirates conducted hundreds of attacks against commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Sea, later extending the attack zone out in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. The economic impact was significant. Direct payments to the pirates between 2005 and 2012 totaled just under $400 million. Indirect costs were much higher, with estimates approaching $20 billion per year. Insurance rates for commercial ships skyrocketed. Shipping companies incurred significant fuel costs by routing ships further and further around the attack zones. Along with the fuel cost of rerouting ships, cargo brokers suffered from the increased time required to transit around the piracy zones. Yet even after a U.S. flagged ship, the MV Maersk Alabama , was seized by Somali pirates, both commercial shippers and the U.S. and allied navies resisted adopting a convoy system to prevent attacks. There was no technical reason to avoid convoys, but there were financial and operations reasons to reject the convoy option. USN Shipping Companies Hate The Cost Of Convoys The modern shipping industry is extremely competitive and efficient. One of the ways that modern shipping norms are more efficient than in years past is the quick turnaround time typically experienced in modern ports. Shipowners want the ships to pull into port, discharge cargo, load cargo, and get underway again as soon as possible. A ship and crew pushing cargo from port-to-port is generating revenue. A ship sitting in port is only generating costs. Under normal transit procedures, as soon as an oil tanker loads up, at, say, the Saudi port of Ras Tanura in the Persian Gulf, it can immediately depart for its offload port. If that tanker has to wait to sail until a convoy forms up, that delay imposes an immense cost on the shipowner. Ships are like any major capital investment, most of them are purchased with a combination of equity investment and debt financing. Equity investors expect a return on their investment, and debt financiers expect their interest payments to be made on time. Ships sitting around empty—or worse, ships that are full of a cargo that has been purchased, but now sits idly, getting no closer to the destination and paying customers—generate a lot of costs, but no revenue. Ultimately, shipowners, operators, investors in shipping companies, and debt financiers despise the idea of waiting around for convoys to form up. Their view is, a convoy might prevent an attack by Somali pirates or Iranian terrorists, but it absolutely will impose additional significant costs. Modern Navies Hate Convoys More Than Shipping Companies Do The term asymmetric warfare has been overused to the point of exhaustion, but the case of a modern navy operating a convoy system in order to protect commercial ships from a ragtag collection of pirates running around in fishing boats with rusty AK-47s and second-hand Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPG) is about as clear an example of asymmetric conflict as one could imagine. This is true both for the equipment that would be used as well as for the missions that would be curtailed in order to resource a convoy system. In terms of equipment, the U.S. Navy surface combatants that would be used in a convoy system are primarily Ticonderoga class cruisers and Arleigh Burke class destroyers, supplemented by Cyclone class patrol ships and even smaller vessels. These cruisers and destroyers are extremely expensive and capable ships. To any foe, a brand new Arleigh Burke class destroyer is a one ship nightmare waiting to happen, armed with a dazzling array of weapons, including 5-inch guns, Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of hitting targets a thousand miles away with pinpoint accuracy, SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 guided missiles that can engage manned aircraft, unmanned drones, ballistic missiles, and even satellites, as well as close-in weapon systems, smaller guns, and two MH-60R helicopters with all their sensors and weapons. No matter how you calculate the price tag, a fully manned, trained, and armed Arleigh Burke class destroyer costs well over two billion dollars. The fishing skiffs that Somali pirates use are maybe worth $10,000, at the most. The modified speedboats that the Iranians use to harass, attack, or seize commercial ships are certainly more advanced and expensive than Somali pirate vessels, but an entire flotilla of IRGCN speedboats modified with short-range missiles and guns costs less than a single Arleigh Burke class destroyer. USN While the U.S. Navy Cyclone class patrol ships are a more cost appropriate platform to deter harassment and attacks by Iranian gunboats, neither they nor the smaller still Mark VI patrol boats have adequate Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) bandwidth to lead a convoy, nor do they have adequate range to escort a convoy without refueling, in many cases. Both the Cyclone patrol ships and Mark VI patrol boats would clearly be part of a convoy protection system, but either a cruiser or destroyer would have to lead the convoy and Cyclone and Mark VI hulls may need to be refueled at sea during the convoy transit, which would add an additional complicating factor. From an operational perspective, the mismatch is even more glaring than the financial considerations. Navy surface combatants in the Middle East have two operational commitments that dwarf all others. First, protecting the carriers from anti-ship cruise missiles. While Navy carriers have some point defense systems, they are designed to operate in concert with cruisers and destroyers that push the defensive envelope out to well over a hundred miles. Second, to provide ballistic missile defense capabilities to U.S. and allied forces in the Middle East. If these extremely capable, extremely expensive Navy ships are playing sheepdog to a convoy of slow oil tankers, they can’t protect the carriers or provide ballistic missile defense. The Cyclone patrol ships and Mark VI patrol boats are equally task saturated, albeit with different missions, more of a Special Operations Forces (SOF) support angle. Suffice to say, every Navy ship in the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) has plenty of existing missions to attend other than escorting a convoy. Bottom line, both commercial shipping owners/operators and modern navies hate the convoy system, and both hate it for the costs it imposes. As a side note, at this point you might wonder, what about the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)? The LCS was conceived for exactly this type of mission, shallow water operations in a low-intensity conflict zone. LCS hulls are big enough to run an entire convoy route without refueling and have adequate C3I bandwidth to lead a convoy. At less than half the size of an AlreighBurke class destroyer, the LCS is just big enough to play mother goose to a convoy, without wasting a lot of excess capacity. Sounds perfect, right? Well, the LCS would be a perfect fit for running convoys if it were deployable and fit for even low-intensity conflict zones. Regrettably, the LCS has earned its nickname of “Little Crappy Ship” by failing to meet many of its operational performance objectives or timelines. Forget deploying to a combat zone, or even a low-intensity conflict zone. The LCS fleet, and there is a fleet now, has barely been able to deploy to friendly foreign ports in recent years. Suffice to say the LCS is in this circumstance, as it has been since the first ship was commissioned in 2008, relatively irrelevant, except to the extensive damage it has done to the Navy budget and the burden it has placed on other ships that have to fill the gaps left by the nearly non-deployable LCS. A U.S. Navy Avenger class minesweeper takes part in an international convoy exercise in the Persian Gulf. , USN So What Happened To The Somali Piracy Problem? In terms of deterring (no, not defeating—they are never defeated) Somali pirates, the resolution was provided by a combination of solutions that were implemented over a long timeline. First, the U.S. and allied countries focused more on addressing security and governance issues on the landward side of the problem. While Somalia has been, at some level, a failed state for the better part of three decades, there are pockets of security and good governance. The U.S. and partners began working more closely with local institutions to deliver better security and governance, thus blunting some of the root causes of piracy. Second, merchant ships began employing security contractors onboard. Pirates are fundamentally just thieves looking for an easy payday. The last thing pirates want is to try and seize a ship that is defended by professional security operatives. Third, the U.S. and partner navies started Operation Ocean Shield that targeted pirate vessels, particularly “motherships” that were used to stage further attacks, for inspection and seizure. Between improved security and governance in Somalia, security personnel on the commercial vessels, and the presence of warships operating in a coordinated fashion, the Somali piracy problem was gradually suppressed, if not solved nearly in full. By 2013, there were no successful seizures of large commercial ships by Somali pirates. To be clear, the problem has been suppressed, not eliminated, and could reappear in short order if conditions degrade, but for now, there is only a very limited threat to commercial shipping from Somali pirates. Does Today’s Announcement Change Anything? Today’s announcement by the British government that the RN would escort any British flagged vessels through the Strait of Hormuz contained two caveats. First, the escort is limited to the Strait. Second, the escort will only happen if the shipowner gives the RN “sufficient notice…of their passage.” Regarding the location, the easiest place for Iran to harass, attack, or seize ships is in the Strait of Homruz, but it is hardly the only place. It’s just under 400 nautical miles from Bandar Abbas, Iran, located in the middle of the Strait, to Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia. Iran could easily choose to forego operations in the Strait and attack elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. Additionally, Iran has access to the terrain in Yemen currently occupied by the Houthi rebels. That includes well over 100 nautical miles of coastline on the Red Sea. Point being, the RN can provide security in the Strait of Hormuz. It can’t provide security for the entire region. Regarding the timing, the RN can provide security in the Strait of Hormuz, if ship owners give sufficient notice. How much notice? Well, it seems inevitable that the notification will eventually flow from the RN to the shipping companies. In all likelihood, the RN will be forced to establish a schedule of Strait transits and commercial ships will have to adhere to that schedule if they want to be escorted through. This will, of course, impose operational limitations on the limited in size and overtasked RN. If the RN is busy escorting commercial ships through the Strait of Hormuz, the RN is tied to the Strait and to the schedule of transits. And, of course, it will impose financial costs on the ship owners, because regardless of what the optimal scheduling is for any individual commercial ship, if it wants protection and escort through the Strait, it will have to adhere to the RN schedule of transits. Ultimately, Iran has succeeded in imposing a substantial operational and opportunity cost on the RN, and a large financial cost on British flagged shipping. Will The Iranians Stop Their Attacks? The solution to Somali piracy was never a mystery, it was just difficult, expensive, and slow to implement. Even though Somali pirates were a ragtag collection of loosely affiliated criminal networks, it still took the United States the better part of a decade to come up with a coherent framework to deal with the problem. In contrast, Iran is the largest, most capable, wealthiest state sponsor of terror in the world with hundreds of thousands of loyal, disciplined, and well-trained followers at its disposal. Iran has been fighting a proxy civil war in Syria for the better part of a decade and in Yemen for half that time. They know how to plan for long-duration missions. If they want to keep attacking commercial shipping the Persian Gulf, they have the stamina to wait until the circumstances are ideal for their next hit. Bottom line, there is no obvious offramp to further belligerent behavior by the Iranian regime. Neither the United States nor the EU is going to relieve sanctions on Iran, or its foreign partners, anytime soon, so further escalation, while not inevitable, is certainly likely. The European maritime mission that the United Kingdom is proposing will inevitably have to look something like a convoy in order to work. At this point, any commercial ships traveling solo into or out of the Strait of Hormuz is a viable target for the IRGCN. With this in mind, the only thing that seems certain at this point is that some form of convoys—the ideal solution that is hated by both the navies that run them and shipping companies—will probably start operating in the near future. What exactly it will look like or how well it will be adhered to and last is anyone’s guess. Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com Chris Harmer Contributor"
Tim McMillan and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Special Access Programs And The Pentagon’s Ecosystem Of Secrecy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To a lot of people, terms like “black budget,” or “black projects,” inspire dark imagery of government figures operating in contrast to the principles of a free and open society. Indeed, with tens of billions set aside every year for classified Pentagon programs and operations, it would be reckless of the public not to be willing to question that which they pay for, but lack the privilege of knowing anything about. Inherently enigmatic and often grossly misunderstood, The War Zone set out to shed light on the obscure processes that are involved in maintaining the highly intricate ecosystem that works to guard the Pentagon’s most closely held secrets. Special Access Programs—A Hidden World Most Will Never See For the better part of the last twenty-five years, the manner in which the U.S. government safeguards and restricts access of highly classified information is through a set of compartmentalization protocols termed “Special Access Programs.” Thanks to the government’s love affair with condensing words, most people are likely familiar with this formalized system of security’s acronym—”SAP.” For most of us stuck on the outside trying to get an idea of what’s inside, the term “Special Access Program” is often misunderstood as being itself a classification level. In truth, SAPs are merely a set of security protocols limiting access of sensitive information to only authorized and necessary individuals. Cue the cliché, “That information is need to know, and you don’t have a need to know!” Now, before one can gain a real appreciation for how Special Access Programs operate, like any scholar of history will tell you, “To understand the present, one must first appreciate the past.” Top Secret cover sheet circa 1967., CIA How National Security Information Is Classified The early origins of Special Access Programs can be traced to March 22, 1940, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8381, creating for the first time, three security designations for America’s most crucial information—restricted, confidential, and secret. In the ensuing years, various presidential executive orders have tweaked how the government designates classified information. The current levels of classification are confidential, secret, and top secret. The determining factor for how information is classified depends on how much damage an unauthorized disclosure would reasonably be expected to cause. Top Secret: “Exceptionally grave damage to national security.” Secret: “Serious damage to national security.” Confidential: “Damage to national security.” Important to note, established through the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the Department of Energy (DOE) uses two differing equivalent levels of security clearance. Q-Clearance: Equivalent to a Top-Secret level clearance. L-Clearance: Equivalent to a Secret level clearance. For clarity’s sake, at times misrepresented by the entertainment industry, a “Yankee White clearance” is not an actual security clearance. “Yankee White” is an administrative nickname for the background check performed for persons who will work within close proximity to the President or Vice President. According to Department of Defense instructions , to obtain a Yankee White clearance one must pass the same Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) necessary for a top secret clearance, and establish “unquestionable loyalty to the United States.” Within the world of SAPs, a program can involve information from any one of these official classification levels. Further adding to the confusion, in many cases, a single Special Access Program will contain multiple components, each with differing classification levels. The Dubious Origins Of Special Access Programs The incredulous mystique surrounding SAPs likely comes from the unofficial, ad hoc nature of their origins. In 1953, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued Executive order 10501 , he eliminated classification authority from 28 government entities, limiting only departments and agencies of the executive branch the ability to classify materials. More importantly, President Eisenhower’s directive removed the previously approved “restricted” designation. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Oval Office. , Eisenhower Library Up to this point, “restricted” classifications functioned as a means of limiting certain information from people who may indeed have held an active security clearance, however, they didn’t have a “need to know.” In light of being given a formal order by the Commander and Chief, some departments within the Pentagon weren’t all that keen on being unable to limit access to their secrets. In response, many agencies began to unofficially use “special access.” Albeit, with no official authority, these informal “special access” classifications would allow for the continuance of closely guarded, tight-knit programs, to be hidden within the government. Now, it’s hard to argue that the flagrant rejection of national directives wasn’t a recipe for disaster waiting to happen. In fact, it’s likely no coincidence some of the darkest times in government secrecy went on during these unofficial “special access” years. For example, the CIA’s infamous Project MKULtra began in 1953 and remained active until 1973. Coincidently, 1973 was the same year that during an oversight hearing, a report by the Committee on Government Operations brought to light that dozens of unauthorized “special access, distribution, control labels, stamps, or markings” were being used, by “many executive agencies having classification authority and dozens of other agencies who do not possess such authority.” In all fairness, by the time of their discovery, the precedent of unofficial special access programs was primarily a moot point. Either intentionally or by ironic happenstance, three months prior to five men being caught breaking into the Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington D.C., on March 8, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed Executive order 11652 , legitimatizing and establishing the overall framework for what would eventually become the “Special Access Program” of today. President Nixon in the Oval Office., National Archives Still not thoroughly having worked the kinks out, according to the Center for Development of Security Excellence’s (CDSE) Special Access Programs Training Course, from the early 1970s to 1980s, SAPs—referenced even within the government as “black programs,”—were almost exclusively restricted to safeguarding DoD acquisition programs. In fact, the existence of “black programs” wasn’t publicly known until the mid-1980s, when the controversial “Project Yellow Fruit” unceremoniously thrust government secrecy programs in the limelight. More on “Project Yellow Fruit” to come. By the mid-1990s, these enigmatic workshops shed the “black program” moniker, opting to go by the more contemporarily familiar “Special Access Program.” In addition to the more dexterously sleek title, intelligence, operations, and support programs were added to the SAP repertoire, establishing the Special Access Program regime we’ve come to know today. Armed with some history on SAP’s, let’s take a look at how they operate. Enter the Bureaucratic Jungle of SAPs When considering the term “special access program,” typically, people envision one of the three categories that go on within the Department of Defense, as outlined by DoD 5205.07. Acquisition, intelligence, and operations and support. Breaking these categories down to gain a sense of what they entail: Acquisition SAPs: Programs that involve research, development, testing, modification, evaluation or procurement of new technologies. (According to the CDSE, Acquisition SAPs make up 75-80% of all DoD SAPs) Intelligence SAPs: Planning and execution of, especially sensitive, intelligence or counter-intelligence operations. Operations and Support SAPs: Planning, implementation, and support of sensitive military activities. It’s important to note, though the DoD’s three main categories are the most well-known, Special Access Programs are inherently just a procedure within the government. In fact, there are many other categories of SAPs that go on outside the DoD. For example, the Secret Service’s Presidential travel support detail is technically a SAP. Additionally, within the intelligence services, these similar sets of protocols are termed, “Sensitive Compartmented Information” (SCI) and not “Special Access Programs.” Additionally, separate from an objective category, all special access programs fall under one of two distinctive protection levels—”acknowledged” and “unacknowledged.” Acknowledged SAPs – Programs that’s existence and purpose can be openly recognized. With Acknowledged SAPs, typically only intimate details, such as technologies, materials or techniques are kept secret. Funding for Acknowledged SAPs is mostly unclassified and can be readily seen in the government’s fiscal budget. With its existence well known, yet its inner details still remaining mysterious, Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Raider is an excellent example of an Acknowledged Special Access Program actively going on today. On the other end of the spectrum, serving as the inspiration for much spy fiction or conspiracy theories of secret space forces, there is the “Unacknowledged” SAP. Unacknowledged SAPs or “USAPs”: The shy sibling of the SAP family. When a SAP is designated as “unacknowledged” not only is a program’s purpose carefully guarded, as the name implies, USAPs mere existence may be denied to everyone but a spare few who aren’t a part of the program. Given their shadowy presence, it should come as no surprise, the funding for unacknowledged SAPs is either classified or is intentionally hidden within the Federal budget. An example of an Unacknowledged SAP would be the RQ-170 before it was officially disclosed to the public. In rare instances, when information is considered to be of the most extremely sensitive in nature, the Secretary of Defense can formally exempt a program from federal reporting requirements and establish the pinnacle of the secrecy—the “Waived Unacknowledged SAP.” Due to their ultra-secretive nature, Unacknowledged or Waived-Unacknowledged SAPs, serve as fertile breeding grounds for conspiracies of hidden crashed UFO technology or veiled government “carve-outs” whereby the general public’s benefit is an afterthought. In truth, USAPs or Waived USAPs, like anything else that lacks accessibly verifiable fact, is likely very mythicized. With that said, like any good myth, there’s some truth and historical precedent that give legitimate reasons to be concerned with these deeply hidden programs. With that in mind, let’s take a quick journey back to the not-to-distant past. To a time that shows Special Access Programs have, and can, operate in a manner opposed to public interest. “Yellow Fruit,” The Rogue SAP The Government Wants To Forget In 1983, an arbitrary internal audit turned up enormous inconsistencies in an unacknowledged, covert SAP being run out of the newly formed Special Operations Division of the DoD. Code named, “Yellow Fruit,” the program was established to provide additional operational security and counter-intelligence assistance for missions in Central American. Yellow Fruit was a genuine “deep cover” USAP, with the program’s director, former Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Lt. Col. Dale Duncan outwardly appearing to have “retired” from the Army to start a private consulting firm called Business Security International. The discovery of financial discrepancies in Yellow Fruit sparked a formal investigation by the FBI. The inquiry into Yellow Fruit would result in Lt. Col. Duncan, Special Operation Division Commander Lt. Col. James E. Longhofer, and several other members of SOD being court-martialed for a hodgepodge of varying crimes. In addition, many never-fully proven allegations, such as millions of stolen dollars hidden in Swiss bank accounts , set-ups of other U.S. military officials with prostitutes and hidden cameras, and even ties to the Iran-Contra affair, still loom over Yellow Fruit. Nicaraguan Contra Rebels,1986. , Public Domain Though career military officers allowing their moral compasses to diverge from pointing ethically north is somberly disappointing, it’s regrettably far from unprecedented. Instead, what made Yellow Fruit such a significant turning point in the formative growth of current classified operations came from the embarrassing lack of DoD control and oversight that was revealed. As the rotting stench of Yellow Fruit made its way up the military hierarchy, top Army leadership, including Army Chief of Staff John Wickham and his Vice Maxwell Thurman, were stunned. The level of shock conveyed from the Pentagon’s leadership was understandable when you consider that in “The Dilemma of Covert Action,” published by the U.S. Army War College in 1989, it’s said none of the DoD brass had ever been briefed on the program and literally had no clue that a mere 15-minute drive from the Pentagon, tucked amongst a suite of commercial offices, a multi-million-dollar clandestine military operation was being run. Determining exactly what all went on within Project Yellow Fruit can prove to be a rather difficult task. Spare a few newspaper articles from the 1980s, publicly available information is extremely limited. With that said, the required CDSE’s training course for all persons participating in DoD SAPs, repeatedly mentions “Yellow Fruit” as being an inspiration for a wave of oversight and controls put in place to stem off the ability for a small group within government to literally go rogue. The Inner Workings of Special Access Programs In the Department of Defense’s mind-numbing behemoth of formal policies and directives, five volumes totaling 151 pages are now dedicated solely to Special Access Programs. Of course, if a light book’s worth of reading wasn’t enough, there are also specialized manuals for many divisions within the Pentagon that also provide their own expansive volume of rules and regulations. For example, there’s a Joint Army-Navy-Air Force SAP manual , offering service members of these three branches an extra 129 pages of supplemental reading. Lest we forget, since a significant amount of secret government activity is farmed out to private industry, government contractors who are involved with SAPs get their own 131 pages of “National Industrial Security Program” operating manual to peruse. Needless to say, though a considerable amount of government’s covert goings-on are indeed hidden from prying eyes, substantially more regulation and control have been implemented since the days when Project Yellow Fruit was turning in $56,000 receipts for desk calculators . A word of note before proceeding, for all those fans of flowcharts, this would be an excellent time to break out the markers and whiteboard, because as promised, no matter how “unconventional” SAPs may be, at the end of the day, they’re still subject to all of the customary administrative confusion that’s characteristic of civil service. Courtesy photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Brandan Schulze Special Access Program Central Offices Within the DoD, The Secretary or Under Secretary of Defense are the principal authorities for all Special Access Programs. Assisting the military’s Chief Executives in this endeavor involves a vast complex of ministerial powers. Serving on the front lines of the secrecy mosaic is the “Special Access Program Central Offices” (SAPCO). With a process that thrives on compartmentalization, it should come as no surprise, by “central” the DoD actually means there are three different types of SAP Central Offices residing in the corridors of the Pentagon—Component-Level SAPCOs, OSD-Level SAPCO, and DoD-Level SAPCO. Component-Level SAP Central Office (SAPCO): They can be found within each branch of the military, The Joint Chiefs of Staff, The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and The Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The Component-Level SAPCOs are responsible for initiating the prospective process for accessing the need for a Special Access Program. Once a SAP has been established, a Component-Level SAP Central Office serves as the hands-on manager for the SAPs that fall under their purview. Office of the Secretary of Defense-Level SAP Central Office (OSD SAPCO): Specifically established to assist the Deputy Secretary of Defense, The Office of the Secretary of Defense-Level Central Office serves as the oversight authority for all SAPs. Department of Defense SAP Central Office (DOD SAPCO): Serving to help streamline this entire fragmented and confusing process, the Department of Defense SAP Central Office functions as an ambassador by communicating and advising agencies of the executive branch and Congress on all issues relating to SAPs. Now if that wasn’t enough delegated authority for you, have no fear, because roaring alongside the SAP Central Offices like forking whitewater rapids of procedural hierarchy, comes the “SAP governance structure.” The Special Access Program Governance Structure Spearheading the SAP governance structure is the SAP Oversight Committee (SAPOC). Made up of a who’s who of Pentagon Under Secretaries, Vice Chiefs, and Assistant Directors, the Oversight Committee’s primary role is to advise and assist the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense in the governance, management, and oversight of all DoD Special Access Programs. Ensuring that the limitation of secrecy to only a select few isn’t a decision made in a vacuum, assisting the SAP Oversight Committee is: Senior Review Group (SRG): The principle working-level body who governs the process of SAP oversight. SAP Senior Working Group (SWG): Provides recommendations to the Senior Review Group and serves as a senior program protection forum coordinating, deconflicting, and integrating special programs. Pausing for a moment to take a breath, don’t put down those markers and flowchart just yet. As twisting and turning as all the aforementioned regulatory authorities might be, we’re far from having the whole picture of the Special Access Program process. The Importance Of Maintaining Secrecy In the late 1970’s NASA began operating an extensively modified Boeing 747 airliner to ferry the Space Shuttle around. By the late 1980s, two were in operation. Unimaginatively, these modified jumbo jets were called the “Shuttle Carrier Aircraft” (SCA) . SCA with an Orbiter on its back., NASA A decade after NASA began toting around the Space Shuttle Orbiter on the back of a wide-body plane, Russia started soaring through the skies in their brand new Antonov An-225 Mriya (meaning “dream” in English). Powered by six turbofan engines, the Mriya, to date, is the heaviest aircraft ever built. Oh, and as it happens, the Mriya was built to offer piggyback rides to Russia’s own space shuttle, the Buran. In case you don’t see where this is going, according to the Center For Development Security Excellence ( CDSE ), it was later determined Russia had “borrowed” technical information on the SCA to help develop their own massive orbiter transport aircraft. Protecting technological advancement isn’t just about maintaining military dominance. Instead, in terms of time and developmental dollars, the cost associated with the loss of industrial secrets can be enormous. When Russia “acquired” the fine technological details to develop the An-225 to carry their version of the Space Shuttle Orbiter, the Soviet Union effectively saved themselves considerable time and money at America’s expense. Noting only one Mriya has ever been built, the argument can be made, without the unwilling help of the U.S. aerospace industry, Russia’s shuttle ferry may never have entered operation.

June 12, 1989. , Master Sgt. Dave Casey/Public Domain. Ultimately, examples like Russia’s An-225 serve as distinct reminders that the most vital part of protecting national secrets doesn’t necessarily occur at desks and in boardrooms of the Pentagon. Instead, it goes on within the Special Access Programs themselves. Securing Special Access Programs In all fairness, with the intelligence field supposedly being one of the last bastions of “gentleman warfare,” it’s safe to assume America has its fair share of hush-hush programs geared at “borrowing” other nation’s research and development. In fact, known past and present Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) programs alone are shining examples of this. That aside, in the span of SAP controls, the Office for the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSDi) SAP Control Office fills the very vital role of monitoring and investigating counter-intelligence matters, security violations, or infractions within all DoD SAPS. Assisting OSDi’s Central SAP Office in this effort is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the powerful 17 individual agencies which make up the United States intelligence community. Bolstering this mighty SAP Central Office, the U.S. Defense Security Service (DSS) helps provide operational support and security oversight for all DoD SAPs. Of course, the first line of defense in protecting the integrity of SAP secrecy starts with who is granted access to a program.  Regardless, if a person is in the military, a federal-civilian employee, or a private contractor, several prerequisites must be met before one can work within a SAP. Working Inside A SAP The path to working in a SAP begins with a currently accessed person nominating a potential candidate to the “access approval authority,” or the central office that the SAP emerges out of. If a candidate does not presently possess an active secret or top secret clearance, the appropriate clearance must be obtained before one can be considered for involvement. Finally, all persons who will be involved in a SAP must agree to be subject to random “counter-intelligence scope” polygraph examinations and sign a DoD-approved SAP indoctrination and non-disclosure agreement. DoD Document Once inside a special access program, there are yet still several vital roles that help ensure the secure integrity of each individual program. Some of these are: The Government Program Manager (GPM), and their private industry equivalent, the Contractor Program Manager (CPM): The person who manages all overall aspects of a specific program. Program Security Officer: The person responsible for all aspects of security in the program. Every SAP has a PSO, however, large or complex SAPS can also have additional Government SAP security officers or contractor program security officers to assist the Program Security Officer. Further protecting who knows what, a SAP’s overarching scope and purpose can fall under one program “umbrella.” However, multiple compartments, which can further breakdown into separate sub-compartments, and finally, numerous projects, can all emerge out from under a single SAP umbrella. It’s entirely possible for a compartment, sub-compartment, or project not to have access, or even to be aware of the work that’s going on in other sections of the same SAP. When it comes to the extreme isolation of work, it’s not just about keeping information out of the hands of foreign adversaries. Sometimes components are cordoned off from each other because you may have two different contract partners from the same industry working on different aspects of a SAP.  In essence, caution must also be taken to ensure industrial partners don’t “borrow” each other’s trade secrets. DoD graphic Oversight Of Special Access Programs All Special Access Programs are subject to federal and defense acquisition regulations. As such, all SAPs can be audited and inspected by a host of oversight entities, including the Government Accountability Office or the DoD Inspector General. Equally, oversight of SAPs isn’t merely left to agency policies and directives. Instead, it’s a matter of federal law, as defined by Section 119, Title 10 United States Code. By federal statute, all active acknowledged, and non-waived unacknowledged Special Access Programs must submit reports to the House and Senate Authorization, Appropriations, and Intelligence Committees annually. These yearly reports provide committee members with an estimated total budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, a brief description of the program, including the number of persons involved, the status of significant milestones or current issues, and the actual cost of the program for each previous fiscal year. Any member not assigned to one of the defense or intelligence committees may be granted access to non-waived SAPs, provided they receive permission by the ranking and minority member from each of the respective committees and with approval by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense. But What About Those Waived-Unacknowledged SAPs? As mentioned earlier, in rare instances, when a SAP’s purpose and scope are deemed so sensitive that standard reporting procedures could pose a risk to national security, the Secretary of Defense can authorize the darkest of “black programs,” the waived-unacknowledged special access program. According to the Center for Development of Security Excellence, “Waived SAPs have more restrictive reporting requirements and access controls.” Determining what precisely the CDSE means by this statement is a little tricky. In the book, Strategic Intelligence : Covert Action, Behind the Veils of Secret Foreign Policy , author Lock K. Johnson notes, “Waived SAPs are only orally briefed to the so-called Gang of Eight, this is, the chair and ranking (minority) members of both the Senate and House intelligence (or Armed Services) committees, and House and Senate Majority and Minority Leaders.” Sure to raise a few eyebrows, Johnson mentions that the National Security Agency’s controversial “warrantless surveillance” program, which ran from 2001-2007, was a waived SAP. According to the very limited information provided by the Department of Defense’s Directive 5205.07, the “Access Approval Authority” for waived SAPs is narrowed down to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Under Secretaries of Defense, or a component head with “cognizant authority.” Beyond this, even after combing through hundreds of pages of DoD directives, policies, and federal Title 10 and Title 50 laws, it’s hard to pin down exactly how waived-USAPs are governed. Indeed, since the self-indulgent days of Project Yellow Fruit, the DoD has piled a sizable number of regulations and policies governing the Special Access Program process. However, given the obscurity of even being able to determine how checks and balances are maintained with waived-USAPs, one cannot help considering risks may still lurk within the very murky waters of this bureaucratic swamp. As we twist further down the spiral of sanctioned secrecy, let’s take a look at some of the concerns with intensive secrecy that’s governed by a mere few individuals. The Dark Side Of An Already Dark World Taking a glance at the DoD’s mind-numbing number of rules, regulations, and directives pertaining to SAPs, it’s not hard to see why the CDSE can make the claim that modern Special Access Programs have significantly more scrutiny and oversight than those of the past that may have been marked by somewhat laissez faire attitudes. However, it would not be objectively fair to not point out, even since the mid-1990s, there have been examples of mismanagement or corruption involving SAPs. When it comes to the corruptibility of SAPs, leading the charge is the biblical “root of all evil,” and the cold hard fact that these programs of isolated secrecy can involve enormous amounts of money. Just how enormous? Well, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , the United States’ $81.1 billion dollar budget request for classified intelligence programs alone in 2019, is larger than nine of the next top-ten foreign nations total military expenditures . Only China, with an estimated total defense budget of $250 billion U.S. dollars, exceeds the budgetary sum of America’s intelligence community’s classified budget. This does not include the tens of billions of dollars spent on the Pentagon’s non-intelligence related classified programs every year. As staggering as having a classified budget that exceeds many countries entire GDP might be, it still doesn’t account for all the money being spent on secret programs. A 2016 Office of Inspector General (OIG) report indicated the DoD couldn’t account for $21 trillion dollars in transactions and adjustments from 1998 to 2015. It’s important to note that this movement of funds, an average of $1.2 trillion annually during this 17 year period, which was “unsupported” by accounting documentation, does not reflect any actual “missing” money that could have gotten funneled into “black programs” or SAPs. OIG also did not suggest that any of these funds had gotten categorically lost, stolen, or otherwise burned in ritual sacrifice. At the same time, the U.S. military’s apparent inability to properly record trillions of dollars worth of transactions calls into question how well it is monitoring even its most basic financial activities to prevent money from ending up diverted or simply misspent. Historically, black programs have exploited the nebulous nature of U.S. government budgets to fund their efforts through complex arrangements involving multiple agencies, making a full accounting, or even any accounting, of their costs difficult. So going back to that initial question, just how large is the sum of the money involved in these black programs? We really don’t know because it’s seemingly uncountable. But it’s safe to say that it is very large. Considering how much of public politics is dominated by relentless bickering over the allocation of government funds, the potential for classified programs to have uncountable, perhaps even undefined, streams of cash is almost incomprehensible. Corruption Breeds In Shadowy, Cash-Packed Environments Access to large sums of difficult-to-track cash can have the unfortunate, yet all too common side-effect of tempting seemingly moral persons to engage in very immoral acts. Such was the case with former CIA executive Kyle “Dusty” Foggo, who was indicted in 2007 by the Department of Justice for accepting bribes in return for steering millions of taxpayer dollars towards his friend’s private contract company, ADCS Inc. In the same case against Foggo, former California Congressman and Navy ace fighter pilot Randy “Duke” Cunningham was sentenced to 8 years in federal prison for his part in the procurement scam. Absent any malicious intent, there are still areas within the SAP process that provide a safe haven for poor decision making and insufficient oversight. Chiefly, when it comes America’s elected leaders who are tasked with approving or disapproving clandestine programs. How many of them actually possess the technical prowess to adequately assess a program’s feasibility or need? Out of the members of the “The Gang of Eight”—the only eight members of Congress who are authorized to have knowledge of Waived-Unacknowledged SAPs—presently, none have any background in the military or technological and scientific research sectors. This reality is somewhat remarkable, considering one must possess the technical requisites necessary to work within a SAP, however, a significant number of the precious few who ultimately pull the strings of this hidden world outside of the Pentagon and the industrial complex that support it, need only to be popular among their constituencies. There are other potentially adverse aspects of secrecy that get very little attention. For instance, it costs exponentially more money to run a classified program than one that is unclassified. The deeper you get into the shadows, the more expensive that secrecy costs and declassifying something can be extremely expensive, problematic, and time-consuming. This has likely resulted in throngs of programs that pose little to no risk when it comes to disclosure, but will never see the light of day regardless. In addition, there have been accusations that some programs get classified at least in part so as not to compete with existing and in some cases inferior high-profile capabilities or operations that are already in production or underway. It’s possible that this could be to hide the program from those who would otherwise work to destroy it—especially the pork rollers on Capitol Hill and the highly territorial services that occupy the Pentagon. On the other hand, even a service itself could fear that its own clandestine emerging capability could threaten an existing one that it has already bet heavily on. Bad Ideas, Big Classified Budgets An argument can certainly be made that putting reclusive, highly complex, and expensive defense programs in the hands of elected leaders who lack any subject matter expertise makes for ideal conditions that result in costly and entirely avoidable failures. One example is the proposed nuclear-powered rocket system “Project Timber Wind.” Once considered a key component of President Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative—better known as “Star Wars”—Timber Wind also offers a peek at how deep secrecy can lend a hand to quietly crossing the line of what the public is likely willing to find acceptable in the name of national security. The aim of the once Unacknowledged SAP, Timber Wind, was to develop nuclear thermal rockets capable of reaching space to support ballistic missile defense. Outwardly unreasonable as it sounds, with America no longer facing the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, in 1992 when details about the program were declassified, many in the scientific community were stunned to discover the grand plan behind Timber Wind involved a two-stage rocket process whereby, immense tanks of liquid hydrogen attached to a nuclear reactor would be fired off into the atmosphere. Serving as the inspiration behind the founding of the Federation for American Scientists’ (FAS) “Project on Government Secrecy,” current FAS director Steven Aftergood would describe Timber Wind as “Just about as dangerous a machine as any I can imagine,” adding the SAP was “Sheer scientific adventurism.” When all was said and done, the government shelled out $139 million dollars before finally canceling Project Timber Wind. Though the loss of money may be significant, the potential costs for “pumping liquid hydrogen across a “bed” of uranium at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit” a mere stone’s throw from an unwitting Nevada or Utah populous, could have resulted in far more catastrophic public health and ecological consequences. Intriguingly, (in a macabre kind of way) a willingness to take extreme risk in order to maintain the vanguard defensive capabilities, isn’t merely an isolated event. Instead, as many former Area-51 employees have come to discover, secrecy with minimal oversight can have very personal and disturbing consequences. Area 51’s notorious perimeter. , X51/Wikicommons Area 51: A Place That Is Literally Above The Law In the mid-1990s, several former employees of the Air Force’s infamous Area 51 flight test facility—the developmental home of so many SAPs and a place that is itself a massive SAP—sought the help of legal scholar and attorney Jonathan Turley. Riddled with various serious illnesses, the former Area 51 workers told Turley that officials had, for years, been burning classified equipment and materials in large trenches for disposal at the secret military facility located seventy-five miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada. The plumes of thick toxic smoke that would billow and linger across the installation would come to be known as “London fog,” by Area 51 employees, Turley later recounted . Armed with tales of ecological catastrophe and a zeal for justice, Jonathan Turley and the Area 51 veterans would launch an epic legal battle to define the line between national security and basic civil liberties. The chief aim of the Area 51 employees’ lawsuit was to discover what exactly they had been exposed to, in hopes it might help them receive medical care. As reasonable as this request might have been, sanctioned secrecy protecting Area 51, not only allowed for the government to refuse information that might save the workers lives, it also allowed for the government to repeatedly insist that no such place even existed. Only after Turley provided satellite pictures he purchased from Russia, did the government finally admit Area 51’s existence to the courts. As a result, U.S. District Judge Phillip Pro would reject the government’s claim of  “state secrets privilege” and declare the government was required to disclose what hazardous chemicals employees had been exposed to. In a tragic twist, in light of the federal court judge’s ruling, no one would get the opportunity to ever find out exactly what types of toxic substances had been allowed to permeate the secret facility. Instead, in an 11th-hour intervention, President Bill Clinton issued a Presidential Determination that exempted installation from environmental disclosure laws. US Government Document Ultimately, by a stroke of the pen, secrecy overrode the federal law, defeated basic civil liberties, and largely sealed the fates of those impacted by the open-air burnings at the base. Also, President Clinton put a definitive stop to any appeals for government accountability at the reclusive military test site. Sadly, former Area 51 employees Wally Kasza and Bob Frost would lose their own personal battles with debilitating skin and respiratory illnesses. Analysis of tissue samples from the autopsy of Bob Frost showed , “unidentifiable and exotic substances that one of the nation’s premier scientists could not recognize,” Jonathan Turley later told the L.A. Times . Described by Turley as “deeply patriotic guys,” both men are assumed causalities of the government’s war to maintain secrecy at Area 51. Since the legal battles of the 1990s, more employees have continued to come forward complaining of serious and life-threatening ailments as a result of working at Area 51. Instead of making amends for the wanton risk placed on the very people who helped usher in some most remarkable advances in military technology the world’s ever known, every U.S. president has annually reissued President Clinton’s initial 1995 executive order declaring Area 51 to above environmental laws. While the potential for Special Access Programs to serve as hidden conduits for costly government waste can and should spark formal debate and even dinner table discussions, for the families of Wally Kasza, Bob Frost, and others who’ve found themselves dealing with the effects of extreme government secrecy, the price for that secrecy can come with significant and dramatically personal costs. Dark Nights Can Equal Bright Stars Now, as ominous as they may feel at the moment, Special Access Programs are far from being all doom and gloom. Conversely, as bestselling author Richard Paul Evans puts it, “It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars.” When it comes to bright stars set against a dark sky of secrecy, one must consider, arguably the forefather example of the modern SAP— Lockheed’s U-2 Dragon Lady high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. The minimal interference of working in the shadows allowed Kelly Johnson and his team of just 28 Lockheed special projects engineers to design, build, and fly a spy plane capable of flying at 70,000 feet in only 8 months. Ironically, the U-2 program also gave birth to Area 51 . U-2 testing at Groom Lake (what would become known as Area 51). , CIA Employing many of the same techniques used by SAPs today, the extreme secrecy reduced external meddling from the powers that be in and around Washington D.C., the potential of competing interests from the military services, from the very entity the program is being executed for, and from multiple outside contractors. The latter of which allowed 87% of the U-2’s development to be performed in a single building in Burbank, California, then the Skunk Works’ headquarters. Ultimately, deep secrecy can allow for wasteful “scientific adventurism,” the bottom-line truth is that this same risky inspiration can equally allow for incredible technological breakthroughs. In fact, without the breathing room of secrecy and minimal external interference, some remarkable and game-changing technologies may never have come to fruition. For instance, the F-117 Nighthawk and even the framework for the modern internet emerged from the dark shadows of Special Access Programs. Whereas disclosed defense programs that fail after a bunch of money was spent can have major repercussions, even though some would say not major enough, secrecy allows for risks to be taken without the fear of becoming a headline news story. Yes, this is a major concern for potential abuse and waste, but at the same time it has become somewhat essential to making huge qualitative leaps in defense-related technologies. Lockheed’s Skunk Works largely defined this reality and has built a hugely successful operational model around it that has been knocked off by many contractors and businesses entities. To put it another way, making it ok to fail by classifying a program can be an incredibly powerful tool for promoting major innovation. With all this in mind, it is simply impossible to ever say that that innovation shrouded by secrecy is inherently a bad thing. Tim McMillan Final Thoughts on Special Access Programs It’s important to note, we’ve almost entirely focused on the Department of Defense’s secrecy ecosystem and the Special Access Programs and “clandestine” operations that spring forth from it. Though briefly mentioned early on, when it comes to secrets stemming from the intelligence community and “covert” activities, that’s a whole other sprawling government maze, complete with entirely different regulations, policies, and federal laws. We’ll likely don our secret decoder ring and try to untangle that surreptitious web in the future. But for now… When it comes to Special Access Programs, like virtually all government operations, they are mostly cumbersome bureaucratic affairs. Though visions of a powerful shadow government of sorts may tantalize our imaginations, within the dense procedural jungle of SAPs, these programs are not inherently good or bad. Instead, SAPs are merely institutions made up of people, and like any group people, the inner sanctums of SAPs can be comprised of good and bad individuals and good and bad ideas. Few would competently argue against the fact that some defense programs and operations need to be tightly classified. That’s not to say there aren’t real concerns associated with deep black programs very few people even know exist. Notably, the designed exclusivity and compartmentalization of SAPs doesn’t just help protect national secrets, it allows for considerably impactful information to be secured to a minute number of defense officials, legislators, and industry insiders. With such a substantial vacuum of power and influence, self-interest can easily become national interest, and suddenly SAPs can become safe houses for careless, wasteful, or even illegal activities. Confidentiality may indeed be an unavoidable byproduct of ensuring national defense and we cannot reasonably expect to be able to eradicate the secrecy Special Access Programs protect. However, we can, and should, be willing to know how the underlying secrecy processes work. If for no other reason than to ensure secrecy is always maintained with a laser focus on the greater good for us all and a reasonable balance is being maintained between the need for secrecy and the public’s right to know.

"Chris ""Ox"" Harmer","Updated on Dec 10, 2020","An Army Marches On Its Stomach And A Fleet Deploys On Maintenance, Especially Its Carriers","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “An army marches on its stomach.” This truism of military mobility from the pre-industrial era has been attributed to both Napoleon Buonaparte and Frederick the Great. Nobody is sure if either actually said it, but both certainly experienced the reality of the maxim. In their time, not only did the vast armies of the era move by foot on the battlefield, they moved by foot to the battlefield. It was not uncommon for infantrymen to march hundreds of miles between major battles, and all that marching meant the soldiers had to be adequately fed. If they weren’t, they died of starvation, sickness, or were too weak to fight effectively and were slaughtered en masse, which is exactly what happened to Napoleon’s Grande Armée as a result of his poorly resourced invasion of Russia. I was reminded of this pithy saying recently when I read that the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) would be leaving on its third deployment in just four years. While Navy officials insist the deployment was planned in advance, the fact that it was announced shortly after the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) finished up an 18 month-long maintenance period that was originally scheduled for six months sparked speculation that the Navy was deploying the Truman to cover for the fact that Eisenhower simply wasn’t able to deploy. In the same way that pre-industrial armies marched on their bellies, modern navies deploy on their shipyard maintenance cycles. Modern warships require a lot of maintenance, both for the physical and mechanical components of the ship, as well as for the advanced electronic combat systems. Scheduled maintenance cycles can be delayed, deferred, or shortened, but that inevitably results in more expensive maintenance down the line, and a decrease in net operational availability for the ship overall. This is a reality the U.S. Navy is encountering with increasing frequency, as a result of just under two decades of high operational tempo deployments following the attacks on 9/11. While the Navy has not necessarily skipped maintenance across the fleet, the high operational tempo has generated a massive maintenance backlog. Whether the maintenance backlog is a result of inadequate programmed maintenance or excessive operational wear and tear, the net result is the same. The Navy has a massive pile of deferred maintenance that will take years to work off. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that it has less “surge capacity” now than at any time since the end of the Cold War. USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75)., USN Was The Truman Really Scheduled For Three Deployments In Four Years? For obvious security reasons , the Navy does not publish ship deployment schedules. In this age of instantaneous communication, an aircraft carrier deployment can’t possibly be hidden. Once it deploys, it is common knowledge, but there is no need to give potential adversaries a long-lead heads up on which ships are deploying when. For equally obvious operational reasons, sometimes those ship deployment schedules are adjusted. For example, shortly after the attacks of 9/11, the Navy surged a total of six Carrier Strike Groups to participate in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). So, ship deployment schedules are set in advance by Navy leadership, not shared publicly, and are adjusted to meet operational requirements. With that said, there is no reason to doubt the Navy officials who say that Truman was always scheduled for this third deployment in four years, following missions to the Middle East in 2015 and 2018. But whether or not Truman was actually scheduled for this most recently announced deployment, or was surged to cover for the non-availability of Eisenhower , is a distinction without a difference. The fact remains, Eisenhower is not available for deployment because a planned six month maintenance period turned into an 18 month maintenance period. While the ship itself is now out of drydock and physically capable of operating at sea, it is not remotely ready to deploy. The Eisenhower can float, but floating and fighting are two different things. It takes a lot of time and practice to get the ship’s equipment calibrated, the ship’s crew retrained, the air wing integrated, etc. Throw in combined training for the support vessels and the command staff, and the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group is at least six months from being deployable, probably closer to a year. USS Dwight D. Esenhower in drydock., USN Eisenhower’s Refueling and Complex Overhaul The longest and most complicated maintenance period in a carrier’s lifespan occurs about halfway through its expected 50-year service life when the Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) maintenance takes place. Readers may recall that Navy leadership recently threatened to cancel Truman’s RCOH. It’s a complex issue, but in reality, the Navy never had any intention of retiring Truman early. It was simply a budget maneuver to try to force Congress to fully fund both the carrier procurement program as well as the carrier maintenance program. The White House quickly put its foot down on its own Pentagon’s budget request to sideline the carrier. The RCOH centers around refueling the twin nuclear reactors that power the carrier plus inspecting, repairing, replacing, or rebuilding virtually every major component on the ship. It is an extremely complicated and expensive evolution and takes about four years to accomplish. Eisenhower started its RCOH in early 2001 and came out of the yards in 2005. At that point, in terms of materiel condition, it was the most capable carrier in the Navy, and it was returned to the fleet just in time to get tasked with multiple back to back-to-back deployments to the Middle East. Eisenhower conducts hard turns during a shakedown period after being returned to service following a maintenance period in 2011.  , USN Groundhog Decade And The Never-Ending Deployment: 2005 To 2017 Eisenhower exited RCOH just as several other carriers were reaching the limits of their mechanical endurance. Keep in mind, while the Navy advertises a “surge capacity” for aircraft carriers, and executed that surge capacity in 2001-2002 for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and again in 2003-2004 for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), that surge capacity comes with a big maintenance bill. Every time a carrier surges on an unplanned deployment, it inevitably racks up maintenance gripes that have to be worked off back in the shipyard. For Eisenhower , it became the backfill carrier that got tagged to cover the dip in carrier availability following the unscheduled surges from 2001-2004. As a result, Eisenhower deployed in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2016. Most people reading this article will understand that those deployments were packed with combat sorties over Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya. Keeping a high operational tempo going—like six wartime deployments in ten years—takes its toll on even the most robust equipment. Such was the case with Eisenhower . Eisenhower started that never-ending deployment cycle fresh off the RCOH, with brand new or reworked equipment. 12 years later, it was in dire need of major maintenance. Hornets launch from the Ike during a 2009 deployment to the CENTCOM area of operations. , USN How A Six Month Shipyard Maintenance Period Turned Into 18 Months Any modern warship is a complicated piece of machinery. A nuclear aircraft carrier is the most expensive and complicated piece of machinery on earth. There is a certain amount of service life in it, and the more you use it, the harder you work it, the sooner that service life is depleted. If you drive it to the breaking point, it will take time and effort to rebuild it. So, between the fact that the Eisenhower is at year 42 of its programmed 50-year service life, and the decade-long world tour it just completed, by the time it went into the shipyard for its planned six month maintenance period, a lot of other problems were just waiting to be discovered. And discovered they were. Eisenhower entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in August of 2017 and did not return to seagoing status until March of 2019. Ships go into the shipyard with a list of known problems and planned maintenance. If everything goes right, the planned maintenance fixes the known problem and that’s that. For Eisenhower , on the tail end of over a decade of high operational tempo and in the twilight of her career, it was assumed that some unexpected problems would crop up once the ship was in drydock. But nobody thought the maintenance issues would be as extensive as they were. As soon as Eisenhower was in the shipyard, and opened up for repairs, a host of other, unforeseen problems came into view. At that point, the only responsible option was to fix all the problems that were uncovered, which in this case extended the maintenance period from six months to 18 months. The stern, rudder, and screws of Eisenhower seen while in drydock., USN Inadequate Maintenance Facilities Are Also To Blame There is no mystery here. What happened to Eisenhower was completely predictable and the same or similar problems are presenting across the fleet on other platforms. While the obvious cause of the problem is excessive deployments, inadequate maintenance facilities are also to blame. The Navy force structure is currently about 280 commissioned warships, with an extremely ambitious plan of growing the fleet to 355 commissioned warships in just 15 years. But as this article shows, that goal of a 355 ship Navy seems wildly unrealistic, given the current woeful state of Navy support infrastructure, specifically shipyards capable of executing heavy, in-depth maintenance and repairs. Considering that the Navy’s current maintenance infrastructure is inadequate to execute a maintenance plan for 280 ships, absent a truly sustained investment in building shipyard and maintenance capacity, the Navy won’t be able to sustain a fleet of 355 ships, even if it gets them built, which seems unlikely at this point. The problem of inadequate maintenance facilities is most apparent with the attack submarine force. According to the General Accounting Office, inadequate capacity at Navy shipyards certified to work on nuclear attack submarines has resulted in a significant maintenance backlog for those platforms. As a result, USS Boise (SSN-764), has not been certified to dive, let alone deploy, for two years while awaiting maintenance. In total, Navy attack submarines have lost over two decades of operational availability while waiting pier-side for maintenance. Those submarines that are not in a deployable status while waiting for repairs are carried on the books as commissioned warships of the U.S. Navy, but are not capable of deployed operations. The Navy pays the financial cost of keeping the ships in commission, but gets no operational utility out of them because they are not deployable. As Napoleon said, an army marches on its belly. Likewise, a fleet deploys, or in this case, does not deploy, on the basis of its shipyard maintenance program. USS Boise photographed during better days while deployed in 2014. , USN Why Is Unscheduled Carrier Maintenance A Problem? Henry Kissinger famously said that the first question during any crisis was “Where are the carriers?” To paraphrase another one of his sayings, “An aircraft carrier is 100,000 tons of diplomacy.” Point being, aircraft carriers are unique in the U.S. force structure in terms of executing both “tip of the spear” force projection as well as less kinetic, but still important “presence” missions. Exercises with allied navies and port calls to “show the flag” remind potential foes, with the exception of Russia and China, that if a Navy aircraft carrier deploys to any given region in the world, on arrival it is the most capable air force in that area. Aircraft carriers are not important to U.S. strategy—they are indispensable and irreplaceable. Nothing else can do what they do. Due to a whole lot of deferred maintenance, the Navy has fewer deployable aircraft carriers right now than at any time since the end of the Cold War. At a glance, Eisenhower is not deployable as previously discussed. USS Nimitz (CVN-68) just got out of the shipyards in Washington State, and like Eisenhower , is at least six months from deployability, and probably closer to a year. USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) just entered the shipyards in Washington for a planned maintenance period. USS George Washington (CVN-73) just entered drydock in Norfolk and is out of service for at least four years for RCOH. USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) is in the shipyards in Norfolk for maintenance. Finally, the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) was commissioned in 2017, but is nowhere near ready for deployment. Ford recently experienced some serious emergent problems with its propulsion plant , as well as the ongoing chronic problems with its completely redesigned and technologically advanced aircraft launch and recovery systems, and a litany of other issues. That leaves a maximum of five carriers available for deployed operations. To be clear, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for all five to deploy at once. Point being, with six of 11 carriers either in maintenance, or doing post maintenance workups, it is possible that the remaining five deployable carriers will experience an extremely high operational tempo which may, in turn, lead to deferred maintenance accumulating as was the case with Eisenhower . While this worst-case scenario is not inevitable, it is certainly plausible, and if it takes place, it will result in a death spiral of decreased availability and readiness that will be very difficult to recover from. To be clear, the current situation is not permanent and hopefully will prove to be the exception, rather than the rule. Navy leadership has clearly committed to working off the deferred maintenance issues and is working hard to protect the carriers from being tasked with anything other than regularly scheduled deployments, in order to restore a surge capacity. With that said, the increasingly dire situation paired with the dream of reaching a 355 ship fleet in the coming decades, resulted in the Navy recently looking into the possibility of bringing the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) back in to service, 58 years after it was commissioned, and nearly a decade after it was decommissioned. While bringing a 58-year old decommissioned aircraft carrier back to life was deemed unrealistic in the end, keeping the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) in commission past its expected 50-year life span is not. Nimitz is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2023, and as this article observes, the Navy is taking a serious, in-depth look at what it would take in terms of maintenance support to extend the operational service life of Nimitz beyond that. Extending the service life of a class of ships beyond its planned duration is not limited to carriers. The Navy is also looking at extending the service life of surface combatants , as well. USS West Virginia (SSBN-736) departs Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. The Navy is finally trying to improve the crumbling infrastructure that is tasked with keeping its fleet alive. , USN A Constant Tension Between Presence, Combat Operations, Surge Capacity, and Sustainability The fundamental issue that is playing out here is the constant tension between what Combatant Commands (COCOMs) want and what Navy leadership wants. In a time of war, COCOMs are responsible for fighting the conflicts our country is engaged in. During peacetime, COCOMs are responsible for maintaining our alliances and deterring our enemies. In contrast, Navy leadership is tasked with “manning, training, and equipping” the fleet. In other words, the Navy prepares the fleet for deployment, then once those ships actually deploy, it turns them over to the COCOMs for employment, whether that is peacetime presence, alliance building, exercises, or wartime combat operations. Inevitably, COCOMs always want as much carrier presence in their Area of Responsibility (AOR) as possible. In peacetime, there is an almost limitless demand signal by our allies to have engagement with Navy aircraft carriers. For example, both South Korea and Japan are acquiring F-35s. Japan is also modifying its helicopter carriers to support F-35 operations. As Japan and South Korea develop their abilities to operate F-35s, they will want to exercise, demonstrate, and validate that skill set by operating at sea with Navy carriers and/or amphibious assault ships operating Marine Corps F-35Bs. There are a dozen other peacetime scenarios involving carriers from high-profile exercises, such as the biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC) with its always entertaining live-fire Sinking Exercises (SINKEX) , to more mundane peacetime operations like port calls in Singapore, a country that is also acquiring F-35s and will undoubtedly want more exercises with the US Navy as a result. At the same time, our allies are asking for US Navy carrier presence in order to exercise their ability to operate with us and to validate their status as allies. U.S. forces are also engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The current pace of operations is low enough that the Air Force can handle manned strike operations in Syria without any help from the Navy, but this is the exception, rather than the rule. Be that as it may, this relative lull in combat operations is almost certainly temporary. In addition to peacetime presence operations and wartime combat operations, there is the issue of Iran. The U.S. is not at war with Iran, but the ongoing tension between the two countries results in a constant demand signal for aircraft carriers to be physically present in the Persian Gulf to serve as a deterrent to further aggression. While the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) was always scheduled to spend at least part of this year deployed in the Persian Gulf, its deployment to the region was accelerated in May to respond to an updated threat assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). Lincoln has been in the US Central Command (CENTCOM) AOR since then and will be for some time to come. What the COCOMs want is maximum carrier availability in their AOR. What Navy leadership wants is to meet their legal mandate to maintain, train, and equip the Navy, and preserve the long-term materiel viability and surge capacity of the fleet. The more the COCOMs use the carrier fleet, the less “surge capacity” there is. These demand signals are in constant tension. USS Ronald Reagan alongside Japan’s ‘helicopter carrying destroyer’ Izumo . The ship is going to be refitted to accommodate F-35Bs. The Reagan will eventually receive F-35Cs, as well. , USN Rotational Deployments, Fleet Response Plan, And Optimized Fleet Response Plan From the end of the Cold War until the attacks of 9/11, the Navy balanced the competing priorities of COCOMs and the requirement to maintain, train, and equip the fleet for future availability by using a rotational deployment policy. Essentially, the Navy set maintenance, training, and deployment schedules for carrier strike groups far in advance. For the most part, the Navy and the COCOMs adhered to the schedule. Each COCOM was guaranteed a certain amount of carrier presence, with the caveat that the real world no-fly-zone operations and any associated combat operations would take priority. For the most part, Operation Provide Comfort I and II, Operation Northern Watch , Operation Southern Watch , Operation Deny Flight , Operation Deliberate Force , and Operation Desert Fox took place using regularly scheduled assets. Rotational deployment cycles were great for ensuring maintenance and training requirements were met, but the only real flexibility on the deployment side of the equation was extending carrier strike deployment beyond the planned six months. In short, rotational deployments were a supply-side construct, ensuring a steady, but a relatively inflexible supply of carrier strike groups would deploy to COCOM AORs. Following the attacks of 9/11, it was clear that rotational deployments would no longer be adequate. The demand signal generated was so large and enduring, it seemed obvious that short term surge requirements would be on the table for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Navy instituted the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) in 2003. The FRP had the same basic elements as rotational deployments. A given carrier strike group would go through maintenance, training and deployment phases, with an added emphasis on the sustainment phase following deployment. In other words, carrier strike groups returning from deployment would not immediately stand down into a maintenance phase, but would remain in a sustainment phase, capable of responding to a surge requirement. In 2014 the FRP was updated into the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP). OFRP was a nominal 36-month cycle, with 16 months for maintenance and training, followed by a seven-month deployment, then 13 months of sustainment training, with the carrier ready to execute a surge deployment if required. Nimitz, the Navy’s oldest operational carrier, seen during a recent drydock period. , USN Mattis And Dynamic Force Employment Even though the FRP and OFRP were less predictable than the rotational deployment model, they were still fundamentally predictable. As part of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, the term Dynamic Force Employment was used to describe a new approach to deployments, intended to produce certainty for the maintenance facilities and ships crews with respect to maintenance and training periods, but uncertainty in the minds of adversaries regarding the timing and duration of deployments. Both Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford championed the use of Dynamic Force Employment as a necessary construct in order to deal with the return to great power competition. At the beginning of this article, we talked about Truman getting hit with back to back deployments. In actuality, that was the first iteration of the unpredictable carrier deployment pattern that is the heart of the maritime component of Dynamic Force Employment. In the case of Truman, it went on deployment in April of 2018 to the Mediterranean, returned to homeport Norfolk, Virginia, in July of 2018, left on deployment again in August of 2018, returned to Norfolk in December of 2018, and is now preparing to deploy again later this summer or early fall of 2019. Having three carriers train together in the West Pacific, as had occurred in 2017 , sends a strong deterrent message and makes for some great pictures, but it also adds to the strain on the Navy’s carrier fleet that will have to be made up for down the line., USN So What’s The Answer? We’ve looked at a lot of symptoms that are reflective of some obvious causal factors. The Navy is too small for what it is being tasked to do, and has inadequate maintenance resources in terms of time allocated to maintenance, as well as shipyard capacity to perform that maintenance. Fortunately, we’ve caught a bit of a break. While the four front war in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya is not remotely close to being over, for the moment, at least, it is not generating an excessive demand signal for Close Air Support (CAS) or Time Sensitive Targeting (TST) on call, which is what the carriers spend a lot of time doing when deployed. So, if luck holds and there is no additional excess requirement for carriers to surge, and if the maintenance budget is fully funded for the foreseeable future, and the Navy is able to recapitalize and modernize its maintenance infrastructure, then the it might be able to work off some of the massive backlog of deferred maintenance and restore a little additional surge capacity back into the fleet. Aside from the temporary (trust me, it’s always temporary) lull in demand signal for excess carrier deployments, Big Navy itself has finally generated a comprehensive plan to address the “supply-side” of the problem, namely, taking on inadequate capacity at Navy shipyards, issues with the maintenance supply chain, and fixing the ship maintenance industrial base at large. The “Long Range Plan For Maintenance And Modernization Of Naval Vessels” can be found here . Bottom line, if Congress continues to fully fund the maintenance plan, if external circumstances allow us to avoid significant unplanned surge deployments, if the Navy’s industrial base maintenance plan is implemented, the Navy should be able to restore some surge capacity in the not so distant future. As the saying goes, the enemy always gets a vote, but in terms of the things we can control, we are—just barely, and for the time being—getting back on the right track.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Happy birthday America! As we all celebrate July 4th in various ways today, it’s important to remember that our nation’s independence came at a high human cost on all sides. We wouldn’t be celebrating Independence Day without the sacrifices of colonists, tens of thousands of whom gave their lives in securing America’s independence from the British. Like any major conflict, the Revolutionary War was a testing ground for all manner of new weaponry and techniques designed to inflict heavy losses on enemy forces. Recent advances in gunpowder meant that militia members and soldiers alike encountered massive new weapons in the field that would have seemed like dark magic to Colonial soldiers or militiamen who were serving in the armed forces for the first time and had not yet witnessed modern warfare firsthand. Crude forms of artillery had been used in Asia and Europe for a few hundred years, but the types of Napoleonic artillery unleashed during the Revolutionary War were capable of new feats of accuracy and lethality that previous designs couldn’t match. These truly revolutionary artillery weapons fell under three main categories: cannon, mortars, and howitzers. Artillery reenactment at Yorktown Battlefield with cannon, foreground, and howitzers, background., Wikimedia Commons Cannon Some archaeological evidence suggests that cannon were used as early as the 12th century by the Song Dynasty in China and parts of the Islamic World , although these early examples were crude, handheld devices which more resembled vases than the long-barreled cannon we think of today. Both handheld and mounted cannon designs continued to refine and develop around the world throughout the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, leading to the smoothbore, muzzle-loading cannon which saw use on both sides of the Revolutionary War battlefield. These cannon were typically made of cast iron or occasionally bronze, and were loaded with a pre-made paper or cloth cartridge filled with gunpowder. Cannon were typically carried between battlefields by horse-drawn carriages and were mounted on a single two-wheeled axle or sometimes a four-wheeled cart which allowed them to be moved short distances and positioned by small crews. Effective range varied wildly among different Revolutionary War cannon, but typically maxed out around 1,000 yards. The semi-mythical Molly Pitcher reloading a cannon after her husband was injured., Wikimedia Commons Cannon are typically rated by the weight of their projectiles. The most commonly used cannon during the Revolutionary War were 3-pound “galloper” and the steadier 6-pound guns, although larger cannon up to 18 pounds saw use in some conflicts. The recoil from these guns would propel the cannon backward, further increasing the time it would take to reload and reset each gun. Typical artillery pieces with a crew of around ten men could fire cannon at an average of four times per minute . They fired a variety of projectiles including solid shot, explosive-filled cannon balls, large diameter grapeshot, smaller diameter cannister shot, various shrapnel shells, and chain shot. A bag of grape shot would be separated in the barrel from its explosive charge by a metal disc the same diameter as the barrel’s bore., Wikimedia Commons Chain shot and its more rigid variation, bar shot, consisted of two halves of a split cannon ball joined by either a chain or a solid metal bar. When fired, the two halves would spread open in flight and tumble or spin end-over-end, leaving a devastating path of destruction in its wildly inaccurate wake. A typical 18th century chain shot, Wikimedia Commons These kinetic projectiles were sometimes used as anti-personnel weapons of the most brutal kind, but were most often fired during naval warfare to snap the masts or sever the rigging of ships when fired by smaller Naval cannon variants like the carronade or the swivel gun . Mortars After cannon, mortars were the next most commonly used artillery during the Revolutionary War. The principle behind both weapons is the same, but mortars feature a much shorter barrel and a higher angle of fire. Like the mortar weapons of today, these were mounted on a flatbed or frame and were fired at steep angles in order to fly easily over earthworks or other fortifications and rain down shrapnel on enemies. The maximum range for these mortars was somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,400 yards, although their effectiveness dropped sharply at around 700 yards. A period howitzer on display at Yorktown Battlefield, Wikimedia Commons Typical Revolutionary War mortars featured explosive shells ranging from four to 13 inches in diameter which were loaded directly into the barrel. Unlike cannon, however, these mortars were chambered, meaning the explosive charge was loaded into a separate chamber rather than in the muzzle along with the shell. Howitzers Another Revolutionary War variant of the cannon was the howitzer, whose barrels were much shorter in length but much larger in diameter than the cannon. In some ways, the Revolutionary War howitzer was a hybrid between the mortar and the cannon in terms of barrel size and length. Howitzers averaged around eight and 13 inches in diameter and around three feet in length. The typical effective range of these weapons was around 750 yards. A Revolutionary War howitzer on display at Yorktown Battlefield, Wikimedia Commons These chambered guns also fired explosive powder-filled shells with a timed fuse that was lit by the firing charge, and were much more maneuverable during battle thanks to their shorter barrel length. Revolutionary War Artillery Tactics These artillery weapons played a key role in the battlefield tactics of the Revolutionary War, but their effectiveness was limited by the time it took to load and fire them and their low-level of mobility. Because these weapons were so cumbersome, officers on both sides of the conflict would have to carefully place their artillery like chess pieces before a battle in an attempt to maximize their effectiveness. Errors in planning could, therefore, render these weapons useless during a battle. Battlefield commanders had to make careful considerations about how to use their precious artillery. Enemy infantry could be targeted in order to inflict heavy losses, or enemy artillery could be targeted in order to protect one’s own infantry. Because these weapons were so hard to move, artillery would often change hands throughout a battle as infantry advanced and took ground. Enemy artillery was seen as something of a spoil of war and both sides routinely lost and gained artillery pieces throughout the conflict. A reenactment of an artillery unit firing a cannon, NPS.gov Artillery was most commonly placed in a single group called a grand battery in the center of an infantry line, but sometimes lined flanks or were spread at intervals among infantry lines. This artillery would lay down covering or destructive fire as enemy infantry advanced, altering their type of munition depending on battlefield conditions and tactics being employed. When enemy soldiers were densely packed, solid shot was most often fired, aimed low in order to roll or skip across the ground and mow down entire columns of troops. One anecdote claims that 42 men were cut down by a single ball during a battle and there are dozens of accounts of cannonballs ripping limbs right off of infantrymen . Explosive shells or various types of small-diameter shot were more commonly used against stationary or fortified targets such as during the Siege of Yorktown or Battle of Trenton —some of the most pivotal victories for the Continental Army. In terms of naval artillery tactics, the Siege of Yorktown was in many ways made possible due to the fact that French naval forces possessed heavier cannon which allowed them to fire heavier projectiles at the British. Both the British and the French fleets suffered heavy losses at the Battle of the Chesapeake, forcing the British Navy to retreat back to New York without reinforcing and resupplying their forces at Yorktown with fresh artillery. The Battle of Trenton by Charles McBarron, 1775, Public domain In 1776, John Adams famously wrote a letter to his wife Abigail remaking that America’s Independence Day “ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with shews, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one End of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more.” When you’re safely and responsibly celebrating with your own mortars and explosives this 4th of July, remember the sacrifices of the brave men and women who marched into battle against the British facing the devastating artillery of the era and the many generations of servicemembers who have done so against ever-more more powerful artillery in the centuries since.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 15, 2019",Veteran U.S. Navy Submariners Explain Why Fire Is So Deadly Aboard A Submarine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The harrowing fire aboard the Russian nuclear-powered mini-submarine Losharik that claimed the lives of 14 of Russia’s most experienced submariners and shocked the world community this week is a reminder of just how threatening fire is to submarines and the brave people who operate them. Any fire aboard any vessel can be perilous, but flames, and the noxious smoke and gasses they produce, unleashed within tight confines and self-contained atmosphere of a submarine present a whole other level of danger for ship and crew. But don’t take it from this landlubber. Instead, veteran U.S. Navy submariners Aaron ‘Jive Turkey’ Amick and Eric Moreno offer candid and detailed explanations of the threat of fire on submariners in the wake of the Losharik incident. In one of his outstanding ‘whiteboard’ explainers , Amick goes into the nuts and bolts of the threat of submarine fires and how they are dealt with. As you can see, there is much more to it than what immediately meets the eye, from how submarine floors ‘float’ on ledges against the hull, to the different classes of fire, including those that can start by countermeasures that are actually activated by seawater and burn incredibly hot in a sustained manner, to how little time there actually is to diagnose and address a fire before it becomes catastrophic. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-WDB1KZ00 Veteran U.S. Navy submariner Eric Moreno, who runs the popular Reddit page R/Submarines and the Tac Ops podcast , also shared his insights with The War Zone regarding the menacing nature of fire on submarines. Every submarine has a different way to deal with casualties. This is based on how different they are designed due to mission requirements. The Ocean Gate research submarine Titan deals with casualties completely different than a military research submarine like Losharik . This is due to submarine design, personnel, technology available, and training. One thing that is similar among every submarine, and ship for that matter, is the procedures utilized to deal with each casualty. Here is a picture of the PIP—Procedure In Place—on the USS Cavalla (SS-244). This is a metal book that holds the procedures for every casualty. PIP aboard USS Cavalla. , Courtesy of Eric Moreno Grabbing a rocket booster and running out of the torpedo room to throw it topside is just one of the many crazy things we are accustomed to. Submariners run drills multiple times a day almost every day to ensure they are ready for any emergency. The three most common casualty drills ran on any nuclear submarine are fire, flooding, and random reactor drills. All three are treated specially by the US Navy. Even when a US submarine is in port, the submariners drill for fire and flooding casualties. The U.S. Navy’s submarine force trains all their submariners in the “Fire Fighting Trainer” and the “Wet Trainer”. This gives the submariners the most accurate and controlled environment to simulate what can’t be simulated underway. Fires onboard submarines, historically, have been the most common casualty. That is why it is the top priority—train against the biggest threats. USN So what causes fires? Cigarettes burning in butt cans/ashtrays can be the most common reason fires are called away. A full butt can will make a nice size fire. Cigarettes are the only open flame allowed on most submarines. The U.S. Navy prohibited the use of cigarettes on submarines on Jan 1st, 2011. Electrical fires are the second most common submarine fire. They can be relentless and require special knowledge to secure power or else they will continuously reignite. Fires on submarines are special. You cannot treat them like a normal house fire. During a house fire, the heat and smoke have a way to escape. It is dissipated into the atmosphere. There is no means of escape on a submarine, not just for the people but also for heat and smoke. The heat and smoke immediately rise and collect in the highest space. Military submarines like nuclear fast attack submarines (SSNs), nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), and even some diesel-electric submarines (SSK) have multiple levels. This allows heat and smoke to dissipate. The larger a space is the more atmosphere there is to ‘absorb’ a fire. This gives the crew more time to properly react. That “PIP” shown above takes time to pull out, read, and execute. The smaller your submarine is the smaller the atmosphere is. The smaller the atmosphere is the less time you have to react. Single level submarines like the Losharik force the heat and smoke sideways, directly toward the entire crew. Smoke inhalation is more common on single level submarines due to the minimal time the crew has to don emergency breathing masks. Emergency breathing masks are easily accessible but still take time to put on with a proper seal. The fact that her crew put out this fire, surfaced the boat [or mated with her mothership] and got towed back to Severomorsk without further incident is a true testament to the ones that survived. Losharik is a very unique, deep-diving, special missions submarine. Its name is a reference to its exotic internal design that is anything but apparent when viewing her externally. Moreno states: Losharik was named after a Russian stop motion circus animal magically made of balls by a circus performer…. Seriously.  This is in reference to her internal hull structure being made of spheres instead of the standard cylinder setup. This gives Losharik the ability to dive down to very extreme depths. Russia says that the fire occurred in Losharik’s battery compartment. One can only imagine how its unique ‘spherical pressure vessels strung together’ design would have impacted the fire and how it was able to be effectively fought. But regardless of the design, it’s ironic and chilling to think that the biggest threat to any submarine, a vessel that operates below hundreds or even thousands of feet of water, is fire.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In 2001, I was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 14 (CVW-14), at Naval Air Station (NAS) Lemoore, California. I wore two “hats” for CVW-14. First, I was the Force Protection (FP) and Anti Terrorism (AT) Officer. The seven squadrons of CVW-14 were geographically dispersed at Naval Air Stations Lemoore, Point Mugu, and North Island, all in California, at Whidbey Island in Washington, and Norfolk in Virginia. I was responsible for FP/AT for all of them. Second, I was the Seahawk Weapons and Tactics Instructor (SWTI) on staff, so I trained the helicopter squadron assigned to CVW-14, the Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Four (HS-4) Black Knights, at NAS North Island in Coronado, California. On the morning of September 11, 2001, I was in my apartment in San Diego, burning off some “use or lose” leave. My only problem for the week was deciding which beach to hit each day of my “staycation.” At 0700, I was awakened by a call from my “little boss,” the Operations Officer for CVW-14 who simply said “Wake up. The big boss wants a call at 0800 with a status update.” Click. My “big boss,” the Commander, CVW-14, wanted a phone call from me at 0800 with a status update… On what? I was used to being interrupted on leave. It happens, But why? I called back to Lemoore—no answer. I called the helicopter squadron at North Island—no answer. I turned on the TV, saw the news, and thought—well, that’s what he wants. I eventually got through to all seven squadrons in the air wing, confirmed they were set at Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Alpha (as if they needed me to tell them that) and called back to Lemoore at 0800. I told the big boss that his air wing was at FPCON Alpha and he asked if I had any other inputs. I replied, “Sir, it could have been a lot worse. So far, there’s no indication they used Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).” To be clear, the attacks of 9/11 were horrific. Equally clear—they could have been far worse. Shortly after 9/11, Bush administration officials began sensitizing the American public to the reality that having endured the conventional attacks of 9/11, America needed to prepare for and prevent what the enemy was clearly trying to do next, obtain WMD to conduct a bigger, deadlier attack, either in the U.S. or overseas. Almost exactly a year later, on Sunday, September 8, 2002, then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, while making the case for the U.S. to invade Iraq and end Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, one way or another, said “we don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.” By that point, I was no longer in San Diego. I was in Japan, getting ready to prevent that mushroom cloud from happening, by taking down a ship that was (or so we thought) transporting WMD. Forward Deployed Naval Forces Are Always Ready In June of 2002, I reported to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 14 (HS-14), the Chargers, part of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5), stationed at Naval Air Facility (NAF) Atsugi, Japan. Together, HS-14 and CVW-5 were assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) stationed just down the road in Yokosuka. At that time, CVW-5 was comprised of three squadrons of F/A-18 Hornets and one squadron each of F-14 Tomcats, S-3 Vikings, E-2 Hawkeyes, EA-6B Prowlers, and SH-60 Seahawks. In other words, we were the only helicopter squadron in the air wing, which meant at times we wound up getting pulled in many different directions. It’s better to have too much to do than not enough, but as the only helicopter squadron, we were never plagued with inadequate tasking. We always had more customers and tasking than operational bandwidth. USN For most of its history, the Navy’s carrier fleet has followed a cycle of deployment, followed by a post-deployment stand down and maintenance period, followed by a training and exercise cycle in preparation for deployment, followed by another deployment. During the post-deployment and stand down maintenance period, the carrier and carrier air wing are in a greatly reduced readiness status. The carrier and its aircraft are in heavy maintenance, personnel are in classroom training, and a relatively limited amount of training flights are being executed. For a carrier/air wing team in this status, it would take at least 45 days to prepare to deploy—put aircraft back together, finish or cancel ground training, get all the pilots requalified on carrier landings, and so on. In contrast, Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF) are manned, trained, and equipped to be always ready for deployment. Our tether was measured in hours, not days. At any given time the ship and air wing had to have a certain percentage of personnel on station, ready to deploy, as well as a certain number of aircraft in a Full Mission Capable (FMC) status. Using the nomenclature of the time, we were constantly at T-1 levels of training and readiness, at M-1 levels of materiel support, and at C-1 levels of combat capability overall. To be clear, the FDNF carrier and air wing stationed in Japan do execute deployments, they are just of shorter duration and greater frequency than the standard six- to eight-month deployments of the rest of the carrier fleet, which is stationed in the Continental United States. Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 14’s Structure And Mission In 2002, HS-14 was equipped with five SH-60F and three HH-60H Seahawk helicopters. Like all carrier-based HS squadrons at the time, we had a very challenging and diverse set of missions. As the name indicates, the primary mission of the squadron was Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). With a powerful and accurate dipping sonar, the SH-60F Seahawk airframes were optimized for ASW in the aircraft carrier inner defense zone. From a hover, the sonar could be lowered on a cable into the water, then start actively pinging. If a submarine was within detection range, the sonar waves would bounce off the hull and be picked up and displayed by our onboard processor. In contrast, the HH-60H was optimized for Naval Special Warfare (NSW) support. It had a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) turret on the nose, a standard suite of Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) such as Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), Infra-Red Guided Missile Counter Measure (IRCM) devices, chaff and flare dispensers, and a wire strike protection system. HH-60H dropping off some SEALs via fast-rope during a boarding exercise. , USN Additionally, the HH-60H could carry a rail on the port side of the aircraft holding up to four AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, as well as crew-served machine guns. With all the seats stripped out in the back, it had just enough room to carry up to ten or eleven total personnel, between aircrew and SEALS. For an optimal/fully supported NSW mission, we would have two of the HH-60Hs equipped with M-60/M-240 7.62 mm machine guns, one out the port window, and one on the starboard side in the cabin door, with two to three aircrewmen and eight SEALS onboard. The third HH-60H would serve in a command role and as a weapons truck, loaded with Hellfire missiles, a .50 cal machine gun in the cabin door on the starboard side, a SEAL sniper or two, and the senior ranking officer for the SEAL detachment to provide command and control. Depending on the size/threat/nature of the NSW mission, we could roll in some support from the SH-60B Seahawks flown by Helicopter Antisubmarine Light Fifty One (HSL-51), the Warlords, also stationed at NAF Atsugi. Like the HH-60H, the SH-60B had a FLIR and Hellfire capability; it also had a surface search radar and robust data link. Both these capabilities were very useful in the maritime NSW environment, especially in the extremely congested waters of the Pacific Rim. HS-14 helos over a SSGN., NUSN At the time, HS squadrons flew SH-60F/HH-60H Seahawks primarily off of the aircraft carriers, and HSL squadrons flew SH-60B Seahawks primarily off of surface combatants, such as frigates, destroyers, and cruisers. Although, depending on the mission, we would “cross deck” to each other’s ships as required. In any case, for a maritime NSW mission, depending on what the target and operation looked like, we would have a mix of HH-60Hs and tricked-out SH-60Fs carrying SEALS, an HH-60H serving as a fire support and/or command platform, and an SH-60B providing situational awareness and comms via radar and data link. Who Wants Some Scud Missiles? Many veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq refer to these conflicts as “never-ending wars,” and with good reason. But long before the U.S. ever contemplated getting involved in armed conflict in either of those countries, we entered into a different land war on the other side of Asia, on the Korean peninsula. While the Korean Armistice Agreement of 1953 put a stop to active combat as part of the Korean War, it did not formally end the war. As a result, U.S. forces on the Korean peninsula constantly train to various “renewal of hostilities” scenarios. The FDNF carrier/air wing team, although stationed in Japan, are integral to these contingency plans. Needless to say, a lot of our attention was focused on the Korean peninsula, and whatever shenanigans the North Koreans were up to. Since 1953, North Korea has engaged in plenty of malfeasance on or near the Korean peninsula, including initiating multiple armed skirmishes on the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), infiltrating North Korean soldiers wearing South Korean military uniforms into South Korea, printing extremely accurate counterfeit U.S. currency and distributing it in South Korea, kidnapping Japanese citizens, and the list goes on. Beyond their destabilizing activity on the Korean peninsula itself, North Korea has been a designated state sponsor of terror for over two decades. One of the reasons it has been listed as a state sponsor of terror is that it provides support to other designated state sponsors of terror, including Iran and Syria. Scud SRBM being raised for launch on its TEL., USN North Korea is the primary technical enabler of the Iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. We knew all this at the time, of course. There has never been any doubt as to the nature of the North Korean regime. What changed after 9/11 was that North Korea had been identified by President Bush as part of the “axis of evil” along with Iran and Iraq. We knew that the North Koreans had been exporting ballistic missiles to the Middle East and we were about to experience what the U.S. and its allies were prepared to do to stop it first hand. Short Notice Maritime Interdiction Operation Even though it was 17 years ago, out of an abundance of caution, I am going to leave out some of the details of the mission. Suffice to say in the fall of 2002, we received message traffic that Commander, Seventh Fleet (C7F) was putting together a task force and we were to supply three helicopters and adequate pilots, aircrew, and maintainers to that task force to conduct a Maritime Interdiction Operation (MIO) that would last at least 30 days. C7F is the numbered Navy fleet that exercises command and control over all Navy assets in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. C7F has a massive footprint—think of it as operating from just west of Hawaii all the way through the Western Pacific, and across the Indian Ocean to the Pakistani coastline, where Commander, Fifth Fleet (C5F) takes over. We were ordered to report to Okinawa. Readers will be familiar with many of the larger U.S. military installations on Okinawa, including Kadena Air Base and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. Less well known is the U.S. Navy facility at White Beach. It is little more than a massive pier extending 2,500 feet out into Nakagusuku Bay and some shore support facilities, but that is all we needed to rally up. Three surface ships, embarking a total of five helicopters, three HH-60Hs and two SH-60Bs, and a platoon of SEALS (approximately 16 personnel), as well as a couple of EOD techs gathered at the pier. We were under strict orders not to discuss the mission and were told we would not get any further intelligence on it until we got underway. The cockpit of an HH-60H., USN We had never worked with this particular SEAL platoon before, so we took the opportunity to talk things over with them, go over the aircraft, walk through our Helicopter Visit Board Search and Seizure (HVBSS) and fast-rope terminology. We weren’t talking about our particular mission per se—none of us knew for sure what it was—but we thought it would be a good idea to make sure we were all on the same page generally before we got underway. We were feet dry in Okinawa for no more than 48 hours. This was just enough time to gather everyone together, get supplies loaded, figure out how we were going to split the helicopters, pilots, aircrew, and SEALs among the three surface ships, and get a superficial inbrief with the task force commander. This consisted primarily of a “who’s who in the zoo” data dump on what ships, aircraft, and personnel were in the task force. Why We Got The Mission Instead of 160th SOAR In a previous article, I discussed why Navy SEALs fly most of their “feet dry” missions on Army and Air Force helicopters, but this operation is a great example of the opposite situation. As we were loading up in Okinawa, we heard rumors that the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) detachment in South Korea was making a bid to take the lead for flight support. While the 160th does great work, we never thought we would lose this mission to them. This was a purely maritime NSW mission and there are too many things that land-based helicopters just can’t do well on ships. Army helicopters have operated successfully from big deck Navy ships like aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, and supply ships, but operating from small-deck surface combatants is another issue entirely. The first video below shows the entire concept of the Recovery Assist Secure Traverse (RAST) process that helicopters use on small surface combatant and the second video shows an SH-60B using the system: In order to conduct RAST landings, helicopters have to have all of the associated equipment built into the airframe—it’s not something you can add on in a few hours or days before the mission. The reality is that small ships pitch, roll, and yaw much more than the big ships the 160th SOAR was used to operating off of . As such, there was no possibility that they were going to be able to take this mission. Sure enough, within 36 hours of getting the initial prepare to deploy order, we also received confirmation that this would be an all-Navy mission. Navy ships, Navy SEALS, Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and Navy helicopters. Sometimes it seems our modern approach to warfighting takes the joint approach too far and it felt good to have an all Navy mission. Underway And Mission Brief An hour or two after we got underway, the pilots, aircrew, SEALS, and EOD techs got the full inbrief on the mission. Sure enough, as suspected, it was a North Korean ship we would be going after, the So San . At the inbriefing, we received some of the intel that identified the So San in port in North Korea being loaded with Scud missiles. While there was no definitive evidence of WMD being loaded, the potential was obviously there. WMD are a lot smaller than Scud missiles. We knew the Scud missiles were there, we had to assume that WMD might also be present, too. The mission was clear—we were going to conduct a multi-helicopter assault against the So San , preferably at night, with four helicopters—two HH-60Hs loaded with eight SEALS and EOD techs each, another HH-60H functioning as a weapons truck with missiles, machine guns, and SEAL snipers, and an SH-60B for comms relay and radar cueing. This was a mission we had practiced endlessly and we had executed a number of unopposed actual HVBSS operations in the past. Here is a good video of a practice HVBSS conducted out of an MH-60S, which is very similar to an HH-60H. An unopposed HVBSS in permissive conditions would look very similar to this: We were excited to know the target, get the mission, and start preparing. But as we looked a little closer at the photos we had of the So San , it quickly became apparent this would be a very difficult ship to take down via HVBSS, due to the number of cables and wires strung around the ship. In order to execute the HVBSS, a helicopter has to hover over a clear space on the deck of the ship, a fast-rope has to be tossed out of the helicopter to the deck, then the SEALS and EOD personnel have to rapidly descend the rope. The So San had very little clear deck space. It’s cargo loading cranes and stanchions were all stayed with multiple cables and wires. That would make the insertion via fast-rope extremely difficult, and slow. USN We discussed shooting out the wires with the Navy SEAL snipers and the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the platoon. Ultimately, we decided the advantage gained by shooting out the wires was less than the risk incurred by firing the first shot. If this was going to devolve from a surprise HVBSS in the middle of the night into a firefight, we wanted the North Korean sailors to take the first shot. Remember, we had three HH-60H helicopters, two of which had two M-60/M-240 machine guns, one of which had a .50 cal machine gun and four Hellfires, plus a SEAL sniper at our disposal. If it went hot, we were confident we had enough firepower to quickly suppress any resistance. The best outcome here was to take down the ship without any shots fired and without any of the North Korean sailors getting killed. Depending on what the cargo turned out to be, their value as intelligence assets might be significant, and of course, if we killed them on the way in, they couldn’t tell us anything. An HH-60H door gunner., USN It’s Just Scud Missiles, Who Cares? The military efficacy of the Scud missile is relatively limited. It is a short-range ballistic missile with extremely poor accuracy. As a first strike or counter strike weapon aimed at military targets, it is of virtually no value. With that said, it is a very effective weapon for use in terror attacks against civilian populations. During the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein’s forces launched approximately 42 Scud missiles at Israel. This action, more than anything else, threatened to shatter the fragile U.S.-led coalition. In any case, the U.S. was very interested in this shipment of Scud missiles—where was it going? Who was the intended recipient? What was their purpose in acquiring the missiles? As an added complicating factor, at the time North Korea was reportedly expanding its WMD program. It was possible that along with the Scud missiles, North Korea was proliferating Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical (NBC) weapons, their components, or their associated technologies. While we were not at war with North Korea, we certainly were at a state of heightened tension and any hint of WMD ratcheted up the intensity even more. Training, Tracking, And Training Some More It was just under 1,000 nautical miles from Okinawa to the port where the So San was located. Again, out of an abundance of caution, I am not going to tell you which port the So San was getting underway from. Suffice to say North Korea has a number of ports on the east coast of the Korean peninsula, with direct access to the Sea of Japan, and on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, with direct access to the Yellow Sea. Both of these seas are extremely crowded with commercial shipping and fishing vessels. Our plan was to lay off the coast far enough that North Korean intelligence would not detect us, wait to get “cued” onto the So San , then follow it via primarily visual tracking, using the five helicopters in our task force plus other land and sea-based aircraft. USN Of course, all three ships and both SH-60B helicopters had powerful radars that could have tracked the So San fairly easily, but U.S. military radars have a very specific emissions signature. Had we used active radar to track the So San , it might have keyed them in as to our presence. Once we were on station off the Korean Peninsula, we began training for the mission. We had all done dozens of practice HVBSS operations and some of us had quite a few unopposed HVBSS missions under our belt, but this would be a pretty big operation—up to five helicopters airborne at once, with the potential that it could turn into a firefight at any time. Most Navy surface combatant vessels have a helicopter hangar with room for two birds, but only one can launch at a time. From the time one helicopter launches, it can take up to 30 minutes to get the second helicopter out of the hangar, unfold its rotor head, and get it spun up and launched. Launching five aircraft from three separate vessels was going to take some timing and coordination, so we began practicing the mission, day and night. It seemed like forever, but it was only a couple of days that we had to wait for the So San to get underway. Once it was, we began a game of cat and mouse. We had to stay close enough to the So San to keep visual contact via helicopters and FLIR, but not so close that it would see us. We had other national reconnaissance assets external to the task force to help cue us in, as well. USN Exactly how we tracked the So San beyond using our Mark 1 Mod 0 eyeballs, I will leave up to the reader’s imagination. Suffice to say, from shortly after it got underway until the So San was boarded, 6,500 miles away from North Korea, the U.S. Navy knew exactly where the ship was. Is Tonight The Night? We were told the execute order on this mission was going to be made at the national level, so our local commanders would not have any more of a heads-up then we would. We knew the execute order could come down at any minute, but we also knew that our window to execute the order was night time and most probably late at night or early in the morning. We quickly developed a rhythm. If we did not get the execute order by about 0500, we knew we were off for the next twelve hours and went to sleep. We’d get up around 1200, check the message traffic, see what was on the boards, and plan our training flight for the day/evening. We did the first two or three training flights during the day, to maximize safety and familiarity with each other. Once we had our battle rhythm down, we started doing most of our training flights at night. So, depending on sunset, we would generally plan a late afternoon/early evening launch, wait for total darkness, do a practice HVBSS, land, stow the aircraft, and wait in the wardroom on the ship, wondering if tonight was the night we would get the go order. USN We were generally done with our training flight by around 2130 and in the wardroom by 2200 each night. The wardroom is basically a small dining room for officers, which doubles as a planning space between meals. We sat around the table, drinking Diet Coke, waiting for the go order until 0500, then we’d hit the rack. The go order never came. What The Movies Leave Out: Nice Work, Now Go Home In the movies, there is always a mission, and always a go order. In real life, a whole heck of a lot of military operations consist of preparing to do something, then not doing it. That’s what happened in this case. It’s 6,500 miles from Korea to where the So San was eventually taken into custody. Our task force of three ships, five helicopters, about 20 pilots and aircrew, a SEAL platoon, and a few EOD techs tracked the So San for a lot of that distance, but not all of it. An HH-60H crewman waits in the dark., USN The further away we got from our home base of Japan without getting the go order, the more skeptical we would ever get it. The mission started to look a lot more like a babysitting operation than a takedown. We started to speculate that now that national reconnaissance assets were dialed in on the So San , the probability was we would be called off. The logic was clear—if the So San was headed to the Middle East, the smart play was to let it get as close to the intended destination as possible, gather intelligence, see what they were up to and where they were going, before taking the ship. Sure enough, after several weeks on mission, we got the call. We were canceled. The task force was heading back to Japan. Don’t Worry, This War Ain’t Ending Anytime Soon I remember the exact moment the mission was canceled. It was almost sunset and we had a no-fly day scheduled to allow the maintainers to catch up on working off gripes on the birds. I was standing on the fantail with a few of the other pilots when the ship slowed down, turned 180 degrees and picked up speed. We all knew even before reading the message traffic that our task force had been ordered back to Japan. Nobody had much to say, except one of my aircrewman, who looked at me and said “Don’t worry, sir. This war ain’t ending anytime soon.” I laughed and let the bitterness slip away. The mission wasn’t a failure—someone else would take down the So San . It just wouldn’t be us. USN Spanish Navy Gets The Prize On Monday, Dec. 9, 2002, the Spanish Navy frigate Navarra (F85), accompanied by its oiler and support vessel Patino , hailed the So San on bridge-to-bridge radio frequency. Navarra challenged it to stop and prepare to be boarded and inspected. At the time of the challenge, the So San was located several hundred miles southeast of Yemen, roughly where the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden meet. The So San ignored the verbal challenge and continued on its way. Accordingly, the Navarra fired warning shots across the bow of the So San , which caused it to stop and accept the boarding. The Navarra ., USN As the following picture shows, when the Spanish Navy finally did execute the HVBSS takedown of the So San , they did so during the day, after confirming with the captain of the So San that they would be coming aboard. But before they fast-roped in, Spanish snipers shot off some of the guide wires. As you can see, the forward cargo post has no aft tending guide wire stays. a Sea King helicopter from Navarra fast-roping a VBSS team aboard. , USN A detachment of Spanish Sailors and Marines boarded the vessel without incident and began the search. In the cargo hold, they discovered, as expected, a shipment of 15 Scud missiles, concealed under bags of cement. What was not immediately clear was the destination of the missiles. Despite rampant speculation that other more nefarious cargo might be onboard, repeated searches of the So San by a U.S. technical team revealed nothing of significance other than the Scud missiles. The cargo hold of So San had concrete packages covering containers loaded with Scud missile components. , USN USN USN USN USN Iran? Sudan? Iraq? Al Qaeda? No…Yemen At first, the captain of the So San would not reveal his intended destination. Speculation was rampant that the intended recipient of the Scuds was either a state sponsor of terror or a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). Eventually, the Yemeni government filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of State as the shipment of Scuds was in fact destined for Yemen, a country which at that time was ostensibly allied with the U.S. coalition in the ongoing anti-terrorism operations that were then known as the Global War on Terror (GWOT). So, after a lot of high visibility drama that made the front page of newspapers around the world, we let the So San go on its way to Yemen where it delivered its cargo of cement and Scuds. Was This A Spanish Navy or A U.S. Navy Mission? Yes. While the Spanish Navy ultimately executed the Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) of the So San , this was, from inception to completion, a U.S. Navy mission. At the point of seizure, U.S. leadership made a decision to let our Spanish ally take the lead. That was a frustrating decision for many of us in the Navy that had spent over a month tracking the So San , but it was also the right decision. Although Spain has a limited military capability, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, it agreed to work closely with the U.S. government on the GWOT. As best I can tell, the decision to allow the Spanish Navy the prize of actually taking down the So San was intended to thank them for the cooperation and to solidify their status as a close U.S. ally in the GWOT. It was also a chance for the Spanish Navy to show that it could conduct important, high visibility operations at a distance from Spain. Spanish commandos aboard So San. , Spanish Defense Ministry/Getty Images) From Major Win To Faux Pas? Initially, the capture of the So San and discovery of Scud missiles looked like a major win for the Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) component of the GWOT. The vast majority of the technology transfer between the ballistic missile and nuclear program of North Korea and Iran takes place on ships, as does the transfer of weapons from Iran to Sudan. Also, the majority of Iran’s transfer of rockets to Hezbollah and Hamas takes place by ships. If you want to stop the State Sponsors of Terror from helping each other and helping their allied or cooperative FTOs, you need to have an effective MIO program. The public doesn’t know much about the MIO program, but in the aftermath of 9/11, the Navy and its allies were conducting or preparing to conduct MIO in dozens of locations around the world. It’s the epitome of a low profile, high impact mission. So, successfully detecting, tracking, intercepting, and boarding the So San was a major, high visibility win for the Navy MIO program—right up until the point we figured out the Scuds belonged to an ostensible ally. Spanish Navy snipers provide cover aboard Narvarra during the boarding, search, and seizure operation., USN A Small Win Is Still A Win In retrospect, the mission was executed correctly. There was no way to know where the Scud missiles were going and boarding the So San was the only reasonable course of action to take. The fact that a U.S. ally was buying Scud missiles from North Korea was portrayed by the media as an embarrassment, but most of us involved in the mission didn’t see it that way. Everything about the So San mission was done correctly. The fact that Yemen was buying Scuds from North Korea painted the country in a far worse light than the U.S. decision to interdict the shipment and ascertain its destination. Bottom line, the Scuds weren’t destined for a state sponsor of Terror or FTO. Nevertheless, the U.S. Navy validated its capability to detect, track, and seize illicit cargo on the high seas. We sailed away disappointed that it wasn’t a bigger win, but a small win is still a win.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 25, 2019",Are Some Of The UFOs Navy Pilots Are Encountering Actually Airborne Radar Reflectors?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following the revelations that a series of bizarre encounters between Navy pilots and UFOs had occurred off the east coast of the United States from 2014 to early 2015 , The War Zone set out in search of any possible explanation for at least some of these incidents that don’t involve fantastic origins or extremely advanced technology. Over the last month, we have identified one possibility, in particular, that is worth mentioning. Instead of anti-gravitational propulsion or flying machines from space, this possibility—and that is all it is, a possibility—has to do with specially designed radar reflector balloons and submarines, as well as a historical precedent for an obscure operational electronic intelligence gathering concept that first came to be during one of the hottest moments of the Cold War. The description given of objects involved in numerous close UFO encounters with Navy pilots off America’s eastern seaboard during the 2014-2015 timeframe is akin to a ‘beachball’ or orb with a cube suspended inside of it with the cube’s corners touching or nearly touching its edges. This sounds amazingly bizarre and is more reminiscent of what we would expect from a sci-fi movie circa the 1980s than the classic flying saucer or even the large ‘Tic Tac’ that Navy pilots encountered back in 2004, but to me, it also sounded eerily familiar. When I thought of round orbs with cubes inside them, balloons and radar reflector devices came immediately to mind. I began hashing out this possibility with my colleague Joseph Trevithick shortly after the reports came to light. The reality is that traditional high-altitude balloons and radar reflectors already go hand-in-hand. Because a high-altitude balloon doesn’t have much, if any, of a radar cross-section, metallic radar reflectors, which come in a variety of geometric shapes, are strung below its gas envelope, thus providing a radar return so that it can be tracked. The combination can look pretty bizarre in and of itself and they are cumbersome and clumsy arrangements . But couldn’t this be simplified for more conducive deployment and better aerodynamics by just suspending the reflector inside the balloon itself? A similar arrangement is used for radar reflectors that float on the water or are strung up on ships, but what about one that has to travel through the atmosphere? Just as I thought, an answer to that question has already been proposed. After searching sporadically over a number of days for what I envisioned in my mind, I found just that in U.S. Patent #2,463,517 , titled “Airborne Corner Reflector.” Airborne Corner Reflector., USPTO The patent was filed way back in 1945 and was granted in 1949. It is alarmingly similar in appearance to what the pilots had reported seeing multiple times over the Atlantic Ocean. In fact, a near miss encounter with one of these objects as described by Navy Super Hornet pilot Ryan Graves states that the object was likely standing still, floating in the air, when the Super Hornet blasted by at a too close for comfort distance. In other words, it wasn’t making any extreme performance maneuvers while within visual range. Instead, it was acting like, well, a balloon. Hear Ryan Graves describe the encounter in a clip from History Channel’s To The Stars Academy -helmed show Unidentified : Other statements from Graves and a squadronmate have pointed to the fact that these objects can stay in the air for many hours at a time. This is a characteristic also possessed by a balloon of some sort. Even the perceived threat from a collision with one of the objects and the Navy’s lack of interest in dealing with it at the time wouldn’t be as surprising as it is now if they were indeed balloons. Weather balloons and other high-altitude balloons are launched into the skies daily and fly among airliners without the ability to track or avoid them. You can read more about this reality here . Getting back to the patent in question, it reads in part: “While the invention is of paramount importance in ascending balloon assemblies, it may be used in fixed installations such as can be used for navigation. In the former case, the weight of a rain-soaked or ladened reflector adds to the drag of separate units and in the latter case the protection to the reflector afforded by the balloon multiplies its life several times. Upper wind velocities, i. e., at elevations of from 30,000 to 40,000 yards, heretofore unobtainable, may be recorded by use of the present invention. With prior devices such readings could not be obtained because these heights were not attained by the balloon and unit or at least not while it remained in recording range. As will be understood, the balloon is made of electrically non-conducting material. The device being collapsible can be packed into small space. The elasticity of the supports and/or the reflector unit itself provides for the usual expansion of the ascending balloon. The unit does not cut off the balloon into isolated sections and accordingly it may be filled with gas through a single port. I prefer to seal the balloon after the reflector unit is secured in position. The seal may be a separate piece as illustrated, or may include the intake port. A typical balloon will be about six (6) feet in diameter, although a such [sic] smaller or larger one may be used. The points of the reflector surfaces are joined by rubber bands, as by spot vulcanization. The use of rubber bands or elastic reflector surfaces is to allow for the usual expansion of a rubber balloon as it attains great height with the resulting low atmospheric pressure…” What’s most interesting is how it describes the ability to be packed into a small space. Being able to launch something just like this in a pre-packaged, all-up canister from a submarine—especially a submerged one—would be highly beneficial. Today, submarines can release canisters to the surface that deploy small aerial drones and it is even possible that balloons could be released from very shallow depths without the use of a canister of any type. Regardless, there is actually a historic precedent for clandestine operations where submarines launched balloons carrying radar reflectors as part of intelligence gathering operations. Documents released by the Central Intelligence Agency describe submarine-launched balloon tests that were conducted by the CIA and the USAF as far back in 1955. By 1963, submarines were executing complex, high-stakes, and secretive operations to gauge the abilities of enemy air defense systems by launching radar reflector-toting balloons. In the awesome book Lockheed Blackbird: Beyond the Secret Missions , one of these missions is described in remarkable and highly relevant detail. A-12 Oxcart landing at Groom Lake. , Lockheed Martin The A-12 Oxcart —the CIA’s precursor to the USAF legendary SR-71 Blackbird—possessed extreme speed and the first stealthy features ever intentionally deployed on an operational combat aircraft. But low-observable (stealth) design was in its infancy and the Skunk Works and the CIA needed a way to really gauge just how survivable the A-12 would be against the latest and greatest Soviet radar systems. The rest is history: “During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US intelligence community had monitored the construction of no less than 19 SA-2 SAM sites on the island and these provided the CIA, together with Oxcart [the codename for the A-12 spy plane program] planners, an ideal opportunity to determine the sensitivity of its associated radar receiver. One night, a US Navy destroyer equipped with a Palladium transmitter positioned itself beyond the detection range of a Soviet “Tall King” A-band early warning radar situated near Havana. With its antenna protruding just above the horizon the destroyer produced a signal that appeared to be emanating from a US fighter out of Key West, making a high-speed dash towards the capital, Havana. At a predetermined time, a US Navy submarine surfaced near Havana Bay, just long enough to time-releases a series of balloons carrying radar reflectors of varying sizes. The idea was that having detected the ‘aircraft’, the Soviets would switch on SA-2 target tracking radars in preparation for engaging the target. Release of the balloons ahead of the ‘target’ would produce a number of returns, of which the smallest reported would present the highest level of radar sensitivity. The operation worked like clockwork. Cuban interceptors were also scrambled to hunt down the ‘intruder’, and when one of their pilots told his ground controlled intercept (GCI) controller that he had acquired the ‘target’ on his radar, the technician on the destroyer flicked a switch and the ‘US fighter’ disappeared. After analyzing the intelligence data collected from this operation and by other means, the CIA’s concluded that Soviet radar capability would indeed be able to track and ‘lock on’ to an Oxcart, despite the aircraft’s radar attenuating design features. Despite these discouraging findings, flight test continued.” ​ ​​​ It is unclear if the successful espionage tactics used in this operation became more commonplace later on as enemy air defense systems grew more complex and capable. It would be strange to imagine that it wouldn’t have, but the world of submarine warfare is a dark and murky domain that is shrouded in extreme secrecy. Fast forward to today and modern submarines have highly advanced electronic intelligence gathering capabilities —it’s a primary mission set that is often overlooked or misunderstood by the public. At the same time, they don’t really have a way to stimulate enemy air defenses organically in order to record these emissions and even communications that go along with them without surfacing, and even that is speculative and based on what we know about the 1963 operation. Being able to deploy balloons with various sized radar reflectors while submerged could be a relatively low tech, but highly effective way of doing this. By sneaking in or near enemy territory, releasing these devices under the right weather conditions, and raising their low-observable electronic intelligence gathering masts, they could theoretically improve the quality of the intelligence gathered remarkably. In addition, submarines could deploy these air defenses-stimulating balloons within enemy territory during operations that are executed in cooperation with other assets. These could include strategic surveillance aircraft operating at standoff ranges, or stealthy reconnaissance aircraft operating at closer ranges, either of which could better soak-up radar emissions and communications from an enemy’s air defense network over a broad area. Leveraging space-based capabilities is also another possibility. The submarine’s ability to do so is more localized as it is limited by the distance to the horizon in relation to its electronic intelligence gathering mast’s height, at least when it comes to detecting land and surface-based air defense-related emissions. Under this concept, the submarine would just be a delivery system for the airborne reflectors and could maintain maximum stealth at all times. USS Hawaii transits Tokyo Bay. Virginia class submarines are just as much underwater spies as nothing else. , USN Regardless, it is possible that the mission that occurred in 1963 in support of the CIA’s A-12 program was a progenitor of more mature capabilities that are in existence today, or maybe the tactic has been recently borrowed out of the intel community’s historic playbook. Testing how sensitive an enemy’s air defense capabilities actually are, let alone what the exact ‘electronic fingerprints’ are of its individual components and cataloging their geolocations, is far more important now than it was in 1963. Such intelligence would be extremely valuable, especially in an age of stealth technology where knowing exactly what your foe’s electronic order of battle is and what their integrated air defense system’s strengths and weaknesses are at any given time is absolutely key for the complex mission planning that allows assets to successfully penetrate enemy airspace and survive to do it again the next day. Paired with modern materials science, one can imagine just how easily deployable and effective these balloons could be today. Radar reflector equipped balloons that are capable of being clandestinely launched from below the waves could also work in tandem with other similar balloons that carry small expendable electronic warfare payloads aloft instead of radar reflectors. These would confuse stimulated enemy radars even more and could potentially produce multiple ghost radar returns that exhibit extreme performance on a radar operator’s scopes. In other words, the large formations as described by radar operators in some of these encounters could be a mix of electronic warfare and radar reflector payload-carrying balloons. Such a capability could be used during a time of way to distract the enemy as well as for intelligence gathering. In fact, during the Nimitz incident in 2004 , a bunch of targets appeared on radar over the Channel Islands and progressed south towards the carrier group at the speed of a Cessna, but at high altitudes, with some of those targets quickly dropping to sea level in an instant before shooting back up. Recently, I looked into a chaff cloud that originated from this exact locale and progressed to the same exact area where the Nimitz was operating at a speed of around 100-110 knots. The discovered the high velocity was due to the jetstream that was positioned directly overhead and pulling the mysterious cloud along at an impressive clip. The same could have been the case for a group of balloons launched during the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group’s training back in 2004. In addition, the targets that appeared during the Nimitz encounters actively jammed the radars of fighter aircraft. Once again, this may have been an electronic countermeasures payload on some of these devices. With this in mind, is it possible that what Nimitz Carrier Strike Group radar operators saw was a bunch of radar reflector and/or electronic warfare payload-carrying balloons? It seems at least worth considering, especially considering the alternative explanations. USN Obviously, this doesn’t explain the Tic Tac encounter with Super Hornet pilots in any way, but they could be mutually exclusive events or were part of a coordinated event of some type to test multiple clandestine technologies against the very best air defense capabilities on the planet at the time. Regardless of the Nimitz event, a hypothetical picture is emerging of what could be an extremely useful classified ecosystem of capabilities and tactics that could be employed to actively mine critical info on air defense systems located in an enemy’s own backyard or even distract the same enemy’s air defenses during a time of war. And here’s the catch—such a capability may not belong to the U.S. alone, or even at all, at least in current times. It could belong to an adversary who needs a way to collect critical intelligence on American radar systems in areas that their most capable systems frequent for training. This is particularly relevant when it comes to observing a carrier strike group during spin-up operations before deployment and especially those that are packing new advanced air defense hardware, which was both the case during the Tic Tac incident in 2004 and some of the encounters in 2014-2015. You can read more about this peculiar similarity in this past exclusive of ours . Diving deeper into our patent search, we discovered another balloon concept that was far more advanced—one that could be able to be actively controlled and make abrupt maneuvers. U.S. Patent #7341224B1, which was filed in 2004 and awarded in 2008, describes a Miniature Robot Surveillance Balloon that has thrusters to control its flightpath and can carry an electrical-powered payload aloft. Miniature Robot Surveillance Balloon, USPTO The patent reads in part: A miniature surveillance balloon system is described that can be used in military and public safety situations for real-time observations. They are low-cost and expendable, and typically are deployed in clusters. Balloons may act individually or alternately clusters may act robotically (in unison) without command input at times. Balloon systems may be deployed by dropping from aircraft or by some form of artillery or rocket launch mechanism. In some optional embodiments, balloons may have thruster mechanisms to facilitate lateral movement. Balloons may also be used individually or in clusters as a weapons system. … In general, the balloon system may be encouraged to travel in the vertical direction by releasing gas from the bag to descend and by either injecting gas from the compressed gas cylinder and/or jettisoning weight to ascend. The balloon system may optionally include some form of directional thrusters to allow it to travel in a specific horizontal direction and/or travel in a vertical direction at a rate faster than the effects of lift and weight would allow. Thrusters may be provided by solid rocket propellant, or alternately by miniature engines that burn hydrogen gas from the bag or from the gas cylinder. The patent for the swarming balloons goes on to describe its fuel cell, data-link, and other components that are quite interesting. We have no idea if something like this was ever actually developed, but it is another good reminder that somewhat exotic applications for older technological concepts could result in capabilities that seem alien at first glance. And really, that is the beauty of these balloon concepts, they have a cover story built-in—they would appear somewhat out of this world to even a trained observer. Throw in an LED light and you are talking about something that can look extremely strange, especially to a fighter pilot moving past it at high speed. Its small size would also make it hard to spot in the first place and depending on its radar reflector configuration, it could exhibit a highly variable radar cross-section. If anything else, a submarine-launched balloon system designed to catalyze clandestine electronic intelligence gathering is a remarkably creative, but obscure concept that existed nearly 60 years ago. Does it explain every aspect of every detail of every incident Navy personnel have described over the last 15 years? No. But nothing else does without jumping to some extremely reality-warping conclusions. At the same time, as I have stressed repeatedly, it is entirely possible, if not probable, that there isn’t a monolithic answer to the UFO question and that multiple truths exist regarding the topic as a whole and even regarding the individual cases that are making headlines today. F/A-18F Super Hornet. , USN In the end, we have to look at every single possibility and evaluate each one of them with an open mind. I promised my readers that I would dig as deep as possible to find any potential existing technological answers that could address even parts of what highly-trained and credible witnesses are seeing, regardless of what or whose narrative it may fit. At this time, without going into the well-established and frankly, at this point, still relevant theories that include government cover-ups of world-changing technologies or even craft visiting the Earth from other worlds, this is the closest I have come to a valid answer. And yes, I do realize that even implying that what people describe as unexplained objects could be ‘balloons’ is highly inconvenient considering the stigma surrounding that explanation. But in this case, that doesn’t make it any less worthy of examination considering we aren’t talking about some garden variety weather balloons here and there would be a real reason for any military power to keep such a capability secret. The fact that there is an actual precedent for employing a similar concept secretly during the Cold War also adds significant weight to the possibility. In the end, that’s all this is, a possibility. One of a number to mull over as we all continue on what has become an increasingly historic and bizarre quest for the truth. What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than six decades after Bell introduced the world to the very first version of its famous UH-1 Huey helicopter, variants and derivatives of this iconic design continue to serve governments and fly commercially around the world. But not all of these subsequent helicopters have been as successful or become as well-known as their progenitor. Case in point, the Bell 214ST, with its stretched, bulged fuselage, which makes it look something like the offspring of a Huey and Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk . Bell developed specifically for the Iranian military, but which never entered service in that country and has since become popular with contractors that often work for the U.S. military. The Bell 214ST first flew on July 21, 1979, at the company’ s Dallas-Fort Worth facility. Two years earlier, the company had flown an experimental helicopter derived from the earlier Bell 214, which showed much more of its Huey lineage. As time went on, the design not only increased in length by 30 inches compared to the previous model, but saw significant changes to the central fuselage and nose. It also gained an entirely recontoured upper exhaust and tail. Two General Electric CT7-2 turboshafts, each one generating 1,625 shaft horsepower, powered the 214ST. The CT7 series, also known as the T700 series, is still extremely popular today and variants are found on a wide array of commercial and military helicopters, including Bell’s own UH-1Y Venom and AH-1Z Viper , as well as the UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache gunship. The engines made the 214ST significantly more powerful than the existing twin-engine UH-1N Twin Huey variant, and its commercial cousin the Bell 212, which used the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6T Twin-Pac , a turboshaft that consists of two PT6s linked together to generate a combined 1,250 shaft horsepower. The 214ST also had multiple then-state-of-the-art automated flight systems to improve handling. A Bell 214ST helicopter belonging to Bristow Helicopters., Gary Watt via Wikimedia “Basically, the 214ST is the 214 heavy lifter with a stretched cabin, two GE CT7-2 engines replacing the single Lycoming LC4B, a strengthened transmission passing rather more horsepower, new plastic [fiberglass] rotor blades and Noda-Matic suspension,” Mark Lambert wrote in an article in Flight International magazine in June 1979, ahead of the first flight. “The result is a new twin with exceptional hot-and-high capability and good single-engined performance.” More than 3,000 pounds heavier than the UH-1N, the 214ST had a maximum takeoff weight nearly 5,000 pounds greater than its smaller twin-engine cousin and a faster cruising speed of 140 knots. The stretched cabin could accommodate 20 individuals in greater comfort than the maximum of 15 people who could ride in the rear of a Twin Huey. The new helicopter was powerful enough to hover with a total weight of 12,400 pounds at sea level while running on just one engine. It also had a one-hour run dry transmission and elastomeric rotorhead bearings for improved reliability and safety. As Lambert noted in his Flight International piece, the origin of the 214ST is inseparable from that of the Bell 214 , which first flew in 1970. Originally marketed as the Huey Plus, the 214 was itself a variant of the earlier Bell 205, also known to the U.S. military and others as the UH-1H. While both the 205 and 214 are single-engine helicopters, the latter is instantly identifiable due to its much larger engine housing and exhaust. The Huey Plus replaced the older Huey’s Lycoming T53-L-13 engine with a much more powerful Lycoming T55-L-7 , the same engine found on early models of the CH-47 Chinook . The 214 also had wider chord rotor blades than the 205 and the Noda-Matic suspension and improved rotorhead found on the later 214ST. The latter features help dampen vibrations, which in turn would make for a smoother flight and reduce wear and tear on the airframe. All of this, combined with the larger engine, gave the helicopter much better hot-and-high performance than its predecessor. A commercial Bell 214-series helicopter., Meggar via Wikimedia With its significantly improved performance and capabilities well suited to deserts and mountainous terrain, the 214 had grabbed the eye of the Shah of Iran. He subsequently signed an order for nearly 300 214A models for the Imperial Iranian Army, with production starting in 1972. The Imperial Iranian Air Force received a smaller number of 214Cs, which featured a rescue hoist and other features for use in the search and rescue mission. A small number of 214s served in the militaries of Ecuador, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well. Between 1974 and 1975, Bell then began development of the 214ST specifically to meet Iranian requirements for an even larger, more capable military transport helicopter. Iran had picked Bell’s offer over France’s Aérospatiale Puma and the British Westland Wessex , the latter being a license-produced turbine-powered derivative of the Sikorsky S-58 . The Shah and Bell had also agreed to eventually establish domestic Iranian production of the Bell 214A and C in the city of Isfahan. This agreement later expanded to include plans to build the 214ST in Iran, as well. A Bell 214A still in service in Iran., Shahram Sharifi via Wikimedia But while Iran did receive hundreds of 214A/Cs, it never got a single 214ST and the Iranian factory never came to be. Protests beginning in 1978 eventually evolved into an open revolt in 1979, with the Shah’s government collapsing entirely in February of that year. The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a prominent Shia Islamic cleric, subsequently led a movement that took control and established the new Islamic Republic of Iran. Tensions with the United States, which had orchestrated the Shah’s rise into power in the first place in 1953, eventually boiled over and resulted in the infamous hostage crisis , where Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans captive for more than a year. Though the U.S. government secured the release of the hostages in January 1981, the United States had, by that time, broken off relations with Iran over the hostage-taking and the two countries have remained at odds ever since. Iran continues to fly its 214A/Cs and has developed indigenous supply chains to keep them going. Blocked from completing its helicopter deal with Iran, but having already completed the bulk of the work on the 214ST with financial help from the Shah’s government, Bell finished development of the helicopter and marketed it alongside the 214B BigLifter , the commercial version of Iran’s 214A. Available with skids or fixed wheels, Bell pitched the 214ST, also first as the Stretched Twin and then as the Super Transporter, in various civilian roles. These included executive transport, forest fire fighting, and supporting offshore oil rigs, logging operations, and other remote commercial enterprises. 214STs, along with 214Bs, continue to perform these types of duties to this day, though in relatively small numbers compared to other Huey variants derivatives. A Bell 214ST in service with Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., or PHI, a contract helicopter operator that continues to operate today supporting offshore oil operations, among other things ., SDASM Archives Bell did continue to offer the 214ST as a military transport, as well. It has seen very limited military service in countries such as Brunei, Peru, Thailand, and Venezuela over the years. In one of life’s little quirks, the largest military operator of the 214ST turned out to be Iraq, which took delivery of nearly 50 of the helicopters during the 1980s and flying them during its brutal war with Iran. The U.S. military would capture one of these during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. US Marines, holding a Kuwaiti flag, stand in front of a captured Iraqi Bell 214ST during Operation Desert Storm in 1991., USMC The U.S. Army did conduct airworthiness testing of the 214ST in the 1980s, but “the helicopter is a commercial aircraft and was not designed for U.S. military use or compliance with U.S. military specifications,” a final test report made clear. “The adequacy of the BHTI [Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.] 214ST helicopter to perform as a military aircraft should not be inferred from the results of this evaluation.” Bell had previously proposed the Model 240 , which also used two T700 engines, for the Army for its Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) program in 1972. The company also pitched the idea of product improved version of the UH-1H helicopter, sometimes referred to as the UH-1H+ . The service decided to go in a different direction and selected what would become the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk as the winner of the UTTAS competition in 1976. But the 214ST has had something of a U.S. military adjacent career with contractors supporting various American operations around the world, including in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Uganda, primarily moving cargo and personnel to and from remote outposts. One of the most prominent operators of these helicopters in this role was Evergreen Helicopters . In 2013, Erikson, Inc. bought Evergreen and has continued to work with the U.S. military, among other customers. An Evergreen Bell 214ST supporting U.S. Marines in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province in 2012., USMC Various firms tied to infamous private military company Blackwater, including Presidential Airways and EP Aviation , also flew the 214ST under contract to the U.S. military in Afghanistan, among other locales. AAR Airlift Group subsequently purchased Presidential Airways and EP Aviation, acquiring their fleets in the process. This company 214STs have notably supported U.S. military activities in Niger, subcontracted to another firm, Berry Aviation . One of these helicopters helped recover the body of U.S. Army Sergeant LaDavid Johnson after the now infamous ambush of American troops near Tongo Tongo in October 2017, an incident you can read more about here and here . A grainy screengrab from an official video presentation regarding the October 2017 incident in Niger showing one of Erickson’s 214ST helicopters in that country., DOD The U.S. Department of State’s Air Wing also flies 214STs. Officially known as Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs’ Office of Aviation, which you can read about in depth here , this is organizations is one of the largest U.S. government aviation arms outside the U.S. military. All told, despite its limited production run, which ran from 1981 until 1993, during which Bell built some 96 examples, the 214ST’s impressive capabilities have kept the helicopters in very active service in many parts of the world, including continued involvement in military operations. Until Bell introduced the 525 Relentless in 2012, the 214ST was the largest helicopter the company had ever made. It’s certainly been an interesting life for a design originally meant specifically for Iran, a customer that then never flew a single one of the helicopters. By every indication, the 214STs will still be thump thump thumping their way through the skies for years to comes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 18, 2019",I Deserve To Have My Ass Kicked By John Wick For Not Taking His Movies Seriously,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A couple of months ago, I was driving to a wedding in Carmel with a good and very long-time friend of mine. We were bullshitting about pretty much everything and having some great laughs as the Northern California scenery blasted by. Movies came up and he asked if I am excited for the new John Wick movie coming out. I laughed in his face, I said “aren’t those like made for video schlock action films? You are kidding right?” He was stunned I hadn’t even seen one! I promised him I would check the first one out when I got home. Thankfully, I remembered to make good on that promise because my assumptions were totally wrong. The first installment of the Keanu Reeves-driven franchise was so interesting that I watched the second the next night. It too was damn good. What I walked away with was the realization that like me, I think many people either misunderstand these films or never even gave them a chance in the first place. They are way smarter than they are made out to be and feature many of the most amazing action sequences I have ever seen in my life. The newest entrant into the saga, John Wick Chapter Three: Parabellum , is no different. In fact, just its title, “Parabellum”—Latin for “prepare for war”—tells the audience what to be ready for and it delivers it in spades. The John Wick franchise is very much a modern and fairly genius reimagining on Japan’s Samurai Cinema genre that had a heavy impact on, and was heavily impacted by, its American counterpart—the Spaghetti Western. Instead of a Ronin wondering the Japanese countryside looking for peace—or revenge— John Wic k does the same on the assassin-filled streets of Manhattan. Handguns largely take the place of samurai swords and assault rifles for arrows. I was introduced to Samurai Cinema via what I thought would be a laughably easy history course in college—yes, University Of Oregon had a 300 level history course called Samurai In Film! It turns out, it was far tougher than I predicted. If you weren’t familiar with Japanese names you were pretty much screwed. It actually ended up being the lowest grade I received during college. How embarrassing is that? Regardless, it was here that the history of and all the themes surrounding Samurai Cinema were beaten into me. With this in mind, while screening the first John Wick installment and sitting there trying to figure out what the hell I was watching, the specters of my scholastic past crept in and I had a nagging sensation that this was all very familiar. Well, it was and in an awesome way. Other influences are there, including some of the violent classics from the 1970s, like Dirty Harry, Enter The Dragon, and revenge genre films like Death Wish— both franchises in their own right. One can’t also help but think of Quentin Tarantino and his love and use of similar genres when evaluating John Wick films, but the connections aren’t direct beyond similar themes and certain reality-bending premises. Another heavy influence on these films is the Film Noire genre and for all the right reasons. As the series progresses, the cinematography and production lean more heavily on this style of atmosphere to spectacular effect. John Wick Chapter Three: Parabellum is a gorgeous film regardless if you like the story, violence, or the entire concept, or not. In fact, it leaps off the screen more than anything I have seen in recent years. Once again there is more going on here than just nonstop action sequences, Keanu Reeves getting slapped around, and exhilarating chases. So, no, John Wick isn’t Fast And The Furious , a film franchise I have come to detest. Far, far from it, in fact. Parabellum is a feast for the eyes. , Summit Entertainment Parabellum even retroactively elevates the first two films that basically set up its premise and do the necessary world building to jump-start what will be the next phase in the John Wick story, which is as much about an alternate reality where a vast and ancient underground network of assassins and their support infrastructure operate all over the globe than it is about a dude caught up in his own nightmare of a revenge arch. This expanding world makes John Wick a richer and more enjoyable franchise as it infuses a comic book vibe into what otherwise would be a most dreary and somewhat confusing affair. Let’s get to the bloody heart of these films—the fight scenes. Actually, they aren’t really fight scenes as much as they are highly choreographed battle ballets. Whereas most fight scenes these days are shot with fast cuts, tons of camera shake, and tight angles, John Wick films go the exact opposite direction. Wide shots that often run uncut for long periods of time turn close-range gunshots, rapid knife strikes, and hand-to-hand violence into a stunning cinematic artform. It’s not just Keanu Reeves’ fantastic and brutal performance that will enthrall you, but all the incredible martial artists and stuntmen and stuntwomen that make it look so… Real. These are incredibly talented athletes doing some remarkably dangerous sequence in an unforgiving filming environment. I can’t stress enough how awesome the casting department is for finding such formidable and colorful opponents for Wick to beat the shit out of. It literally makes these movies. Still, among the hundreds of footsoldiers, ninjas, and cutthroats that Wick takes on in Parabellum , as well as his limited array of reluctant allies, a pair of K9s steals the show entirely . One protracted battle, in particular, has you rooting for a pair of dogs above any human on screen. This is truly creative and fun film making that uses set pieces to shine in unique ways, not just to prime another battle royale and move the plot along to its next stage. Summit Entertainment Don’t get me wrong, John Wick films are not about nitpicking its stutters in realism, in fact, part of the fun is checking that section of your brain at the box office counter. It’s like getting on a great E-ticket ride at a theme park. Yeah, you see the tracks in the darkness and sure you know none of it is real or that realistic, but you are too busy enjoying the bumps, drops, scares, sounds, and awesome surroundings along the way to give a shit. Yet what’s most uncanny about these movies is that they focus your attention is such a way on certain elements and are just plausible enough to keep from forcing your mind into the Fast And The Furious realm of disbelief. This is really another key component to their success. They “don’t jump the shark” necessarily, but they do constantly hop over smaller fish to the point that you don’t really notice it, or you don’t really care. Now onto Keanu. From being such a huge star starting with Bill And Ted’s Excellent Adventure through the Matrix films, he seemed kind of washed up until John Wick matured into what it is now. Looking back, that is also a near criminal assumption. He puts every ounce of himself into these films. It hurts watching nearly every fight sequence even though you know the punches and crashes aren’t supposed to be landing with their full potential in real life. This is ridiculously physical film making and he has become an absolute master at his trade in this regard. Most of all, thank goodness these movies rely heavily on real people and physical effects, not tired and hokey CGI. It literally ups the stakes even though it has nothing to do directly with the screenplay. We want to see real martial artists throwing actual punches and swinging actual swords, not some video game rendition of one (or many!). The production team on John Wick movies get this, or at least they have had to go this route because these movies are made at a fraction of the cost of huge Hollywood blockbusters that actually feature less numerous and lower quality action sequences. Some think Reeves’ lines are corny in John Wick movies—of which there are probably only a couple paragraphs total in each film. But that’s the entire point of the genre and the character. He is a broken man of few to no words, with revenge driving his every act. It’s over the top because it is supposed to be and it works marvelously. Simple statements like “I’m going to,” “no you’re not,” and even “yes” are pivotal moments in the films and they are usually the most fun, too. So, when it comes to Parabellum , you probably have seen many knife fights in movies—but not like this. You have seen loads of motorcycle chases before—but not like this. You have seen a fight underwater before—but NEVER like this. In the end, J ohn Wick Parabellum is by far the best entry into the series. It isn’t perfect, there are some areas that could have been edited down a bit and some unneeded components, but boy is it damn good and I believe it may very well go down as one of the best action movies of all time. At times it is downright beautiful even when it is at its ugliest. But above all else, it’s fun! We are all in on the joke while at the same time respecting what goes into what we are watching at any given time. Few films have achieved such a high-functioning duality. Instead of getting tired as it rolls into its second trilogy, John Wick is getting better with age. Now that it has finally broken through at the box office, and is blowing holes in dumbass preconceived notions like my own, it is downright exciting to think where this ‘little action franchise that could’ goes next.

Commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France during World War II, better known as D-Day, have already been underway for days and will continue for some time. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron both attended a ceremony in Normandy this morning to mark the official beginning of the operation on June 5-6, 1944. This included a massive flyover of French and American military aircraft, consisting in part of a large number of Douglas C-47 transport aircraft, some of which actually took part in the airborne assault three-quarters of a century ago. But what may get overlooked in the events to remember this tide-turning event is just how risky it was and how Allied military and intelligence elements had been conducting massive deception and disinformation campaigns for months ahead of time to ensure Operation Overlord had the best chance of succeeding. These side activities to confuse and disorient the Germans continued right alongside the beginning of the invasion itself, including British forces dumping radar confusing chaff , dummy paratroopers rigged with explosives, as well as Special Air Service (SAS) commandos with loudspeakers to broadcast disorienting recordings, to try to pull German forces away from the real drop zones. The full commemorative flyover in Normandy on June 6, 2019, , which you can watch in the video below, also included more modern U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III and C-130 Hercules transports, the latter of which carried black-and-white “invasion stripes” that Allied aircraft wore to help distinguish them from German planes during the invasion. A U.S. Coast HC-130 rescue aircraft flew over the beach, too, along with four F-15E Strike Eagles , which performed the missing man maneuver to honor the Allied troops who died during the operation. French Mirage 2000 fighter jets, an A400M transport aircraft, and the Alpha Jets of French Air Force’s Patrouille Acrobatique de France demonstration team all took part, as well. There have been other flyovers, in Europe and elsewhere, to mark the D-Day anniversary, as well. On June 5, 2019, six CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors and six MC-130J Commando II special operations transports from the U.S. Air Force’s 352nd Special Operations Wing flew past Duxford in the United Kingdom to commemorate the event. This particular fly-by was in part to mark the contributions of early special operations units that took part in the lead up to D-Day and the invasion itself. These included the Royal Air Force’s No. 3 Group , which oversaw all of the RAF’s “special duties” squadrons tasked with various specialized missions, and the SAS, a legendary organization that served as a basis for modern special operations forces around the world and continues to be a central part of the U.K. military’s special operations community. On the night of June 5, 1944, four squadrons from No. 3 Group – No. 90, No. 138, No. 149, and No. 161 – left their bases in the United Kingdom and began wending their way toward northern France. They were flying a mixture of Handley Page Halifaxes and Short Stirlings , as well as Lockheed Hudsons . The Halifax and Stirling designs had both started life as heavy bombers, but both companies also built variants to carry cargo and drop paratroopers. Variants of the smaller Lockheed Hudson also served in a variety of roles, including as light bombers and light transports. A Handley Page Halifax B.III bomber, similar to the aircraft that squadrons of No. 3 Group flew during Operation Titanic., Crown Copyright At the same time, thousands of Allied paratroopers were also riding in dozens of C-47s, as well as other transport planes and towed gliders, heading for drop zones in Normandy. The 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions would land north of Carentan to the west of the beaches, while the British 6th Airborne Division would drop north of Caen, situated to the east. The mission of the airborne forces was to take control of various strategic points beyond the invasion beaches to stymie German forces and otherwise help pave the way for a breakout into Northern France. No. 3 Group’s planes were following the same general routes, but were not heading to the exact same places and they weren’t carrying any significant numbers of actual troops. They were executing Operation Titanic , a set of ruses to try and draw German forces out of position and away from the actual airborne forces. A map showing the routes that aircraft took during Operation Titanic. Operations Mandrel, Taxable, and Glimmer were other aerial and combined aerial and maritime deception efforts., Bonhams Titanic was among the last thrusts of a larger allied deception effort known as Operation Bodyguard . Early in 1944, amid planning for D-Day, Allied military and intelligence arms had begun a multi-pronged effort to conceal the preparations from the Nazis. To this day, the landings at Normandy remains the largest seaborne invasion in history and the airborne component of Operation Overlord also represents one of the largest such operations ever. This involved assembling massive amounts of ships, aircraft, troops, tanks, and other equipment in position ahead of the operation, something the Germans would be hard pressed to miss. Operation Bodyguard used a host of different tactics, including double agents feeding disinformation invasion plans outside of France and an entire “ Ghost Army ” equipped with things such as inflatable tanks, to throw off the Nazis. The main component of Operation Titanic were drops of approximately 400 dummy paratroopers, nicknamed “ Ruperts ,” in four drop zones across Normandy. These manikins had pyrotechnic noisemakers called pintails that made popping sounds akin to gunfire. Each one also had a small explosive charge, ostensibly to try to conceal evidence of the ruse by destroying the dummy. The timed detonation could also potentially have killed or wounded German forces who went to investigate the purported landings. In addition, No. 3 Group’s aircraft dropped two small SAS teams near the city of Saint-Lô, a major allied objective, ahead of the actual airborne assault there. The commandos used their loudspeakers to broadcast sounds of men shouting and various types of weapon fire to convince the Germans that paratroopers were coming from a different direction. They also engaged in very limited combat against German forces to try to reinforce the ruse. Some of the planes also dropped loads of metalized paper or aluminum strips, known as chaff , which can blind and confuse radar. This component of the operation helped conceal the size of the Operation Titanic force, as well as that of the main airborne armada, and where they were heading. Other units dropped chaff as part of separate deception aerial operations, which also included various maritime ruses, such as mock amphibious landings. Examples of World War II-era British chaff, a technology that U.K. authorities had codenamed “Window.”, Imperial War Museums The exact results of Operation Titanic are hard to deduce, but there is significant evidence that it contributed to German confusion about what was happening and where, all of which would have benefitted the actual airborne operation. Despite having received reports of significant aircraft and ship noise off the coast, Nazi General Hans Speidel , Chief of Staff to Field Marshall Erwin Rommel , head of Army Group B in Northern France, did decrease the alert level for forces in the region after some troops in the field found the dummy paratroopers. At the same time, the SS ordered the entire 12th SS Panzer Division was ordered to respond to another one of the mock landings west of the city of Caen, another major Allied objective. Another regular Wehrmacht infantry regiment, the 915th Grenadier Regiment, found itself hunting ghosts in the woods further rather than heading to the beach to reinforce troops there. A Panzer IV tank, belonging to the 12th SS Panzer Division, in Rouen, France in the weeks following the Allied invasion., Bundesarchiv Unfortunately, despite its success and even though it only involved a limited number of real forces, Operation Titanic was not without its own losses. Two Stirlings from No. 149 squadron got shot down and eight members of the SAS died either in fighting with German forces on the ground or after getting captured and sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. In 1942, the German High Command had decreed in secret that any Allied commandos that its forces captured were to be summarily executed. Fast forward 75 years and deception and psychological warfare remain important, if often obscure components of modern U.S. military operations, as well as those of other countries around the world. Confusing and disorienting the enemy to draw their attention away from actual objectives is just as viable a tactic as it was during the invasion of France. Intelligence agents and other outlets seeding disinformation off the battlefield and troops on the ground using loudspeakers to pump out confusing and disturbing messages continue to be components of modern information and psychological operations. When it comes to D-Day, side efforts such as Operation Titanic only underscore just how massive an undertaking the invasion really was and all the work that occurred on the sidelines to make sure it came off as smoothly as possible. It’s hard to contemplate what would have happened if the invasion had failed. June 6, 1944, is certainly a day worth commemorating, as are the immense sacrifices that Allied forces made on and off the beaches and inside and out of the drop zones in Normandy to help turn the tide of World War II and ultimately bring about the downfall of Nazi Germany. Hopefully, it’s an event that the world will never have to experience again. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Explosives/EOD Land Special Operations Aviation"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In his very first installment as a contributor here at The War Zone , veteran Navy Seahawk pilot Chris “Ox” Harmer tells us why the Navy, which is known for its incredible special operations capabilities, has little dedicated special operations airlift capacity and why Navy SEALs often spend far more time in Army or even Air Force aircraft downrange than they do in Navy ones. Beyond this, Ox gives us a high-level look at how the Navy ended up with just a single special operations-focused helicopter unit, while the Army and Air Force have far greater capacity in this regard. He also explains how all these forces are structured and how all the different special operations ‘customers’ get serviced by the assets at hand. Special ops Seahawk over Iraq. , USN Without further delay, here’s Ox: The Most Famous Special Operations Mission Of Modern Times It was the most famous special operations mission of modern times. Just over eight years ago, on May 2, 2011, a team of Navy SEALS drawn from the secretive Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG), better known as DEVGRU or Seal Team Six, assaulted a walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where they found and killed Osama bin Laden as part of Operation Neptune Spear. The SEALs on the assault team and their backup Quick Response Force (QRF) were flown to and from the raid in two different types of helicopters, MH-47 Chinooks and some highly modified stealth versions of the MH-60 Blackhawk. We know one of the aviation units that flew the helicopters was the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) and it’s possible that another, more secretive unit, the Flight Concepts Division (FCD) also participated. In their own way, the SOAR and FCD are every bit as selective and uniquely qualified as Seal Team Six. The mission was a complete success. At the end of the operation, the most wanted terrorist in history was dead, all the friendlies were back in Afghanistan with no casualties, and the U.S. was in possession of a treasure trove of intel taken from Bin Laden’s home. The only loss was one of the stealth Black Hawks , which is a unique story in its own right. But the fact is that the entire operation was done with Army pilots flying Navy SEALS to and from the compound. MH-60 from the 160th SOAR drops off a Marine Force Recon team via fast rope. , US Army Not Quite Like The Movies Several years later, my then girlfriend and now wife and I were watching Zero Dark Thirty , the movie adaptation of the raid, and she asked me if I had piloted the type of helicopter the SEALs were flying in. I can’t recall if I was trying to be honest or to just curtail the conversation and get back to the movie, but I answered, “sort of.” Mission fail on both objectives as she then started (okay, restarted) an interrogation about my career as a Naval Aviator, flying the SH-60F and HH-60H models of the Seahawk helicopter, that lasted the rest of our dating life and has shown no sign of abating now that we are married. The Cliffs Notes version is, yes, I flew a lot of training missions and exercises with SEALs, and even some real-world operations, but I spent the vast majority of my career in the Navy flying other missions. To the extent that I did fly missions with Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Air Force Pararescuemen (PJs), and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) personnel, it was as a collateral duty or skill set, not the primary mission focus of any of the squadrons I was attached to. One part of the movie and my explanation of it that piqued her interest was the fact that the SEALs were transported to and from the raid in Army helicopters. If Navy SEALs were storming the compound to get Bin Laden, why didn’t Navy pilots fly them? I explained that most Navy helicopter pilots in the Mideast were on ships and that the raid at its closest point to the ocean was well over 700 miles “feet dry,” so the logical solution was to use the Army helicopters and pilots that were already there in Afghanistan or were familiar with the operation and the area it was going to take place. Also, the fact that secret stealth Blackhawks were available was clearly also a unique factor. Beyond all that, I pointed out that this particular Army helicopter unit, the 160th SOAR, had a single mission focus in life, flying special operations missions, and they were extremely good at it. They also had the best equipment for the job. Had the 160th not been available, an equally capable unit, the Air Force’s 20th Special Operations Squadron, flying the CV-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, would probably have been the next logical choice, assuming the mission was willing to accept the risk of a less stealthy airframe than the highly modified stealth Blackhawks that were used. This sparked her next question—if the Army and Air Force have dedicated aviation units to support their Special Operations Forces (SOF), why doesn’t the Navy? And what about the Marine Corps? The answer to that question is complicated. An Army 160th SOAR MH-47 works with Navy special operations boat teams in Moses Lake, Washington. , US Army A Massive Special Operations Force Structure The U.S. military has a massive special operations force structure, led by a dedicated Unified Combatant Command, United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM or SOCOM). Each of the four military services is represented in SOCOM with a component command, including the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), United States Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), and Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). [Editor’s note: SOCOM also contains the secretive joint service Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which includes the Aviation Tactics Evaluation Group (AVTEG). AVTEG is understood to exercise command and control over a number of top-secret special operations aviation units, such as FCD, and otherwise coordinate aviation support for JSOC. You can read more about AVTEG and its associated units here .] USASOC and AFSOC are both large component commands; USASOC has an authorized end strength of over 30,000 uniformed personnel and AFSOC has an authorized end strength of over 15,000 uniformed personnel. In contrast, NSWC has an authorized end strength of less than 10,000 uniformed personnel, and MARSOC less than 5,000 uniformed personnel. Along with being responsible for all U.S. military special operations, SOCOM also coordinates with non-military federal agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) Special Activities Center (SAC) . 160th SOAR MH-6 Little Bird and Army special operators in action. , SOCOM Dedicated SOF Aviation Support: Army And Air Force Have It, Navy & Marines, Not So Much A big part of the massive U.S. special operations footprint is dedicated aviation support for special operations forces (SOF).  The component commands handle this responsibility very differently, at least partially due to their differing sizes. In the case of USASOC and AFSOC, those component commands, in turn, have subordinate elements whose only, or at least primary, responsibility is providing aviation support to SOF, and are directly responsible to SOCOM to do that.  Without listing all of those subordinate elements, AFSOC has a number of squadrons that provide fixed wing, tiltrotor, and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) support to SOF. The Army’s contribution in this regard is the 160th SOAR. While both AFSOC and SOAR occasionally support missions that are not SOF centric, they do so only on a “not to interfere” basis with their core mission, which is to be trained and ready to support the full spectrum of SOF aviation support missions. The fact is, while Navy SEALs train on a regular basis with Navy helicopter squadrons and occasionally with fixed-wing Navy cargo squadrons flying the C-130 Hercules and C-2 Greyhounds , they currently wind up flying a majority of their actual combat missions on Army helicopters or Air Force fixed wing support platforms like the MC-130H Combat Talon II, MC-130J Commando II, and the CV-22 Osprey tiltrotor. CV-22s at the U.S. Air Force Academy., USAF Navy And Marine Corps Provide Aviation Support To SOF “Out Of Hide” Compared to USASOC and AFSOC, NSWC and MARSOC are much smaller, and neither NSWC nor MARSOC have any dedicated aviation support for SOF in their component command structure. This isn’t to say the Navy doesn’t provide aviation operations support to the SEALs. It does, just in a very different manner than the Army and Air Force. At least partially because NSWC and MARSOC are so much smaller than USASOC and AFSOC, the Navy and Marine Corps simply can’t afford or justify dedicated aviation support units in their SOCOM component commands.  As a result, the majority of training and exercise support the Navy provides to NSWC comes from active duty Navy helicopter squadrons that support NSW/SOF “out of hide,” as a collateral duty, in addition to their other missions. The same norm applies for Marine helicopter support to MARSOC units. While active duty Navy helicopter squadrons train to NSW/SOF support as a “primary mission,” it is one of several primary missions, along with maritime Search and Rescue (SAR), Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Anti Surface Warfare (ASUW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and logistics. As a practical matter, this means that active duty Navy helicopter squadrons are significantly less proficient in the SOF support mission than SOAR or AFSOC. During pre-deployment training and exercises, Navy helicopter squadrons provide the majority of training services to the SEALS, but with so many SEAL deployments being land-based since 9/11, when it comes to actual combat operations, AFSOC and SOAR wind up providing most of that support. That is a result of both proximity—AFSOC and SOAR are present in the land-centric SOF missions SEALS are being used for—as well as proficiency. AFSOC and SOAR are simply more proficient at high-intensity SOF support missions than Navy helicopter squadrons. MH-60S executing vertical replenishment at sea., USN Navy Dedicated Support Is a Single Reserve Squadron, Marines Have Nothing The Navy does maintain a single reserve aviation squadron dedicated specifically to SOF support. The “Firehawks” of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85 (HSC-85) stationed at Naval Air Station North Island, California, are tasked with providing training and exercise support to NSWC, just down the beachline at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. HSC-85 has an excellent reputation, but is limited in what it can do at least partially because that squadron does not belong to NSWC. On the Navy’s organization chart, it belongs to the Navy’s Helicopter Sea Combat Wing, Pacific. As a practical matter, that distinction means that in terms of Naval Aviation’s budget requests, funding for SOF aviation support is at or near the bottom of the priorities list. This is in contrast to USASOC and AFSOC, which provide dedicated funding and equipment support for their SOF-centric aviation commands. This, in turn, means the Navy’s aviation equipment in the SOF support mission is not as advanced as that used by SOAR and AFSCOC. This difference in equipment manifests itself most obviously in two areas—i n-flight refueling and Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE). HSC-85 is equipped with the MH-60S Seahawk. It is an adequate platform for SOF support, but is limited compared to the equipment used by SOAR and AFSCOC. For example, the MH-60S is not capable of inflight refueling. For maritime centric NSW/SOF operations where the “mother ship” hosting the MH-60S can move within a relatively close distance of the target, the limited range of the MH-60S is not an issue. For longer-range SOF support missions, the fact that SOAR MH-47 Chinooks, MH-60 Blackhawks, and AFSOC CV-22 Ospreys are capable of in-flight refueling gives those platforms a much bigger radius of action. In terms of ASE, Navy helicopters are equipped with the standard suite of chaff and flare dispensers, Infra-Red Guided Missile Countermeasures (IRCM), Radar Warning Receivers (RWR), but when upgrades become available, they are typically last in line to get the new or upgraded equipment. The Marine Corps has no aviation squadrons assigned exclusively to MARSOC, neither active duty or reserves. This is partially because the Marine Corps, like the Navy, simply can’t afford or justify dedicated aviation SOF units given the small overall size of MARSOC, but there is another reason for this. The Marine Corps has always seen its Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) units as integral to the mission of the Marine Corps and skeptical of placing them under joint command and losing control of them. Indeed, MARSOC did not stand up and join SOCOM until 2006, at which point the Marine FORECON community was split into two groups, with FORECON units remaining integral to the Marine Corps and the newly formed Raider Regiment and subordinate commands joining SOCOM. DoD For Navy, It’s All About The Force Structure The vast majority of Navy helicopter squadrons are organized into one of two “type wings”—Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) Wing and Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) Wing—with each Wing having a Pacific Fleet and Atlantic Fleet component headquarters. HSC squadrons fly the MH-60S version of the Seahawk and HSM squadrons fly the MH-60R version of the Seahawk. Both of these versions of the Seahawk are incredibly effective in their primary roles, but unlike several airframes operated by the Army and Air Force, neither version of the Seahawk was intended exclusively for NSW/SOF support. The MH-60R is equipped with a surface search radar, Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), sonobuoy launcher, dipping sonar, and all the equipment necessary to process and relay all the data generated by those advanced onboard and offboard sensors. In terms of armament, it can carry a mix of lightweight torpedoes, Hellfire missiles, 2.75-inch rockets, and one crew-served machine gun. As far as its overwater capabilities go, the MH-60R is the most advanced rotary wing platform in the world. If you are looking to search, detect, track, and kill enemy surface ships or submarines, the MH-60R is an extremely capable Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform. While these capabilities are impressive and necessary for the Navy, they leave the MH-60R extremely limited on space and typically with a pretty narrow margin for additional weight. If MH-60R squadrons are tasked with supporting NSW/SOF missions, they are limited to a relatively small personnel footprint in the cabin, perhaps a couple of command and communication personnel or a sniper/spotter team. The most obvious use for the MH-60R in NSW/SOF support is as an airborne command platform, reconnaissance asset, sniper perch, or weapons delivery platform. Both it and its predecessor, the SH-60B, have seen extensive use in these roles. The MH-60S is designed primarily to support logistics, carrying internal and external loads from shore-to-ship and ship-to-ship, allowing sustained maritime operations at sea without warships needing to return to port. The MH-60S is also the Navy’s primary platform for overwater search and rescue and medical evacuations, as well as overland Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR). Lacking all the sonar and surveillance equipment that the MH-60R has, the MH-60S has much more internal room and carrying capacity, and has two stations for door gunners, allowing crewmen to operate machine guns simultaneously with personnel getting into/out of the aircraft. Like the MH-60R, the MH-60S can carry Hellfire, 2.75-inch rockets, and crew-served machine guns, both 7.62mm and .50 caliber. The primary use of an MH-60S in NSW/SOF support is as a flying truck, taking SEALS into and out of battle and as a sniper and weapons delivery platform. Both it and its predecessor, the HH-60H, have extensive use in these roles. While both of these platforms are capable of NSW/SOF support, they were built primarily for other missions. More importantly, while their active duty crews are trained to do NSW/SOF support, that is only one of several Primary Mission Areas (PRIMARS) that they train to regularly. A ‘Sierra’ is loaded with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. , USN At Sea, Navy Supports, But Overland, Army And Air Force Take the Lead So why doesn’t the Navy maintain more than just a single reserve squadron to support NSW/SOF operations? It certainly is not because there is no need for it. Navy SEALs are in constant need of aviation platforms to support their training requirements, not to mention their real-world operations. Aside from the budget constraints, the next most obvious answer is the Navy treats aviation support for NSW/SOF as two separate issues. The first is the core maritime special operations mission that Naval Aviation can support “out of hide” with existing squadrons. In this role, Navy helicopter squadrons play a primary, almost exclusive role in maritime-centric special operations missions, which center around various iterations of the Maritime Interdiction Operation (MIO) mission and the Visit Board Search Seizure (VBSS) mission. While the frequency of these missions varies with external factors, for all practical purposes the Navy has been conducting MIO and VBSS missions more or less continuously since 2001 in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, the Somali Basin, the Red Sea, and the Southwest Pacific. For these missions, the existing sea-based Navy helicopter squadrons do most of the support of NSW/SOF operations. The second are the deep overland missions that are currently taking place in Afghanistan and to a lesser extent Syria. For these persistent, overland special operations-centric campaigns, Navy SEALs are supporting a land-centric fight, so they wind up using land-centric aviation infrastructure from AFSOC and USASOAC. For all practical purposes, Naval Aviation provides no support to these campaigns at all. HSC-85 MH-60S hovers over a group of Marine Raiders. , USN Dedicated Navy Helicopter Support During Operation Iraqi Freedom Naval Aviation force structure is simply not set up to provide dedicated, ongoing aviation support to SOF. However, during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), when it became apparent that the SEAL mission in Iraq was going to be long term and continuous, thus requiring ongoing dedicated support, the Navy used two of its reserve helicopter squadrons to set up a single detachment in Iraq that essentially served continuously for the duration of active U.S. combat operations from 2003 to 2011. At the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the two Navy reserve helicopter squadrons that were dedicated solely to SOF support were the HCS-4 Red Wolves, stationed at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia, and the HCS-5 Firehawks, stationed at Naval Air Station North Island, California. As part of the Navy’s restructuring effort of its helicopter force, these squadrons were eventually redesignated HSC-84 and HSC-85. Both of these squadrons were descendants of Helicopter Attack Light (HAL) Three, the Navy’s active duty helicopter squadron that supported SOF operations during the Vietnam War. Public Domain Both these squadrons supplied airframes, aviators, and maintainers to sustain a nearly continuous presence in Iraq for just under nine years. They were stationed at various times in Kuwait, Baghdad, and Balad. Although much of the detachment’s operational history in Iraq remains classified, we do know they flew a total of approximately 13,800 flight hours, completing 2,300 missions supporting special operations, with approximately 1,200 missions consisting of Direct Action (DA) operations targeting enemy combatants. Those DA missions resulted in hundreds of high-value targets captured or killed. By all accounts, the detachment performed exceptionally well. HSC-85 spooling up., USN The Budget Axe Falls – Big Navy Disestablishes HSC-84 While working in the J5 (Strategic Plans and Policy) directorate of the Joint Staff in the Pentagon, one of my superiors commented that “The budget is the policy.” That’s a pithy way of saying if you want to know what an organization really values, look what it spends money on. By 2013, Big Navy was in a serious budget crunch and started looking at disestablishing both HSC-84 and HSC-85. The view from the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) staff was simple. The USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), the lead ship in the new class of supercarriers designed to replace the Nimitz class was way over budget and behind schedule . The F-35 was also way over budget and behind timeline. There were a number of other pressing budget issues—the Littoral Combat Ship and Zumwalt class destroyers programs were well behind their timelines to meet performance parameters.  Ultimately, Big Navy decided to shut down both squadrons. To be clear, this was never anything but a budget decision. NSWC made the case, repeatedly, that dedicated helicopter support was essential to their pre-deployment training and exercise program. They could survive on deployment with flight support from SOAR and AFSOC. Getting through workups prior to deployment was going to be nigh on impossible without these dedicated squadrons. Ostensibly, Big Navy offered to keep both squadrons if SOCOM paid part of the bill. That offer and or agreement, depending on whose version of the story you believe, was never formalized. Ultimately, after a heavy lobbying campaign, Big Navy reluctantly agreed to keep HSC-85. HSC-84 was disestablished in 2016. Navy SEALs fast rope from a HSC-85 MH-60S.  , USN The Future of Naval Aviation Support For SOF Navy active duty helicopter squadrons currently provide support for NSW/SOF in training and exercise situations, and to a limited extent and for a limited mission set, they also perform actual missions. With that said, those active duty Navy helicopter squadrons have a multitude of other missions competing for their focus and flight hours. Additionally, flying NSW/SOF missions requires a significant amount of focus and training time in order to gain the required expertise. For the foreseeable future, the demand signal to have at least one Navy helicopter squadron dedicated solely to NSW/SOF support will be significant.

Today, the U.S. Navy’s quartet of converted Ohio class nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs, are among America’s most powerful, in-demand, and flexible weapons. These giant and secretive submarines are known for their ability to carry up to 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and dozens of special operations frogmen into contested territory to ply their quiet trade, but really, they are much, much more than that. A decade and a half ago, the U.S. Navy was testing incredible new capabilities that it would subsequently integrate into its four yet to be converted SSGNs, including one highly elaborate, but obscure proof of concept exercise that solidified the SSGN concept for the seagoing service. Here is the story of how these vessels came to be and the highly unique, if not exotic capabilities, from drone mothership to command and control center, they possess. The Genesis of the Ohio SSGN The decision to covert Ohio class SSBNs into SSGNs originated with the 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, which determined that only 14 of the 18 Ohio class boats were necessary to meet the United States’ nuclear deterrence needs. Eight years later, the Navy began actually converting the four oldest Ohio class submarines – USS Florida , USS Georgia , USS Michigan , and USS Ohio – into the new configuration. Ohio , when she was an SSBN, marking the completion of her 50th nuclear deterrent patrol in 1998. Members of her crew are seen standing on the deck spelling out “fifty” for the occasion., USN The Navy had considered a number of potential configuration options for the new SSGNs. The concept that the service finally settled on retained 22 of the 24 missile tubes found on Ohio SSBNs, but modified them so that they were unable to fire Trident D5 nuclear-tipped submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Instead, each one would be able to launch up to seven BGM-109 Tomahawks using a Multiple All-Up-Round Canister (MAC) adapter. The SLBM fire control systems were similarly replaced with ones for the Tomahawk. A schematic showing the elements of the SSGN conversion plan the Navy settled on for the four Ohio class submarines., USN Tubes one and two on each of the four SSGNs would be completely replaced with lockout chambers so combat divers and Navy SEALs could enter and exit the submarine underwater. Personnel could also install a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) to the top of the hull linked to either one of these modified tubes, or both if required, which could accommodate swimmer delivery vehicle (SDV) mini-submarines. As the name suggests, the DDS provides a fully enclosed, dry space to work in on the submarine’s deck, even while it is underwater. ABC News ’ David Muir just recently got a chance to go aboard the USS Florida , providing a behind the scenes look at the interior of one of the converted SSGNs in its present configuration, which you can see in the video below. The abortive Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) was supposed to have been able to directly dock with either one of these lockout chambers, as well. The Navy canceled the ASDS program in 2009 after cost overruns and other major setbacks, including a fire that had destroyed the original prototype the year before. With a DDS installed, a number of additional tubes on the SSGNs would also be blocked off, so the Navy decided to make tubes three through 10 reconfigurable into storage space, if necessary. A dedicated berthing area for a typical contingent of 66 special operators, with a surge capacity of up 102 personnel, was added in the reconfigured missile compartment, as well. A US Navy diver sits in the DDS on the USS Ohio as the submarine sits pierside in Busan, South Korea in 2008. A Mk 8 SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) mini-submarine is visible behind him on a docking platform that extends out of the rear of the shelter., USN More recent reporting has indicated that a typical load for these submarines is around 100 Tomahawks . This most likely represents between 14 and 16 fully loaded tubes, which would equate to between 98 and 112 missiles in total. This would leave between six and eight tubes available for storage or other purposes, something we will come back to later on in the story. Beyond that, the SSGN configuration had an all-new a dedicated special operations mission control center and associated mission planning spaces. It also included additional and improved sensor and communications antenna masts on the sail. Other modifications that would allow these submarines to better operate in shallower waters closer to shore, were also likely involved with the conversion. A rich history of special mission submarines The Navy had substantial past experience with employing submarines as special operations motherships and in the tactical strike role, to say nothing of using them as specialized covert intelligence gathering platforms , when it had crafted the requirements for the Ohio SSGNs. The ability of a submarine, in general, to transport personnel and materiel, as well as launch raiding parties ashore, while using its inherent capabilities to help avoid detection, was well established by the end of World War II. Between the mid-1950s and early 1960s, the Navy, in cooperation with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and U.S. Air Force, had even used submarines to secretly launch radar-reflecting balloons to probe hostile air defense capabilities. You can read more about these operations in this past War Zone story . By the Vietnam War, the Navy was using specially configured submarines to support special operations. These included Gato class USS Tunny and the first-in-class USS Grayback , both of which were diesel-electric submarines that had previously been configured to fire the Regulus nuclear-armed cruise missile. The USS Grayback in 1982., USN The “hangars” on the decks of these submarines for the airplane-sized Regulus were well suited to modification into lockout chambers for swimmers and shelters for mini-submarines , just like the Ohio ’s Trident tubes. In 1968, the Navy went so far as to designate them LPSSs, or amphibious transport submarines. These boats supported special operations along the coast of North Vietnam and also helped gather intelligence. Grayback was notably involved in Operation Thunderhead in 1972, an attempt to rescue American aviators that the U.S. military believed had escaped from North Vietnam’s infamous Hanoi Hilton prison. Bad weather and other factors eventually led the Navy to abort the mission and SEALs and Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) members never made contact with any escapees. One SEAL, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Melvin Spence Dry, died during the mission. The U.S. military only acknowledged the operation in 2008, at which time Dry received a posthumous Bronze Star. SEALs on board Grayback ahead of Operation Thunderhead. Lieutenant Melvin Spence Dry is seated at center with papers in his hands., USN In the decades after Vietnam, a number of Sturgeon class nuclear-powered attack submarines also served in similar special operations support roles. In something of prelude to the Ohio SSGNs, as part of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, or SALT I agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1981, the Navy disabled the SLBM capabilities on a number of SSBNs, reclassifying them officially as attack submarines. USS Sam Houston , USS John Marshall , USS Kamehameha , and USS James K. Polk – the first two belonging to the Ethan Allen class and the latter pair being from the Benjamin Franklin class – received further modifications that added DDSs to the top of the hull and dedicated spaces to carry embarked SEAL teams. These submarines continued sailing into the 1990s and Kamehameha was the last to leave service, with the Navy only decommissioning her in 2002. USS Kamehameha , with twin dry deck shelters installed, in Guam in 2001., USN A new kind of submarine mothership Still, while the Navy had decades of experience with using submarines to support tactical operations, including special operations, at sea and onshore, the Ohio SSGNs aimed to be far more robust and flexible multi-mission platforms than any of these previous conversions. As of 2004, the service was still very much fleshing out the specifics of the SSGN conversion and “writing the manual” on how to then employ these submarines. Georgia had become the main testbed for what was still very much an evolving concept, receiving a number of interim modifications including reconfigured internal mission spaces and additional data links and communications equipment. At that time, none of the four chosen Ohios had gone through the full conversion process and they were still years away from actually entering service in their new configuration. “Two years from now, when we open the wrapping paper to see USS Georgia , a brand-spanking-new SSGN, we are going to need an instruction manual,” U.S. Navy Commodore Robert Shuetz, then-commander of Submarine Squadron 17, said at a change-of-command ceremony for the submarine in December 2004. “A manual that hasn’t been written yet; a manual that will describe in excruciating detail how this new ‘toy’ will be operated.” “This is where the crew of Georgia has excelled,” Shuetz continued. “They have written the first instruction manual for how this ship and her three sisters, the ‘toys’ in demand by every combat commander, will be operated.” Silent Hammer Two months earlier, off the coast of San Diego, California, Georgia , even without anything near the full suite of capabilities outlined in the conversion plan, had demonstrated just what the SSGN configuration might be capable of as part of an experiment nicknamed Silent Hammer . To enhance the realism of the scenario, the Navy inserted this test into a larger exercise, called Trident Warrior, that involved an array of other submarines, ships, aircraft, drones, and special operations forces (SOF). The Silent Hammer scenario, which lasted a little over a week, involved a joint task force with Georgia in the lead locating and neutralizing mock terrorists on land and at sea. The “red team” occupied various sites on San Clemente Island, situated some 80 miles west of San Diego, which the U.S. military routinely uses for exercise and other test purposes . The contractor-operated offshore support vessel, the R/V Acoustic Explorer , also served as a simulated maritime threat. The overall objective of the exercise for the “blue team” was to find and fix these faux militants using a variety of intelligence sources and then neutralize them with simulated Tomahawk strikes. Imagery taken by various platforms of the R/V Acoustic Explorer (AX) and the Weapons of Mass Effect (WME) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) facilities on San Clemente Island, all of which were under the control of “terrorists” during the Silent Hammer exercise., MIT Lincoln Lab During the experiment, at least publicly, the focus was far more on the submarine’s ability to act as an intelligence-collection platform, as well as a broader “clandestine sea-base” that would provide a “headquarters node from which command and control operations and logistic support were conducted,” including for special operators ashore. “Our converted Tridents will generate their own intelligence, which allows onboard commanders to make decisions about what’s needed and determine what additional organic sensors should be deployed in virtually any scenario,” by-then-retired U.S. Navy Admiral Frank “Skip” Bowman wrote, referring to the Ohios collectively by the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles that the SSBN versions carry, said in the Winter 2005 edition of Undersea Warfare magazine, the official publication of the U.S. Navy’s Submarine Force. Bowman’s last position in the service had been as Director of Naval Nuclear Propulsion. “Silent Hammer demonstrated how a networked force, including sea-based SOF from an SSGN, can fill joint gaps – Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and Time Sensitive Strike – by conducting large-scale clandestine operations, supported by advanced unmanned systems, to reduce risk and increase capability,” U.S. Navy Captain J.S. Davidson, who headed up the Silent Hammer experiment, had explained in another interview for another story in that same issue of Undersea Warfare . An intelligence nerve center It’s hard to overstate how significant the intelligence fusion capabilities demonstrated during Silent Hammer were. For the experiment, Georgia had an embarked joint service command team onboard, who used modified spaces in the submarine to run a forward operations center that controlled other assets under the waves, riding on the surface, in the air, and on land. This was intended to reflect the capabilities that the submarine would have after going through the SSGN conversion, which would create new, more robust mission spaces for command and control elements and intelligence gathering personnel, among others. This was the first time the Navy had ever done this as part of the development of the SSGN concept of operations and it put the operational commanders right in the thick of things in a whole new way. Unlike traditional surface command ships, such as the USS Blue Ridge , the Georgia was allowing these officers and their staff to direct forward operations while sailing concealed below the surface of the ocean. The submarine’s command center was linked to rear command centers, and their intelligence networks, via satellite. It also had direct data-link feeds from a number of other sources. A diagram showing the extensive intelligence network employed during Silent Hammer., MIT Lincoln Lab In the air, these included the Pelican , a highly modified, pilot-optional Cessna 337 propeller-driven aircraft, and a specially configured Sabreliner twin-engine business jet. The Pelican belonged to the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School’s Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) and was configured at the time in a way that matched the capabilities of the MQ-1 Predator drone . The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory operated the Sabreliner as a surrogate for smaller, lower-altitude unmanned aircraft. A briefing slide giving an overview of the CIRPAS Pelican., USN The Lincoln Lab also had their heavily modified Boeing 707 airliner, nicknamed Hannah , a well-known cutting-edge communications and sensor testbed, in the air playing the role of a airborne radar with synthetic aperture and ground-moving-target indicator capabilities. This effectively made it, in part, a surrogate for a U.S. Air Force E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management command and control aircraft. The Lincoln Lab’s modified Boeing 707 sensor testbed, nicknamed Hannah., Massachusetts Air And Space Museum Examples of the imagery that the MIT Lincoln Lab’s platforms produced during Silent Hammer., MIT Lincoln Lab Navy EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare planes and EP-3E Aries II intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft also took part in Trident Warrior and fed information into this network of information sources. Down below, Georgia was networked together with other vessels taking part in Trident Warrior, including two Los Angeles class fast attack submarines, the USS La Jolla and USS Pittsburgh . In addition, members of the Silent Hammer experiment team were on board the first in class amphibious assault ship USS Tarawa and the Wasp class USS Bonhomme Richard , which were also taking part in the larger exercise. Ashore, U.S. Navy SEALs, along with other unspecified attached special operators, likely including U.S. Air Force Joint Tactical Air Controllers (JTAC), were in direct contact with Georgia . They emplaced their own “unattended” sensors to monitor for potential hostile activity and otherwise fed even more data back to the submarine. We also know that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) supplied unspecified payloads, as well as sensor systems for the exercise. Georgia itself demonstrated how she might launch unmanned aircraft and an unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) during the exercise to support intelligence collection efforts. We will talk more about these shadowy developments later on. Data fusion pioneers The amount of intelligence information collected during the exercise was staggering. The supporting aircraft, ground sensors, and other offboard sensors collected more than 21,000 individual images during the exercise. In total, the task force created nearly 11 gigabytes of data, including thousands of textual alerts and nearly 3,000 actual intelligence “products,” such as PowerPoint presentations distilling various pieces of information, according to an article in a 2007 edition of the Lincoln Laboratory Journal . Unfortunately, this wealth of information also risked being overwhelming. So, the Navy and the Lincoln Lab had also developed a computerized and heavily automated network system, state-of-the-art for the time, that allowed the command center onboard Georgia to rapidly parse through the mountains of available information for the most relevant data and only download what they needed in full. Being able to avoid downloading unnecessary information was particularly important given the bandwidth limitations in the data links available between the submarine and its various offboard information sources, especially 15 years ago. A breakdown of the information flow between Georgia and the various intelligence gathering assets during Silent Hammer., MIT Lincoln Lab What the actual search interface looked like to operators on Georgia ., MIT Lincoln Lab Silent Hammer planners, as well as the Lincoln Lab, had been acutely aware of data sharing issues based on lessons learned from a smaller SSGN developmental experiment in 2003, nicknamed Giant Shadow , which involved the USS Florida and took place in and around the secretive Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, or AUTEC , off the coast of Andros Island in the Bahamas. Similar to the Silent Hammer scenario, Giant Shadow centered on an operation to destroy a chemical weapons plant that mock terrorists were operating on shore. “We can get this [imagery] real-time down to the submarine,” U.S. Navy Captain William Toti, then commander of the Florida , said in an interview at the time with “60 Minutes” on CBS News . “The SEALs can look at it real-time as they’re planning their missions, and have a better sense of what’s going on.” The problem in that exercise, as it turned out, had been that there quickly became too much information for personnel on the submarine to sift through and process in real-time. “The providers, not the consumers, decided what information to transmit and when, which created a situation whereby analysts were overloaded with processing extraneous information, yet still had insufficient information for decision support,” according to the 2017 Lincoln Laboratory Journal article. The flow of information during Silent Hammer was better, but still showed room for improvement. The vast quantities of data meant that it was still easy for intelligence officers to miss important new developments as they did their best to prioritize the efforts. Of the more than 21,000 images that various platforms collected during the exercise, less than 7,000 made their way into the networked database and “blue team” personnel only ever looked at 361 of them at any resolution, downloading just 45 of them in full for more extensive analysis. Still, the task force that Georgia led was ultimately able to find all of the simulated threats and successfully carry out the mock strikes to neutralize them. A full breakdown of intelligence collected during Silent Hammer., MIT Lincoln Lab A flowchart showing how the intelligence from various sources eventually produced targeting grade information for simulated strikes on San Clemente Island during Silent hammer., MIT Lincoln Lab Secretive payloads For how much is known about Georgia ’s participation in Silent Hammer, as well as the overall scope and scale of the intelligence gathering and networking systems employed during the exercise, there is little information about the testing of the submarine’s capabilities to launch underwater unmanned vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned aircraft. It’s not clear what type or types of UUVs participated in Silent Hammer, or if Georgia deployed any of them herself. However, during the earlier Giant Shadow exercise, Florida had become the first Navy submarine to launch and recover the Seahorse Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) via a modified missile tube. It is very possible that this undersea drone took part in Silent Hammer, as well. The Seahorse AUV., USN The Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at the Pennsylvania State University had begun development of Seahorse in 1999 under contract to the Naval Oceanographic Office, or NAVOCEANO. At 28 and a half feet long and weighing 10,800 pounds, this underwater drone was more than 10 feet longer than a Mk 48 heavyweight torpedo and just over 7,100 pounds heavier. Its main job was undersea mapping using a variety of sensors, including multi-beam bathymetric and synthetic aperture sonars, an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) sensor. Those same sensors could be used to scout out mines and other potential underwater hazards and, in the decades since the Navy took delivery of Seahorse, the service has acquired and fielded a large number of increasingly more capable torpedo-shaped UUVs of various sizes for mapping and mine clearance missions, among others. The Flexible Payload Module Georgia didn’t actually launch any unmanned aircraft during Silent Hammer, according to the Navy, but did release two Stealthy Affordable Capsule System (SACS) canisters, each containing an “inert test shape simulating a UAV,” from a Flexible Payload Module (FPM) installed in one of the submarine’s missile tubes. Since the 1990s, the Navy had been very interested in the idea of pairing unmanned aircraft with submarines to expand the ability of the boats to scout ahead and collect intelligence. Drones working with subs could also act as communications and data relays, probe and collect information on enemy defenses, and potentially even strike targets themselves. For example, in March 1996, the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS Chicago took part in a demonstration in which it tested its ability to both communicate with and actively control an early example of what was then known as the RQ-1 Predator . Development of the FPM dates back to at least 2000, when the Navy tasked two separate industry consortiums with crafting concepts for future submarines designs, as well as payloads and sensors for them, with an eye toward technologies that could be operational in the years to come. The Navy and DARPA managed this project, aptly named Submarine Payloads and Sensors, cooperatively. General Dynamics Electric Boat Northrop Grumman, a member of Team 2020, one of the consortiums, which Lockheed Martin headed up, developed the FPM. General Dynamics Electric Boat, the United States’ premier submarine builder, which had built the Ohios , among others, and was involved in the development of the Virginia class attack submarine at the time, was also part of Team 2020. The FPM was effectively an insert that would slot into a large diameter ballistic missile tube on a submarine, but could be adapted to hold multiple payloads, including numerous unmanned aircraft, that the crew could then launch independently. General Dynamics Electric Boat described it as a “plug and fight” system. General Dynamics Electric Boat Northrop Grumman designed the first iteration, which had 10 14-inch tubes and a pair of larger 20-inch ones, specifically around the dimensions of the Ohio ’s missile tubes. The second FPM prototype, which Georgia carried during Silent Hammer, had only three tubes of an unknown diameter. Each one of those could accommodate a payload inside a SACS, another Northrop Grumman development. General Dynamics Electric Boat “The FPM and SACS comprise an encapsulation system that facilitates the launch of non-marinized payloads and weapons from a submarine,” according to the article on Silent Hammer from the Winter 2005 issue of Undersea Warfare . “This allows the use of Navy air- or surface-launched payloads – plus those from other services – without the need to redesign them for launching in an undersea environment.” SACS was “adaptable for long-term storage, variable release depths, launching under broaching or surface-loitering conditions, and the ability to encapsulate small or large payloads,” according that same article. “In the case of the SUAV [submarine-launched unmanned air vehicle], SACS rises buoyantly to the surface, a sensor in the capsule detects broach, the SACS end-cap is blown away, and the SUAV booster ignites to clear the water and build vertical speed,” notes from a presentation that Steve Weinstein and William McGannon gave at the National Defense Industry Association’s (NDIA) 2002 Joint Undersea Warfare Technology Spring Conference explains. “At the proper moment, the SUAV wings are extended from alongside its long slender body to the horizontal position, the flight control software tilts the SUAV over to the horizontal flight position and once in stable flight, the SUAV turns and climbs to the pre-planned altitude to begin its mission.” At the time, Weinstein and McGannon were employed with the Naval Sea Systems Command’s (NAVSEA) Submarine Sensor Systems division. The other industry collective that had taken part in the Submarine Payloads and Sensors program, called Forward Payloads And Sensors for Submarines (Forward PASS), had developed a similar system, known as the Broaching Universal Buoyant Launcher (BUBL), that worked in much the same manner. However, BUBL’s design was meant to work with a variety of existing launcher options on submarines, including torpedo tubes and countermeasures launchers, or even be carried externally. Of course, the external carriage option could have created performance problems or increased the sub’s acoustic signature, making it more vulnerable. A briefing slide from 2002 offering basic information and graphics regarding FPM, SACS, and BUBL., USN Raytheon was the team leader for Forward PASS, which also included Boeing and Pennsylvania State’s Applied Research Laboratory, among others. General Dynamics Electric Boat was part of both teams in order to provide its extensive knowledge base to help with submarine development and integration questions. There is no mention of Georgia employing BUBL during Silent Hammer. Submarine-launched drones While we don’t know what drones Georgia was supposed to have been simulating the launch of from the FPM specifically, Northrop Grumman had also already developed at least one submarine-launched drone known as Sea Ferret in the 1990s. This was an evolution of Ferret, which the company had originally developed for the U.S. Army. The Sundstrand TJ50 turbojet-powered Ferrets and Sea Ferrets are what we would call loitering munitions today. The approximately 145-pound drones carried both electro-optical sensor packages and 20-pound warheads and could fly out to a maximum range of around 370 nautical miles and a top speed of 300 knots and still be able to orbit around a target area for around two hours. A very low-quality image of Ferret., Public Domain In December 1996, the USS Asheville , another Los Angeles class attack submarine, simulated launching the Sea Ferret during a technology demonstration. A Cessna 206 light aircraft carried one of the drones under its wing to then simulate the unmanned aircraft in flight. Northrop Grumman had intended the final system, which the Navy did not ultimately adopt, to be torpedo tube-launched using a modified canister for a UGM-84 submarine-launched Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile. Still, the 1996 test “successfully simulated organic and inorganic UAV operations & SOF support,” according to Weinstein and McGannon 2002 NDIA presentation. It is certainly possible that Northrop Grumman could have developed a follow-on of some sort to Sea Ferret at the time of Silent Hammer. We also know that the Navy had been holding workshops and other defense industry engagement events to gauge options for submarine-launched unmanned aircraft starting in 2000, around the same time as the Submarine Payloads and Sensors initiative. A slide from a General Dynamics Electric Boat briefing at the 2006 NDIA Systems Engineer Conference, which also touches on the Flexible Payload Module (FPM) development, shows concept art for at least five different potential submarine-launched drone designs. A briefing slide from 2006 showing various submarine-launched drone concepts, as well as other potential payloads that could work with a future universal adapter., General Dynamics Electric Boat By 2002, a team that included General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, AeroVironment, and Kollmorgen, had also demonstrated a modified Universal Modular Mast that could shoot small unmanned aircraft into the sky from periscope depth. An artist’s conception of the system shows a drone design virtually identical to the Blackwing , which AeroVironment officially began developing four years later for the Navy as a submarine-launched system. USN In his guidance for 2005 , then Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark had also called for a follow-on Silent Hammer II exercise that “should employ aerial sensors (UAVs) in addition to ground sensors and exercise full range connectivity links.” It’s not clear if Clark had wanted to demonstrate a true submarine-launched drone capability or if that exercise ever ultimately occurred. Lockheed Martin’s mysterious Cormorant Of all the submarine-launched unmanned aircraft in development around the time of Silent Hammer, by far, the most interesting was Lockheed Martin’s shadowy Cormorant , a product of the company’s Skunk Works advanced design division. DARPA managed this program , also known as the Multi-Purpose Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MPUAV), which sought to develop a relatively large, stealthy, jet-powered drone that a submarine could both launch and recover. Patent documents show that Cormorant was in development at least as early as 2004. A subsequent official Lockheed Martin video presentation on the Cormorant makes clear that, while DAPRA was officially in charge of the project, it was informed, at least in part, by Navy requirements relating to the Ohio SSGNs. “The Navy came to us for our concepts for a wide range of unmanned aircraft that could operate from aircraft carriers or surface ships or even submarines,” Bob Ruszkowski, then-Lockheed Martin’s MPUAV Team Project Manager and Technical Lead, said in the video. “This idea was unique in that it was the first time someone had thought about the idea of launching and recovering the vehicle while the submarine was still submerged.” The Cormorant, in concept, would be launched from a modified missile tube on an Ohio class SSGN at a depth of up to 150 feet and then float the surface “like a cork,” according to Ruszkowski. Rocket boosters would then propel the four-ton, titanium-skinned craft into the air, a traditional turbofan jet engine would take over. During launch, as well as recovery, the intakes and exhausts for the engine would be sealed off from the water. “The aircraft uses its stealth and mission planning to penetrate hostile airspace,” Ruszkowski continued. “Once it’s in there, it can do a variety of missions, that could be collecting intelligence and reconnaissance on weapons of mass destruction sites, it could be supporting special operations forces. But whatever it’s doing, it’s using its stealth and its mission planning to avoid detection.” One patent that Lockheed Martin filed in 2004 regarding Cormorant included artwork depicting the drone releasing weapons, suggesting that Lockheed Martin, DARPA, and the Navy may have been considering a strike role from the drone, as well. A Lockheed Martin briefing from 2005 describes the unmanned aircraft as being capable of carrying a 1,000-pound payload in a modular bay, which could include sensors, communications relay systems, and even supplies that it could drop to personnel at a designated drop zone. A drawing from a patent Lockheed Martin filed in 2004 relating to Comorant, which shows how it might release weapons from an internal bay., USPTO Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin After completing its mission, it would return to a rendezvous point and deploy a parachute, landing safely in the water. The submarine would then send out its own tethered remotely operated vehicle to attach a cable to the drone and reel it back in. Another drawing from the 2004 patent showing the parachute recovery concept, as well as a “whip stall” one where the craft’s engines would shut off and it would use its wings as a large air brake at low altitude before then simply pitching nose down into the ocean., USPTO It’s unclear how far the program progressed, but we do know that Lockheed Martin conducted a number of disclosed tests, including releasing a test article from a simulated launch tube underwater, dropping that test article into the water, and evaluating the recovery concept that Ruszkowski had described in the video. Theoretically, Cormorant could have worked using a launcher mounted on a surface ship, as well. The 2004 patent shows an artist’s conception of a surface ship releasing a Cormorant off the side. USPTO Publicly, DARPA canceled development of Cormorant, ostensibly due to budget cuts , in 2008. It’s not clear whether development of the system continued on afterward, possibly in the classified realm, under a different program. Discussions about the unmanned aircraft, or its underlying concepts, virtually evaporated, even from Skunk Works, which had been promoting the project heavily up until then. A non-flying test article Lockheed Martin used during the Comorant program., USN In 2009, Lockheed Martin did file another patent relating to an unmanned aircraft that could be launched and recovered in the water. This application described a system that used an electric ducted fan both for self-propelled operation in the water, as well as in the air. The concept art curious shows an aircraft shaped like an early Cold War Soviet MiG-15 , which was reportedly because Lockheed Martin had utilized a modified radio-controlled model of one of these aircraft to test the electric fan propulsion system. USPTO The Ohio class SSGNs enter service For as open as the Navy was in the early 2000s about the book it was writing on how to employ the Ohio SSGNs, and what capabilities they might have as a result of their refits and in the future, since they actually entered service toward the end of that decade there has been relatively little information about how they have been putting that doctrine into action. Ohio was the first to rejoin the fleet, with General Dynamics Electric Boat delivering the converted submarine on Dec. 17, 2005. A ceremony to mark its return to service occurred nearly two months later. Florida and Michigan followed on Apr. 8 and Nov. 22, 2006, respectively. For unclear reasons, Michigan did not have her official return to service ceremony until June 2007. Georgia was the last to arrive on Dec. 18, 2007. The bulk of the official news reporting about these four boats has been primarily concerned with deployments, returns to home port, port visits, and general announcements about their participation in exercises. “The missions that we do are very exciting and challenging,” U.S. Navy Captain Murray Gero, then the commanding officer of the Ohio ’s Blue crew, said in one typical pre-deployment story in 2009. Ohio in 2008 after the SSGN conversion with two dry deck shelters installed on her deck., USN “We typically go to sea with over 100 tomahawk missiles, and that basically replaces a tomahawk missile inventory of three surface warships,” he continued, focusing on the time-sensitive strike mission. “This increases the flexibility of the surface fleet, because we basically allow them to reassign those three ships as soon as we get into our operating theater.” The Captain did add that the boat was capable of other missions, including intelligence gathering and special operations support, and that “they are very complex, and they involve very close coordination with several outside agencies, including SEALS.” He didn’t offer any more specific details, though. Conventional deterrence and actual combat We do know that the boats have flexed their strike muscles both for deterrent purposes and during actual operations. In 2010, Florida , Michigan , and Ohio nearly simultaneously made port visits at Diego Garcia in the India Ocean, in Busan in South Korea, and in Subic Bay in the Philippines, respectively, in what some observers took to be a show of force aimed at China. “This demonstrated that these platforms offer signaling capabilities that other conventional missile systems lack,” Forrest E. Morgan, a political scientist at the RAND Corporation think tank wrote about these events in a study in 2013. “Yet, one might doubt whether U.S. leaders would even allow SSGNs to surface while on patrol in an engagement zone during a crisis when doing so might put them at risk of attack.” In 2011, Florida also notably took part in the open stages of Operation Odyssey Dawn, the NATO-led intervention into Libya that led to the ouster and death of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. The submarine fired 93 Tomahawks over the course of the operation, 90 of which hit their targets. “By virtue of their concealment and endurance, the SSGN platform forces our adversaries to consider that they could be operating almost anywhere at any time,” then-Vice Admiral John Richardson, Commander of Naval Submarine Forces at the time, said upon Florida ’s return to its homeport at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia on Apr. 29, 2011. “The sensor suite on the boat allows the captain to gather information and intelligence in situ, passing that back to the commander and responding on the spot. When you combine all that with the tremendous combat capability the boat brings – land attack missiles, special forces, torpedoes – that’s a lot of bets the enemy has to cover down on.” Richardson subsequently became Director of Naval Nuclear Propulsion and then Chief of Naval Operations, the service’s top uniformed officer. He retired in August 2019. In 2017, Michigan had appeared again in Busan at a time of heightened tensions with North Korea, which was also seen as a signal to the regime in Pyongyang. U.S. President Trump had also revealed and highlighted the submarine’s presence in the region as a counter to North Korean aggression in a telephone conversion with his counterpart in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, which subsequently leaked out into the press. Michigan did go on to conduct exercises with the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and her associated Carrier Strike Group, which had also deployed the region. Earlier in November 2019, ABC News ‘ “Nightline” aired a segment in which David Muir got to spend a day aboard Florida , which is presently operating in the Mediterranean Sea on what was described as a “classified mission.” Muirs interviews with U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William Houston and Captain Seth Burton offered some additional insights into the SSGN operations. Houston is presently tripled-hatted as Director of Plans and Operations for U.S. Naval Forces Europe/U.S. Sixth Fleet, the Deputy Commander of Sixth Fleet, and the Commander of Submarine Group Eight. Burton is the current commander of the Florida . A view from on top of Florida ‘s sail as she sailed in the Mediterranean earlier this yar. Visible are her raised navigation radar mast, an acoustic hailing device on the left side, and a mounted Mk 48 machine gun for close-in defense., USN “We’ve put this submarine right in this area of the eastern portion of the Mediterranean to counterbalance the Russian buildup in Syria,” Houston told Muir. “We’re watching them [the Russians] very very closely. There’s really not a day where we’re not watching them, every single day.” “If you just look at the region and you’ve got ISIS in Northern Africa, you’ve got what’s going on on the Turkey Syria border right now, the fact that you’re here in the Mediterranean, does that give you a set of silent eyes for the U.S.?” Muir asked Burton. “Absolutely. It gives them eyes where no one knows that they’re being looked at,” he replied. We also know that the Ohio SSGNs regularly conduct intelligence gathering missions during their patrols and work together with SEAL teams and other special operations forces on a routine basis around the world. As Captain Murray Gero noted back in 2009, these boats offer their crews unique experiences and they are among the hottest boats to get on in the fleet. New capabilities? If operational information about the Ohio class SSGNs is limited, then details about upgrades and new technologies for these boats have been even scarcer. This stands in stark contrast to how open the Navy had been about the capabilities of these converted submarines early on and how willing it had been to discuss what it might have in store for them in the future, including the drones and UUVs, both of which have seen quantum leaps in the expansion of their capabilities over the last decade and a half. We do know that by the late 2000s, the Navy was integrating a signals intelligence collection system, called Radiant Gemstone, onto at least some Los Angeles class attack submarines, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . This came along with the necessary data links and software backend, known as Radiant Mercury, to rapidly exchange that information with the National Security Agency. A briefing slide on Radiant Gemstone from The Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at the Pennsylvania State University. Remember that ARL had been involved in the development of the Seahorse AUV and had been a member of the Forward PASS team developing advanced payload concepts for submarines., Penn State University via Phase Zero “The RADMERC [Radiant Mercury] program facilitates sharing of critical information across security domains and among allied, coalition and inter-agency partners,” an official list of the Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command’s (SPAWAR) programs as of 2017 explained. “The Radiant Mercury product provides cross-domain information sharing capabilities from Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) to General Service (GENSER) and GENSER to Unclassified.” This sounds very much like an evolution of the data sharing systems and concepts of operation that Georgia pioneered during Silent Hammer. It also seems like an ideal addition to the SSGNs that would align well with their known intelligence gathering and fusion capabilities, if they didn’t have it already, and may well be an extension of developments that first appeared on the converted Ohios . The Universal Launch and Recovery Module We also know that the Flexible Payload Module (FPM) evolved, at least in part, into the Universal Launch and Recovery Module (ULRM), also known as the Universal Launch and Retrieval Module. General Dynamics Electric Boat has described this system as primarily being intended to launch and recover various types of UUVs, including Seahorse, Seaglider , and the Bluefin 21 . The Bluefin 21 became well known world-wide after taking part in the search for the remains of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014. The U.S. Navy subsequently adopted a derivative of this UUV, the Knifefish , primarily for mine hunting missions. The modified Trident missile tubes would be able to accommodate racks that could launch and recover a number of these relatively small UUVs at once. General Dynamics Electric Boat envisioned the possibility of an SSGN deploying entire swarms of networked underwater drones to conduct persistent surveillance missions across a broad area as one possible application. There were also plans to eventually integrate larger underwater drones into the system. General Dynamics Electric Boat General Dynamics Electric Boat General Dynamics Electric Boat General Dynamics Electric Boat did not specifically say that this system could launch unmanned aircraft from submarines, but it is possible that it could have been adapted to deploy encapsulated drones. The same system might similarly be able to deploy other payloads, as well, such as mines or decoy balloons. As it was working on the ULRM, the company also said that it was developing an improved storage module that would be more readily transportable and installable. This, in principle, would have allowed more tailored special operations force packages to rapidly deploy to a forward port to rendezvous with one of the submarines for a specific mission. There was also talk about another module that could contain additional masts with sensors or potentially for deploying additional payloads, such as drones. The modular nature of these systems combined with the large number of missile tubes on the SSGNs offered the potential to readily mix and match capabilities that would be best suited to the boat’s operational needs. General Dynamics Electric Boat General Dynamics Electric Boat In 2013, the Navy said that it would test a prototype ULRM onboard one of the Ohio class SSGNs the following year. The goal at that time was to have examples available for actual operational use by 2019, but it’s unclear if this has occurred or not. Upward Falling Payloads And Hydra In 2013, DARPA itself initiated a new program to explore the possibility of launch small unmanned aircraft from capsules that could lie on the seabed, dormant and potentially unknown to potential opponents, for years at a time. A submarine could potentially deploy them covertly, as well, a mission that seems well suited to the SSGN concept of operation. Known as Upward Falling Payloads (UFP), this project envisioned a system that American forces could activate remotely, or that might be triggered automatically in some fashion, and then release its payload. “Such a system of pre-positioned, deep-sea nodes could enable a full range of maritime mission sets that are more cost-effective than existing manned or long-range unmanned naval assets,” DARPA’s archived page for the project explains. UFP is also reminiscent of the Broaching Universal Buoyant Launcher (BUBL) system from a decade earlier, but it’s not clear if there is any actual direct relationship between the two projects. Graphics showing how DARPA envisioned the Upward Falling Payloads system working., DARPA At the same time, DARPA was working on this seabed payload launcher concept, it was also exploring a modular, standardized payload module that could work with submarines, as well as aircraft and surface ships, called Hydra . This could deploy either unmanned aircraft or UUVs and sounds similar in some respects to the Stealthy Affordable Capsule System (SACS). Again, it is unclear if there was any direct relationship between these two efforts. DARPA Both UFP and Hydra appear to have come to an end sometime between 2016 and 2017. As with Cormorant, it’s not immediately clear if these continued on in some other form, including in the classified realm. In 2013, the Navy itself had successfully demonstrated the ability to launch an encapsulated unmanned aircraft via a submarine’s torpedo tube. The Los Angeles class USS Providence (SSN-719) deployed the Naval Research Laboratory’s eXperimental Fuel Cell Unmanned Aerial System, or XFC UAS, using a launch system known as Sea Robin, which used a modified Tomahawk missile launch canister. That same year, the service said it was also actively testing AeroVironment’s Blackwing using the standard three-inch countermeasures launchers on its submarines. The launch concept for the XFC UAS, showing how it would emerge from its launch canister and then deloy its wings., USN More capable than we know All told, it seems very possible, if not probable, that the capabilities of the Ohio class SSGNs have significantly expanded since Silent Hammer in 2004, even if the specifics are limited. Even without new systems, such as the Universal Launch and Recovery Module, the Ohio SSGNs have already been using their modified Trident launch tubes to deploy unmanned systems and for other novel purposes, including just acting as valuable storage space within the confines of the submarines. The intelligence collection and fusion systems that Georgia had in 2004, even before its full conversion into the SSGN configuration, were state-of-the-art. More than a decade of improvements in basic computing technology and processing power, as well as new developments in data links and communications systems , including new ways for submarines to transmit and receive information , can only have drastically expanded those already impressive capabilities. UUV and drone technology has also come a long way, both in general and within the Navy specifically. The service, by itself, has made significant progress in submarine-launched drones, drone swarm technology , and autonomous capabilities that apply to unmanned platforms in the air, at sea, and underneath the waves. Just this year, the Navy hired Boeing to build a new fleet of large displacement UUVs as part of a program called Orca, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . All of this aligns well with the SSGN’s capabilities, and the Navy’s long-standing plans to expand them, as we understand it. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo The Navy has also been quietly working on a new and revolutionary electronic warfare architecture, known as the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS, since at least 2013. The service has described this effort, which you can read about in-depth in this past War Zone feature , as involving swarms of unmanned platforms, various systems on ships and submarines, countermeasures and electronic warfare suites, and more that could combine to project signatures mimicking large groups of aircraft, surface ships, and subs. USN The Ohio SSGNs present an ideal platform for deploying elements of and supporting this cutting-edge and critical initiative. Most notably, they could launch swarms of small electronic-warfare payload-carrying drones deep in enemy territory that can project false fleets and aerial armadas on enemy sensors and act as decoys during a time of war or probe and gather intelligence on enemy air defense networks during a time of peace. Launching radar-reflector carrying balloons, a 60-year-old proven tactic, could also be part of this capability. In fact, we know of no better platform to carry out such a task. The Ohio SSGNs could also see the integration of new conventional weapons to support their time-sensitive strike mission, and otherwise expand their offensive capabilities, in the future, as well. The Navy is already working on a number of new and upgraded missiles that could have submarine-launched applications, such as the multi-purpose SM-6 Block IB , a highly classified supersonic anti-ship missile known as Sea Dragon , and the future Next Generation Strike Weapon . The Navy has also already test-fired prototype submarine-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicles from Ohio class submarines under the Conventional Prompt Strike program, though it’s unclear if it may choose to deploy those only on those submarines configured as SSBNs. Smaller weapons could dramatically increase the boats’ already impressive magazine depth. The extra capacity could give the submarines more diversity in their arsenals, allowing them to engage broader target sets, as well. European missile consortium MBDA’s SPEAR 3 mini-cruise missile and its SPEAR-EW variant, which carries an electronic warfare payload instead of a warhead, are good examples of the kind of miniaturized missiles that could be extremely valuable additions to the Ohio SSGNs. Ohio when she arrived at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility to begin her refit in 2017., USN The Navy has also been putting these converted Ohios through major refits, which serve as an opportunity to integrate even more new capabilities. Georgia left the dry dock at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in March 2019 and Ohio finished her stint at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Washington State in August. Michigan is set to return to the fleet in 2020. It is not clear when Florida , which is presently deployed in the Mediterranean, will go through the process. These overhauled SSGNs likely represent a whole new level of capability derived from lessons learned over the last decade and a half of operations. Successors to the Ohio SSGNs Unfortunately, the Ohios SSGNs won’t be able to serve forever, they are already the oldest Ohio class submarines in existence, and the Navy is already exploring concepts for what comes next. The experience with these four boats has directly informed the development of the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) for the future Block V Virginia class attack submarines. The VPM has four large multi-purpose tubes that can accept various modules just like the modified Trident missile tubes on the Ohio SSGNs, including the same seven-round Tomahawk launchers. The designs of the existing Block III and future Block IV Virginia class boats also already feature two similarly-sized Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) in the bow of the submarine. The Virginia class attack submarine USS John Warner pier-side with one of the Virginia Payload Tubes open., USN As such, the VPTs already bring some of the multi-mission capability found on the SSGNs to the Block III Virginias and this will only be more pronounced on the Block IV boats. The Navy has already set aside at least four Block II and III Virginia class submarines for special operations support missions, with two more available as alternates, if required. These six Virginias – USS Hawaii , USS Mississppi , USS New Hampshire , USS New Mexico , USS North Carolina , and USS North Dakota – can also carry the same types of Dry Deck Shelters (DDS) as the Ohio SSGNs. All of these submarines actually share a common pool of DDSs that Navy personnel can install on any of the boats, as necessary. A briefing slide from 2014 showing the available Dry Deck Shelters (DDS), at right, and the Ohio and Virginia class submarines configured to carry them., SOCOM The Navy’s present plan is to fully replace the Ohio SSGNs with Block IV Virginias by 2026, though, especially given the recent refits, its possible that the former boats could end up remaining in service longer. It’s not clear whether older Virginias would continue to serve int he special operations support role, as well. Beyond that, the Navy is already exploring options for what it presently refers to as Large Payload Submarines, which will be a future class of multi-purpose, multi-mission boats derived from the Columbia class SSBN design that will be capable of, as the name implies, deploying a wide variety of large payloads. This could include both UUVs and submarine-launched drones. The submarines could also have the ability to deploy networked swarms of these unmanned platforms above or below the waves. At present, the Navy plans to buy a minimum of five Large Payload Submarines, but it’s not clear when they might actually enter service. The current schedule would be to buy one every three years starting in 2036, after the initial Columbia class production run, totaling 12 boats, ends. However, there are already concerns about how expensive and complex the Columbias are , each of which will cost more than $7 billion, and whether General Dynamics Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding will be able to keep to the schedule . This, in turn, could push plans for the Large Payload Submarines further into the future. You can read more about all this in-depth in this past War Zone story . An artist’s rendition of the future first-in-class USS Columbia., USN More than 15 years after Georgia wrote the first few chapters in the book on Ohio class SSGN concepts of operations, the U.S. Navy’s four SSGNs remain some of the most unique and capable platforms within the Pentagon’s portfolio, and that is just based on what we know about their abilities. By every indication, these submarines have and continue to serve as testbeds for even more impressive developments that still have yet to become public. Just think, if the ability to launch various drones, both air and sea types, and especially higher-end ones like the Skunk Works’ Cormorant, was very much in development on multiple fronts 15 years ago, just imagine what is deployed today or on the drawing board. If an SSGN can carry up to 154 Tomahawk missiles, how many small weaponized drones can it carry and how could an enemy ever defend against such an overwhelming onslaught crossing their shores? It is this type of imagination and the room to realize such dreams that have made these submarines so valuable and, for lack of a better term, revolutionary. It’s safe to say that the Navy’s SSGNs are a case of “more than meets the eye,” as they are much more than the stealthy Tomahawk slingers and SEAL delivery platforms that the public perceives them to be. While their arsenal of cruise missiles and frogmen is certainly formidable, their ability to adapt, spy on the enemy, control the battle from under the waves, and above all else, accommodate new ideas, makes them uniquely ferocious to any enemy nation they may be sitting off of at any given moment.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 27, 2019",Here Is What Really Happened With That Mysterious Washington D.C. Air Defense Scare,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At around 8:30am on November 26th, what appeared to be a potential violation of the tightly controlled airspace ringing Washington D.C. occurred, sparking off a course of events that drew national attention . The White House and the Capitol went into lockdown as a Coast Guard MH-65, callsign Blackjack, scrambled to intercept the possible intruder and F-16s were sent to runway alert at Andrews AFB, prepared to rocket into the sky if needed at a moment’s notice. Confusion followed as to what exactly was detected and why. Now, according to officials with direct knowledge of the events, here is what actually occurred. Before we begin, one must understand that the Washington D.C. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) is a chunk of airspace that rings the Capital. From its center, the Special Flight Rules Area reaches out roughly 30 miles in any direction, with the Flight Restriction Zone being a bubble within the ADIZ with a radius of roughly half that distance. The ADIZ is supported by a large number of highly networked, but disparate sensors, including various radars, electro-optical and infrared cameras, and other passive sensors to closely surveil the skies in the area for potential threats. And yes, it is backed up by medium-range NASAMS surface-to-air missile systems scattered around the region, as well as Avenger short-range missile systems near key locales. Beyond that, MH-65 Dolphin helicopters at Reagan National Airport stand alert to intercept any slow-moving targets, while F-16Cs do the same at Andrews Air Force Base for faster-moving ones. Fully armed and ready to go F-16s sit engines running at Andrews AFB. The LITENING targeting pod is used for long-range air-to-air visual identification of targets. , USAF 30 miles may sound like a lot, but it is anything but. A subsonic jet traveling at cruise speed can cross that distance in less than four minutes. A single-engine light plane can do it in less than fifteen minutes. If the threat, such as a drone, pops up deep inside the airspace already, these times get cut down to nothing. The missiles are there, in part, because it may be impossible to get an F-16 or MH-65 in the air fast enough to deal with a hostile actor. So, air defenders that are tasked with this incredibly challenging mission work in seconds and single miles when it comes to reaction and decision-making times. This is a tough business with the highest stakes imaginable. On top of this, the system has been upgraded in recent years in key areas to be able to detect small radar cross-section and slow-moving targets that are out of the detection capabilities of more traditional radar systems. Once again, all these sources are networked to improve target processing fidelity, reduce the chance for horrific mistakes, and to give operators and commanders the best information possible in the least amount of time. Our sources tell us that although it is not uncommon for birds to be the cause of false alerts multiple times a month around this time a year, the issue that occurred on the 26th was a radar anomaly that was compounded by human error. One of the radars that feeds data into the integrated air defense system created what is called a “mirror track” of an innocuous and in-contact airplane whose transponder was squawking that it was under visual flight rules (VFR). Because it was a mirror track of just the transponder, there is no primary radar return where the mirror track was, the system pointed it out immediately and started automatically pointing electro-optical camera systems at it to validate the return and to identify what it actually was. Apparently, the D.C. area’s integrated air surveillance system is good enough that transponder tracks alone, where the radar doesn’t also have a corresponding hard radar return, nearly never occur. But in this case, it was an anomaly happening within the radar system, not the result of lack of radar coverage or fidelity. When the cameras pointed at the mirror track’s location, they saw a real plane that was located roughly along the same azimuth as the mirror track. The issue is that since cameras cannot quantify range, it validated that something was there, but in reality, that plane was not at the range the radar showed the mirror track to be, it was much farther away. In other words, if a plane was actually where the mirror track should have been, the cameras would have seen two airplanes, not just one. As a result of this confusion, more cameras started being pointed at the target automatically. At this time, the mirror track faded away, so the cameras had no automated radar data left to point to. Human operators took over and they started manually scanning the area for something that wasn’t there anymore. There have been reports of ‘blobs’ being seen by the air defense system operators during this instance. Our sources made it clear that this is anything but uncommon as looking into the sky with long focal length cameras results in blobs, especially when scattered clouds are present. There is simply nothing substantial or defining to look at. An Air Force air traffic controller working with his terminal., U.S. Air Force image by Senior Airman Christopher Reel The entire detection period of the mirror track only lasted a number of seconds before the radar picture returned to normal. Those directly operating the radar system knew close to immediately it was just a glitch/anomaly, but by this time, other operators were looking everywhere on camera for anything they can find, and the incident was escalating up the command and control ladder. As such, the powers that be didn’t want to discount the situation too quickly. Remember, there is literally no margin for error when it comes to countering a real threat and the nature of potential threats Washington D.C. air defenders could face has evolved dramatically recently. What could look like a flock of birds could end up being something far more nefarious in the years to come. So, once the wheels were in motion, it was really too late to stop them. This included downstream impacts like locking down high-risk targets around the Mall. But that isn’t such a bad thing as this was about making absolutely sure nothing was in the airspace that was a threat, not about having a quick trigger finger. The exact opposite actually. It’s also worth noting that the sensors and support systems that enable the air defense mission around DC are very capable, and continue to get upgraded, but like any complex system of system, some parts remain a bit behind in terms of cutting-edge technology. The system will only get better with time, and in the end, people have to interpret the information and make the best calls they can. Considering the firepower at their disposal within a dense urban area, they have done a good job over the years at making sure nobody gets hurt because of inevitable imperfections in mechanical systems and the software they run on. This should be the final takeaway, no matter how advanced a mechanical system or the larger architecture it is embedded with may be, it has the potential to be imperfect. Humans build these systems and write the code for their software and we are fallible. Above all else, aerial surveillance and air defense is far from a perfect science as we have pointed out time and time again . The average person’s perception of it being significantly otherwise is so far outside the realm of reality that it is quite frustrating at times. In the end, it comes down to the training and expertise of those who operate these systems and who would be forced to make very tough calls in very short amounts of time as a result of the data they provide. So, while the mechanical system failed momentarily in a minor way, the overall human system prevailed where it mattered most.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Seven years ago, Disney made the fantasy of a flying dragon come true and I wrote an article about how their accomplishment has big strategic and tactical takeaways. Now the House Of Mouse’s Imagineers are about to pull off a similar feat by flying X-Wings over Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge , the company’s newest land at both their Anaheim and Orlando theme park properties. It also turns out that a major aerospace firm and defense contractor may have helped make this out of this world experience a reality. So, I think it is time to revisit that post, which is far more relevant today, in a new age of perception warfare and a time where UFOs are a hot topic, and talk a bit about how Disney is getting a pair of X-Wings to actually fly above thousands of Star Wars fans. Disney is planning a huge celebration for its Rise Of The Resistance ride—the centerpiece dark ride experience at Galaxy’s Edge —which will be by far the most incredible theme park attraction ever created. It is also one that incorporates a number of new mind-bending and perception-altering effects, such as blaster bolts that virtually fire across the room like they do in the movies. Be sure to learn all about Rise Of The Resistance by clicking here and clicking here . A ton is riding on the opening of this ride as Galaxy’s Edge has reportedly underperformed a bit since its own opening. Suffice it to say, Disney is executing a huge kickoff, and this is where the X-Wings come in. Blogmickey.com has been on top of this story, posting shots of the X-Wing aircraft themselves, which are roughly 2/3rds the size of the ones used as props in the movies X-Wing. No need for going full scale if the night sky is your performance medium. Once again, Imagineers wield their forced-perspective wands to get away with far more by actually using less. The X-Wings appear to be multi-rotor drones, similar to what we see with futuristic air mobility and cargo-carrying concepts, in particular, Boeing’s Cargo Air Vehicle initiative . That may not be by chance, Boeing seems to actually have a hand in this project. Check out the video below for photos of the X-Wings and some cryptic evidence that Imagineers may have teamed with Boeing to make them a reality. As you can see, the design is pretty genius, utilizing a tubular frame with translucent skins with textures printed on them, so when they are back-lit from the inside they appear extremely vibrant and solid. The multi-rotor design gives the “X-Wings” extreme reliability and maneuverability. Boeing’s NeXt initiative -based Cargo Air Vehicle, which looks exactly like what is being used as the platform for the X-Wings, is capable of carrying 500 pounds, which should be plenty for this relatively genius design concept. Beyond the possibility that Boeing, which is also one of the world’s biggest defense contractors, is melding minds with Disney’s Imagineer team, the idea that they can make the impossible, possible, at least from the bystander’s perspective, is telling, just as the flying dragon that emerged over the Magic Kingdom the better part of a decade ago was. That was before the great drone revolution. It used a lowly manned paraglider to pull off its seemingly magical effect. Disney’s dragon in daylight. Amazing what they pulled off with so little!, Aviationintel.com The art of illusion can be just as important in warfare as direct combat. Today, as electronic warfare becomes increasingly dynamic and mixes with unmanned capabilities—make sure to read about the cutting edge of these capabilities in this past feature of ours —as well as how information can spread like wildfire via the internet, guile and misdirection will have an even greater impact on the modern battlefield than ever before. I would be remiss if I didn’t bring up the topic of UFOs, as well. Even the sharpest perceptions can be skewed when tactics are employed that are specifically designed to do so. It’s also worth remembering that Disney’s projects, and especially their flying ones, are absolutely minuscule in terms of resources compared to those of the U.S. military and its peer state competitors. With all this in mind, I want to share portions of the takeaways I wrote after Disney’s flying dragon appeared years ago as they are more relevant today than ever: Although Disney, a company more known for its animated characters and well-themed rides, not visionary aerospace design, pulling off such a lifelike flying dragon is worth a post in itself, there are some lessons to be learned here when it comes to combat aviation and geopolitics, as well (do not laugh just yet!). The ability to fly an incredibly lifelike dragon over a crowd of tens of thousands of people, and still have the average grownup amazed is an accomplishment that those in the aerospace defense world, especially many often wrong, but highly published journalists, should take note of. Once again, Disney is not an aviation company, but their Imagineering team is known to be able to do amazing things with relatively small amounts of money. They know exactly what they can get away with and what they cannot when it comes to tricking a person’s senses and perceptions. As masters of using techniques like creative lighting and forced perspective, they can literally make something mundane appear grand, and even menacing, without actually paying for what it would cost to build the subject in full. In fact, during interviews, WED designers have often said that being tied to tough budgets, often too small to conventionally achieve the objective at hand, usually ends up in a better product, both fiscally and visually. But who cares about all this in the military aviation world? Well we all should and here is why: A.) Because oftentimes what we see is not exactly as it may appear. A large part of warfare and strategy is making your potential enemies think you have something that you actually do not. Although we already know for certain that dragons are fictional creatures, the dragon displayed over the Magic Kingdom does appear real, especially under the controlled setting of the event. We only see and hear the parts of it that the designers and producers of the display intended us to consume—the detailed areas lit up by the spotlight below, its articulating appendages, and the sound effects and music track masking any prop sound from above… At the same time, lets say for hypothetical reasons a real dragon does exist and this fake was modeled upon its rumored appearance. Now that a man-made explanation has been put forth for sightings of such a beast, would a real live dragon sighting get the interest and investigation it clearly warrants? Probably not. Magic is an interesting thing because it is totally synthetic in nature and its greatest trick may be its ability to desensitize its viewers to events that are actually authentic in nature, although they may border on the unbelievable or unexpected. What I am getting at here is that disinformation and illusion can be just as effective of a deterrent as actually possessing the real McCoy itself, all at a fraction of the cost of pursuing the authentic alternative. … In the still dawning age of the internet, the ability to fortify a technological or operational ruse on a large-scale is only fortified by viral “marketing” techniques and elaborate “alternate reality games,” where false information of a detailed and mysterious nature, such as found footage and forged documents, are inserted into the global flow of digital information. At this time, the use of such cutting edge marketing techniques has mainly been the territory of Hollywood mega-blockbusters, J.J. Abrams’ “Cloverfield” being one of the most engrossing “ARG” campaigns as of yet, although there is no doubt that militaries and intelligence services worldwide are taking notice and are planning on using such subversive “marketing” to their own disinformation advantage in the future. For instance, China could “unveil” a new aircraft that does not exist in reality at all, a cutting-edge stealth long-range bomber for instance. Seeing as it is a secretive technology to begin with and its operations will be shrouded in darkness long after its public unveiling, seeing is literally believing as no other corroborating information will be available to assess its true authenticity. If such a disinformation event was also backed by a viral campaign of “leaked footage” and “secret documents,” declaring the authenticity of such a claimed machine becomes much more complex and murky. Even Disney attached a viral marketing campaign to its never-seen-before dragon, complete with “witness footage” and grainy photographs leading up to its unveiling. Simply put, the impact of something that may be of total fiction can be largely intensified by using modern viral marketing techniques. … B.) Because it shows that an incredibly creative small group of individuals can build something unprecedented, even with limited funds and a relatively minuscule knowledge base. Disney’s Dragon is obviously not a 100% solution as it most likely relies on commercially available off the shelf technology. In other words, very simple forms of propulsion and lift. But it really does not have to be any more complex than that does it? When paired with cheap supplementary atmospherics, such as sound effects and projected lighting, the impact to the viewer is greater than the sum of its parts. With all this in mind, I think that many in the aerospace industry and especially the US Department of Defense greatly underestimate their competition and potential foes’ ability to innovate and make do without the vast resources of the US Government or the know-how of legendary design houses like Lockheed’s Skunk Works. Maybe their way of addressing a certain mission or concept is not the same as ours, and their final product is not as potent, but that does not mean it is in any way irrelevant or couldn’t potentially offer greater “total force” capability if fielded in larger numbers or by being developed for much less money than its US counterpart. By doing so, precious resources could be used in other areas or not spent at all. … Some of the most innovative capabilities do not have to be realized via cutting-edge technological trends at all. By thinking outside the box, an asymmetric view of warfare can be highly effective against a technological and economically superior enemy. Just take North Korea and Iran for instance. North Korea knows it cannot compete in the technological realm with South Korea, so it has built up its low-tech capabilities to a point that they are simply daunting. Instead of developing a stealthy aircraft or cruise missile to penetrate the South’s defenses, it is rumored that the North has stockpiled a large force on cloth winged AN-2 biplanes. During the opening salvos of a total conflict with the South, these aircraft will fly low to the ground at night, packed with North Korean special forces on a one-way trip to drop them deep behind enemy lines to cause total chaos. The AN-2s flying low are hard to detect due to their largely fabric and wood structure, and they are cheap and totally expendable. [Read all about this in a post I wrote some years later linked here ] Iran also knows full well that our Navy’s ability to project power decreases with proximity, therefore they have built a large force of fast attack boats used to swarm US surface combatants in the tight spaces of the Persian Gulf, a technique the Navy is just beginning to get a grasp on countering. There are countless examples of asymmetric warfare throughout history, starting with David and Goliath, but still, as a technologically obsessed society, we must begin to come to terms with that fact that more complex and more capable is not always better, especially if such assets are only procured in small numbers. In some ways, I would love to see what the USAF’s “flying dragon” would have looked like and cost compared to Disney’s if both teams were given the same goal: Make a 40′ dragon appear real as it flies through the air at night at a few hundred feet above the ground. I predict the USAF’s dragon would have cost tens of millions of dollars and would not have been ready for Disney’s big unveiling, although it would have been needlessly powered by a jet engine, been unmanned, cruised a 25,000ft, and had the ability for the remote operator to control a swarm of other dragons although none exist and such a capability was never asked for in the original goals. In the end, I believe this old saying rings true: Beware the man with a limited budget and an unlimited imagination. As technology advances, so does the ability to create grand illusions and distribute disinformation on a massive scale on ever-smaller budgets. The Disney Imagineers have reminded us once again that we cannot trust our own eyes—seeing and believing doesn’t equate to truth. Even technology that is far less than exquisite can be paired with great creativity and successfully deceive us. In a theme park where you pay hundreds of dollars to be as deceived as much as possible, that’s an awesome thing. But in the real world, it is anything but, and in a military setting, it can mean the difference in winning or losing battles even before they ever begin.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 2, 2019",The Army Has Been Buying Alternative “Barrier Blind” Hollow-Point Ammo For Its New Pistols,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has been buying a second type of hollow-point round for its new 9mm Sig Sauer M17 and M18 pistols ,  which are also set to eventually become the standard sidearms across the rest of the U.S. military. The new cartridge is “barrier blind,” meaning that it can penetrate through certain types of obstacles, such as a window or a plywood door, first without expanding and losing much of its stopping power. It’s not clear how long the Army has been buying these rounds or if it has begun issuing them for operational use yet. The service did officially designate the cartridge as the XM1196 in March 2019, according to information from the web-based version of the U.S. government’s Federal Logistics Information System, or WebFLIS . Versions of Sig Sauer’s P320 pistol series won the Army’s Modular Handgun System (MHS) contract in January 2017 and, despite the need for some additional work on the design, the service has been steadily issuing them to operational units since December of that year. This month, Sig announced that it had delivered 100,000 M17s and M18s to the U.S. military so far. The Army’s decision to purchase the full size and compact variants of Sig Sauer’s P320, which it designated M17 and M18, respectively, also came along with the acquisition of an entirely new family of 9mm ammunition. This included the M1153 hollow-point, which Winchester designed for the service based on its T-Series . An M18 pistol, which is the compact version of the M17, with its slide fully locked to the rear., US Air Force Winchester has been tight-lipped about exactly how the M1153 differs from the other members of the T-series. It was “designed to maximize performance based on the government specification set out in the RFP [request for proposals],” Glen Weeks, Winchester Ammunition’s Director of Government Contracts and Specialty Products, told American Rifleman magazine earlier this year. Unfortunately, WebFLIS does not name the company or companies that the Army has been working with on the alternative XM1196 or offer any details about the new cartridge’s specifications, though it does list a unit price of 31 cents per round. That the service is buying them at all would indicate that it is not entirely satisfied with the barrier penetration qualities of the existing M1153. Magazines for the M17 and M18 pistols loaded with M1153 hollow-points., US Army While we don’t know the specifics about the XM1196, there are a number of commercially available 9mm rounds that are sold as having improved barrier penetration characteristics. This notably includes Hornady’s Critical Duty line, which the company specifically describes as “ barrier blind ” and that has already entered service with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Typical hollow-point bullets function by expanding into a mushroom shape as they hit their target, transferring more energy and creating larger and more devastating wound cavities. The Critical Duty design traces its roots back to the 1990s and is an evolution of concepts that involved inserting plastic plugs into the center of hollow-point bullets to give them better ballistics and penetration. Filling the gap in the center of the bullet also prevented it from getting stuffed fall of other material as it passed through barriers, such as windows or even heavily clothing, which could prevent proper expansion. Unfortunately, these plastic-tipped rounds often had had exactly the same problems, often having terminal effects more in line with standard full metal jacket or “ball” rounds. The Critical Duty design uses what Hornady calls “Flex-Tip” technology, something it has patented, which uses a more elastic compound as the filler instead of a hard plastic tip. This helps its “FlexLock” bullets retain a more uniform shape for penetrating through material such as plywood, thin sheet metal, and auto glass, and not get otherwise plugged up, but then still reliably deform when they hit their targets, creating the desired expansion. The video below shows the internal design of the Critical Duty rounds and offers some demonstrations of its penetration capabilities. The complete rounds are also designed in such a way that the lead core is better “locked” inside its metal jacket so that it doesn’t squirt out the front after passing through a hard object, also known as jacket separation. This, again, helps ensure that the entire bullet remains intact during flight and functions as intended before and after it hits the target. Testing has shown that the bullet consistently maintains at least 60 percent of its total weight after penetrating barriers. Critical duty first hit the market in 2013. The FBI subsequently put it through its famously rigorous ballistic testing and adopted it as a standard-issue round last year. No matter what the round’s particular specifications might be, if the Army adopts the XM1196 for issue on a general basis, or even a limited one, if it hasn’t already, the rounds may find their way into other guns beyond the M17 and M18. Other services and the U.S. special operations community might also already be interested in the cartridge. The details available on WebFLIS indicate that the Army has already deemed it suitable for use in existing standard-issue M9 and M11 pistols , as well as various Glocks and Sig Sauer P226s that various U.S. special operations and other specialized units use. The venerable Heckler and Koch MP5 submachine gun is another one of these associated “end items” for the new rounds, too. At the time of writing, the B&T APC9 PRO submachine gun, which the Army announced it was buying this year for VIP protection details was not on the list. A member of the US Army fires an MP5 submachine gun., US Army The Army’s acquisition of a second hollow-point round for the M17 and M18 does also raise questions again about the general legality of these cartridges in actual combat. The service has said that the existing M1153 is approved for general combat use, despite the prohibition on the use of expanding ammunition in the Hague Convention of 1899 . It is worth noting that the United States has never signed or ratified that treaty, but has typically abided by its provisions, including not issuing hollow-point ammunition for previous sidearms on a general basis in the past. That being said, the U.S. military, and special operations units especially, due use hollow-point and fragmenting ammunition in certain cases based on the position that it is appropriate to use these rounds in combat when there is a “ clear military necessity .” These types of cartridges are particularly well suited to hostage rescue and close-quarters-combat scenarios where there are concerns about over-penetration putting friendly forces or innocent bystanders at risk. Hopefully, more details will emerge about the XM1196 and its capabilities in the near future. What is clear is that the ammunition selection for the M17 and M18 pistols, as well as other 9mm weapons across the U.S. military, is still growing to include more types of specialized rounds.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 29, 2019",Mysterious Airspace Violation That Triggered D.C. Lockdowns Highlights Air Defense Challenges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Something of a mystery has emerged after a brief lockdown of the White House and U.S. Capitol due to an alleged violation of the heavily restricted airspace over Washington, D.C. this morning. Reports now indicate that a flock of birds, a weather balloon, or something else besides a plane or helicopter, appears to have triggered the alert, which sent fighter jets and helicopters scrambling into the air. Whatever the case, the incident underscores the very real challenges involved in protecting the skies above the nation’s capital, and short-range air defense , in general, especially as novel threats, such as increasingly capable small unmanned aircraft , continue to emerge and evolve. Some of the first reports of a potential aerial threat emerged just before 8:30 AM local time in Washington, with the U.S. Capitol Police and U.S. Secret Service subsequently restricting access to various sites and telling individuals at the White House and Capitol Building to shelter in place. Within 45 minutes, the U.S. Capitol Police said that the situation had passed “without incident” and the lockdowns ended shortly thereafter. Before the lockdowns ended, the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ), responsible for coordinating the defense of airspace in both countries, including over Washington, D.C., Tweeted out that “We have tasked aircraft to respond. More details to follow.” “Senior officials across the interagency are monitoring the situation on a national event conference call. NORAD aircraft are on site and responding. Plane is not considered hostile at this time,” the command said in a second Tweet that it subsequently deleted for unspecified reasons. U.S. Northern Command posted a nearly identical version of this statement on Twitter, which is still available. Pentagon spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Chris Mitchell also told CNN virtually the same thing at the time. At the time of writing, neither the Pentagon, U.S. Northern Command, nor NORAD has issued an official press release regarding the incident. “NORAD responded to an event in the Special Flight Rules Area surrounding Washington D.C. this morning. NORAD directed @USCG rotary wing aircraft to investigate and the event was resolved without incident,” NORAD said in another Tweet at 12:50 PM, local time. The U.S. Coast Guard rotary-wing asset was almost certainly that service’s MH-65 Dolphin helicopter that is based at Coast Guard Station Washington, D.C., which is collocated with the U.S. military’s Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. This helicopter also operates at times from a separate site at Reagan National Airport. The MH-65, among its missions in the area, is on call to specifically to intercept low-and-slow moving targets. Fox News also reported that unspecified fighter jets and a U.S. Capitol Police helicopter responded to the incident. It’s not immediately clear if the Capitol Police has a helicopter and this may have been the Coast Guard’s MH-65. The fighter jets in question were almost certainly the F-16C Vipers from the D.C. Air National Guard that sit on alert at Andrews Air Force Base in order to respond to just these kinds of situations. Ground-based air defense systems that also help protect the capital were also no doubt on alert during the incident. Sara Cook, a CBS News producer covering the White House, also Tweeted out a picture showing a glimpse of an AN/TWQ-1 Avenger point air defense system that is positioned on top of a building within line-of-sight of the White House. The AN/TWQ-1 is more typically seen mounted on a Humvee, but can be positioned in fixed emplacements, as well. It is armed with the two four-round launchers for the FIM-92 Stinger missile and a .50 caliber M3P machine gun. National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS , which include ground-based launchers that fire the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), are also part of this greater integrated air defense network around Washington, D.C. As for the actual target that these assets were search the sky for, at no point during the incident did any U.S. government agency identify the threat beyond the statements that it was a “plane,” which NORAD, at least, has now deleted. Sam Sweeney, a D.C. Morning and transportation reporter at ABC7 television in Washington, subsequently Tweeted out, citing unnamed sources, that a “flock of birds appearing on radar” had been the real culprit. An unnamed NORAD spokesperson told NBC News that “a flock of birds or a weather balloon” might have been responsible. However, “the comments you’re seeing about a flock of birds is speculation,” another unidentified NORAD public affairs officer told Gizmodo after those initial reports. “I cannot confirm or deny that it was a flock of birds,” they added. The employment of the MH-65 to intercept whatever it was that appeared on the radar screens indicates that the target, real or not, was seen as moving low-and-slow. This is backed up by another CNN report , citing an unnamed U.S. Capitol Police source that described the radar track as a “slow-moving blob.” That same story said that another unidentified U.S. government official said that the Federal Aviation Administration had said that air traffic controllers never saw the alleged track on their radar screens, either. Additional reporting from Fox News indicated that it might have even come to a virtual stop, “ hovering ” over a particular part of Washington, for a brief moment. Yet another unnamed source told this outlet that it might have been a “weather anomaly.” While it still remains unclear exactly what happened and why, the incident, and these sometimes conflicting reports, highlight the difficulties the U.S. government faces in protecting the nation’s capital against aerial threats, especially smaller and unmanned aircraft. This had already become notably apparent after Doug Hughes , a former postal worker turned political activist, infamously flew a gyrocopter into D.C.’s restricted airspace and landed on the Capitol Building’s lawn in 2015. He had hoped to deliver letters to every member of Congress in protest of what he said was widespread corruption and dysfunction. Hughes subsequently pled guilty to one felony charge and spent 120 days in prison, followed by a year of probation. That incident had called into question the utility of one sensor system that seemed ideally suited to detecting exactly this kind of intruder. The Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, or JLENS , a radar system on a tethered aerostat that was already long-troubled at the time. JLENS was supposed to use its elevated position to have a better chance of spotting small, low-flying threats, such as cruise missiles. A JLENS system had gone into operation at the U.S. Army’s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, some 60 miles to the northeast of Washington, on an experimental basis just a month before Hughes’ flight to the capital. The Army subsequently said that JLENS hadn’t been operating that day at all. The U.S. government did subsequently make improvements to the air defense network in and around Washington, D.C., an area referred to collectively as the National Capital Region. This included the addition of systems better suited to spotting and tracking targets with smaller radar cross-sections, such as ultralight aircraft and drones. Unfortunately, that increased sensitivity to small targets also increases the chances of false alarms, which appears increasingly likely to be what occurred in this most recent incident in the skies above the nation’s capital, whether it was a bird, a balloon, or something else. It’s possible that in the wake of the unprecedented mass suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil-related infrastructure in Saudi Arabia in September that U.S. forces in the National Capital Region are on especially high alert with regards to anything that could be a similar type of attack. Depending on the exact circumstances, a flock of birds, for instance, might look the same to radars as a swarm of drones. It would also hardly be the first time that radars have mistaken large birds for potential threats. In one particularly notable instance in the 1950s, a formation of Canadian geese triggered an alert from personnel working NORAD’s Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line radar network, who initially mistook them for a mass of Soviet bombers. When it comes to the air defense network around Washington, D.C., even if it does detect a real threat, how to respond remains complicated. Firing surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles at a target over a heavily populated area, especially at a low-flying target, raises inherent risks of causing collateral damage. Employing automatic cannons or machine guns from aircraft or emplacements on the ground still present dangers to innocent bystanders. There is also the question of whether large scale attacks, especially those involving groups or fully networked swarms of small drones, would simply overwhelm these defenses. This is major issue for the U.S. military, among others, on the battlefield, as well, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . A multitude of potential solutions, many of which would be complementary in a layered air defense network, are emerging, including various combinations of sensors, electronic warfare countermeasures , and weapon systems , including lasers and high-power microwaves . Some of these systems have already become part of the expanding defense ecosystem for countries looking to protect critical domestic sites or events that may be in or near sprawling urban areas. That’s a trend that will only continue in the future. A counter-drone system in place at Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom after reports of small drones shut down flight operations there for a period in December 2018., AP All told, whether it was a flock of geese, a weather balloon, or something else floating in the air that triggered today’s lockdowns in Washington, D.C., the incident shows the complexities of protecting the skies above the seat of the U.S. government, as well as what the United States has already done to mitigate those threats and where there might be room for even further improvement.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 31, 2020",Australia Buying B-21 Raider Stealth Bombers Is A Fantasy But Other Options Exist,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been some buzz about an Australian think tank’s idea of having the Royal Australian Air Force purchase B-21 Raider stealth bombers to provide a longer, heavier, and more survivable air combat punch. The idea is that B-21s could help check Chinese military expansion, provide deterrence, and be used to project considerable firepower far from Australian territory during a time of war. Sounds great, aside from it being highly unrealistic. There’s a report that has helped perpetuate this fantasy by drastically overselling what amounts to a non-confirmation at best from someone with no defense background. I am all into exploring hypotheticals and thinking creatively about defense challenges and procurement mixes, but at a certain point, it gets almost comical. I really don’t think I have to go into extreme detail as to why such a notion isn’t going to become a reality, but here are the highlights: Cost: The B-21 will cost about $700M per copy—that doesn’t include all the infrastructure you need to install to support it—and that is i f things go as planned, and they often do not, especially with a cutting edge “exquisite” weapon system that has to survive and persist in highly contested airspace and do so after traveling thousands of miles to its target area. Beyond that, the B-21 is a high-flying multi-role platform , it really isn’t a bomber in the traditional sense , so it is even more complex in that regard than any of its predecessors. Fiscally speaking, its saving grace is that this is Northrop Grumman’s second shot at a stealth bomber and a lot has changed technologically since the B-2’s development and subsequent budgetary death spiral nearly 30 years ago. Also, the B-21 is using a number of mature subsystems and technologies and pairing them with a cutting-edge airframe and certain advanced technologies. This lowers risk wherever possible without sacrificing greatly where it matters most. Still, even if everything works out, how many can Australia afford an effective force? Having a few doesn’t make any sense in regards to capability versus return on investment. In addition, the huge acquisition associated with buying a fleet of these aircraft is only the cover charge. It will cost massive amounts of money to keep them available for combat and training. Case in point, currently the B-2 costs $130,000 per hour to operate. Overall, sustaining the program over the decades will cost many multiples of the initial acquisition cost. The entire 2019-2020 Australian defense budget is $27.52B. Just the USAF’s budget for the same period is $165.6B. Obtaining the highest-end combat aircraft in the world on that type of budget isn’t just unrealistic, it is malpractice. Australia has a large number of absolutely critical defense procurement initiatives that would have to compete with the B-21. This includes the absolutely critical revitalization of their submarine force, one that will cost massively more, nearly double over its lifespan , than what was originally projected. Sensitivity: Considering that the U.S. would not sell Australia the F-22 due to the highly sensitive secrets it contains, how on earth is it going hand over the most exquisite combat aircraft ever realized and one that will be critical to America’s strategic deterrent? Just the risk of a third party operating it and potentially losing it or having its secrets compromised is not worth the small increase in production and sustainment scale for the program and enhanced combat power of an ally. Simply put, the aircraft was never designed to be exported and it won’t be. Balance of power: Australia acquiring B-21s would represent a huge shift in offensive capability in the region that could have substantial strategic and geopolitical impacts down the line. A pair of Aussie F-35As in formation., RAAF So no, Australia isn’t going to end up flying a squadron or two of B-21s, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other solutions that would be more attainable and logical: Buy into the program in an associate manner: By buying into the USAF’s B-21 program, it is possible that a situation could be worked out where Australia provides a number of pilots and other support personnel to existing B-21 units. In exchange, a rotational deployment to Australian shores could be set up by the USAF. This could be unpredictable in nature for a prescribed amount of days per year or even something more permanent similar to the bomber rotations to Guam . The  Pentagon and Ministry of Defense have already been working hard to expand other rotational deployments to Australia. The RAAF would benefit from the B-21 program without having to purchase aircraft, standup its own operational units, and support those units and airframes over time. Meanwhile, the USAF would retain end-to-end control of its most valuable asset. The best part about such an arrangement is that it is elastic. If both sides see a benefit in expanding it, that can happen rapidly. If either side doesn’t see the value in the arrangement, it can be terminated without the massive costs associated with shuttering an extremely high-end combat aircraft program. You don’t need a B-21 to reach far out and strike your enemy. Other options that are far less expensive exist or may exist in the near future. These include: Pay to integrate JASSM-ER onto the P-8 Poseidon and purchase more P-8s. The P-8 possesses long-range, extreme situational awareness, is mid-air refuelable, and has hardpoints for outsized stores. Based on the information available, at least four JASSM-ERs could be carried. Australia already operates JASSM and has ordered eight P-8s. By increasing this number, Australia gains multi-mission capabilities as well as long-range strike assets. Purchase large quantities of additional standoff weapons, most notably, JASSM-ER. Australia’s tactical aircraft can put them to use and potentially the P-8, if adapted to do so. Invest in more fighter aircraft and tankers. The solution is not ideal, but paired with standoff munitions, they can range out thousands of miles from Australian territory to deliver attacks on critical targets that will help break down the enemy’s anti-access bubble. Israel has long used its fighter force for long-range strikes. The RAAF, with its Super Hornets, Growlers, and F-35As, is very capable of doing the same. Procure very low observable and semi-autonomous/autonomous Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs). They have far greater combat radius than manned fighters and are more survivable. They also solve the combat search and rescue issue that would be a major problem if a manned asset were lost far from friendly territory. They can prosecute targets well over 1,000 miles from their last refueling point and do so again and again. Invest in forward basing. Working with regional allies to push air power far forward of the mainland will eliminate many distance issues in a crisis. Help robustly defend those positions alongside host nations. Buy more submarines. The most survivable asset that can persist the longest in contested territory and deliver standoff attacks are submarines. Australia’s Shortfin Barracudas are highly advanced. Invest in greater force structure beyond the dozen on order and expand their land-attack capabilities. Equip Mark 41 VLS capable naval ships with the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile or another long-range land-attack missile. Look at placing ground-launched variants at forward bases in allied countries located within range of Chinese interests. Look at cheaply adapting commercial vessels to become arsenal ships loaded with long-range cruise missiles. The RAAF has eight C-17 Globemaster IIIs . A roll-off the rear ramp variant of a long-range cruise missile could turn these aircraft, in effect, into missile trucks. Acquire surplus B-1B Lancers from the United States. This will probably be the crowd-pleaser of this post, and it sounds a bit odd, but it actually makes a ton of sense. There is a decent chance that the B-1B fleet could be sunsetted early . In fact, it could get the budgetary axe next year. If the USAF elects to wind down B-1B operations, the RAAF should attempt to acquire the cream of the fleet and the U.S. should offer it to them at the cost of nothing. You don’t need a B-21 to chuck standoff missiles far from home. The B-1B is extremely capable of this mission and others. They are not cheap to operate, but if they can be had for the cost of nothing, the operational cost could be seen as a bargain. In addition, if the U.S. retires its fleet, keeping say a dozen to 18 of them in top operational condition should be far easier than it is now . Parts would not be an issue and only the best airframes would be acquired. Paired with the RAAF’s tanker support and electronic warfare and intelligence gathering capabilities, the bone would be a near-ideal tool for waging long-range warfare in Australia’s neck of the woods. They can also be upgraded to carry future hypersonic weapons and even defend themselves from aerial attack . Another big plus is that its nuclear capability has been eliminated. Concerns with dual-use capabilities, however dubious, won’t be a factor. In the end, offloading some of the type to Australia could also help increase bomber presence where it is needed most without having the Pentagon pay for it or risking highly sensitive assets. It is a win-win. Australian F/A-18F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, a KC-30 MRTT and a B-1B on the boom. A glimpse of a potential future RAAF force structure?, RAAF So, there you have it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 18, 2018",U.S. Inspectors Have Examined Russia’s Imminently Operational Hypersonic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says that a U.S. team has had a chance to inspect one of its new silo-launched Avangard hypersonic missiles under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START . This comes as there are mounting questions about the future of that bilateral agreement, which could sunset in 2021 unless American and Russian officials agree to an extension. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the inspection had occurred in a statement on Nov. 26, 2019. American personnel had first arrived for the visit two days earlier. Previous reports said that Russia had placed the first two operational examples of Avangard in silos sometime earlier in the month and that the weapon system would reach its initial operational capability in December. “Under the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms [New START], a U.S. inspection group was shown the Avangard missile system with the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on the territory of Russia on November 24-26, 2019,” the Russian Defense Ministry statement said . Though many reports describe the event as a “demonstration” of Avangard, it is unclear if the American team observed an actual flight test of any kind. This seems unlikely given that typically tests of large, long-range missiles require notices to airmen (NOTAM) or other similar alerts to warn civilian and commercial pilots, as well as mariners depending on where the flight is taking place, to stay clear of the path of the missile. The U.S. party may simply have visited Russia to see an example of Avangard, or even just its warhead, which is an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle , and get briefed on how the Kremlin sees the weapon as fitting into the terms of New START . The treaty, which the two countries signed in 2009, puts hard limits on total numbers of how many intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBCM), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), and heavy bombers each country can have deployed at any one time. There are also limitations on how many “warheads” and deployed and non-deployed “launchers” the two countries can possess. These terms are defined somewhat confusing, with each individual reentry vehicle inside an ICBM or SLBM and every nuclear-capable heavy bombers counting as “warheads.” Bombers, along with missile silos and individual launch tubes on ballistic missile submarines, qualify as “launchers” under the agreement. There had been some question in the past about whether Russia would even agree that Avangard was covered under New START. In January 2019, the Russian government had sent a letter to members of Congress, which subsequently leaked out into the open press, that specifically stated that “weapons being developed by Russia that do not use ballistic trajectories of flight moving to a target … have nothing to do with the strategic offensive arms categories covered by the Treaty.” Avangard uses a UR-100N UTTKh ICBM as the rocket booster to loft the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle to the appropriate altitude and boost it to the required speed. Afterward, the independently maneuverable weapon then travels along a flatter, distinctly non-ballistic trajectory toward its target. This is one of the core benefits that hypersonic weapons offer over traditional ICBMs, which have more predictable flight paths and signatures after launch. This makes them harder to spot, track, and potentially engage with missile defense systems. This also gives an opponent less advance warning and, as a result, fewer opportunities to relocate critical assets or otherwise respond to an incoming strike. A standard UR-100N ICBM just barely visible in its silo., Sergey Kazak/TASS However, Russia has since clarified that they feel that Avangard, by virtue of its ICBM booster, falls firmly within the terms of New START. It is possible that the translation of the January letter was not entirely accurate, to begin with. “Considering that the Avangard system is equipped with an intercontinental ballistic missile, it will be subject to all the procedures stipulated by the strategic offensive arms reduction treaty,” Russian Lieutenant-General Viktor Poznikhir, First Deputy Head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Department, told the International Affairs Committee of Russia’s Duma, or parliament, on July 24, 2019 . “There are no big problems with Avangard [being subject to the treaty], either, because it is an optional warhead for an ICBM of the corresponding type, to which the treaty applies, too,” Vladimir Leontiev, the deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s non-proliferation and arms control department, reaffirmed during a public talk on Nov. 1, 2019. “The Avangard will enter the Treaty very smoothly.” The inspection would seem to suggest that Russia remains on schedule to declare Avangard operational next month. When this happens, the Russians will need to count deployed and non-deployed Avangards, their warheads, and the silos they occupy against the limits imposed under New START. As of September 2019, Russia had 513 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, in total, as well as 1426 deployed warheads and 757 deployed and non-deployed launchers, according to the U.S. State Department . These totals are all under the maximum allowed amounts under the treaty, meaning that Russia can put a certain number of Avangards into service without automatically having to withdraw any other systems from use. Beyond New START, Avangard becoming operational is likely to change the security calculus for various countries, including the United States and its NATO allies. The U.S. military has been warning for years about the need to develop new early warning capabilities to better spot hypersonic weapon launches and track them in flight, as well as potential countermeasures, including counter-hypersonic missile interceptors . Just this month, the European Union also initiated its own multi-national missile defense program, called Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based Theater surveillance, or TWISTER , which is focused heavily on countering hypersonic threats. An artist’s conception of interceptors developed under the TWISTER program targeting a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, in the foreground, and powered air-breathing hypersonic missile in the background., Mourad Cherfi/MBDA It is worth noting that Russia has not laid out a detailed schedule for how many Avangards it expects to deploy on UR-100N UTTKh ICBMs in the coming years. Simply based on the relatively small number of these missiles that are available, to begin with, it is very possible that the system will provide a more limited capability in the near term, even if the Kremlin does declare it has officially entered service in December. For Russia, announcing the inspection is also an opportunity to make a public show of meeting its commitments to international arms control agreements. The U.S. government pulled out of the separate Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) with Russia earlier this year, a saga that you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces , citing Russian violations, which the Kremlin continues to deny . Other arms control agreements and international deals aimed at promoting transparency in military affairs to try to avert potential conflicts, such as the Open Skies Treaty , also appear to be on shaky ground. Launch canisters and a transporter-erector-launcher that Russia says are associated with the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile, also known as the SSC-8, the weapon that killed the INF treaty., Sergei Bobylev/TASS When it comes to New START, both the U.S. and Russian governments accuse each other various violations and there has been renewed criticism of the deal recently within the United States. Russia’s January letter to Congress was primarily focused on addressing those concerns and highlighting the Kremlin’s own objections to certain American activities. You can read more about these issues in detail in this past War Zone story . American and Russian officials are negotiating whether or not to renew New START, which will otherwise expire in February 2021. The agreement includes a provision for a five-year extension if both parties agree. Beyond that, they would have to craft an entirely new deal. Criticism of the deal from the U.S. government has focused, in no small part, on whether it would cover various new Russian strategic weapons, including Avangard. Though Russia has clearly decided that this weapon system does fall under the treaty, it still sees its controversial Burevestnik nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missile, a prototype of which was at the center of a major accident earlier this year, and the Poseidon nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed long-range torpedo as exempt. In addition, U.S. critics of the agreement have pointed out that, as a bilateral deal, it only imposes limits on the United States and Russia, leaving other countries, particularly China , free to expand their nuclear and missile arsenals. There have been calls to move beyond New START and negotiate a new tripartite deal. Proponents of the existing treaty have questioned the wisdom of scrapping it before any such future deal comes into force, especially with it being uncertain, at best, if Beijing would ever agree to such restrictions. It remains to be seen how exactly Avangard’s official entry into service, which is likely to remain relatively limited in scope the near term, impacts the New START negotiations and the general security environment for Russia’s potential opponents, including the United States. Whatever the case, the Kremlin does appear to be getting very close to putting the first examples of this potentially game-changing system into service.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 7, 2019","Russia Admits Its Allegedly Treaty-Busting Cruise Missile Exists, But Denies U.S. Claims","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia, for what appears to be the first time, has publicly acknowledged the existence of the ground-launched cruise missile, known variously as the SSC-8 and 9M729 , which the United States claims violates the terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF . The Kremlin says that it has tested the weapon, but that it is fully compliant with the agreement, and in turn has accused the U.S. government of fabricating the allegation in order to gain greater technical insight into Russian missile developments. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov offered the new information during a presentation regarding Russia’s position in the INF in Moscow on Nov. 26, 2018. In October 2018 , President Donald Trump and his administration publicly announced their intention to withdraw from the agreement, citing Russia’s non-compliance as the major reason. So far, the U.S. government has not formally abrogated the deal. The United States and Russia, along with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, are all parties to the treaty, which U.S. and Soviet authorities signed in 1987 . The INF bans signatories from deploying ground-based nuclear- or conventionally-armed ballistic or cruise missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420 miles. These restrictions do not apply to air- or sea-launched weapons. After receiving the initial allegations, Russia “informed the American side that its previously specified framework for the testing activities regarding the 9M729 missile was incorrect,” Ryabkov said . “We gave the real time frame [of the tests]. We provided explanations about Washington’s erroneous ideas on the types of launchers used to carry out the tests.” Russian forces fire a ground-launched cruise missile during an exercise., Russian MOD Ryabkov said that the 9M729, which the U.S. government refers to as the SSC-8 and which NATO has nicknamed the “Screwdriver,” has a range of under 300 miles. The Deputy Foreign Minister said the Kremlin provided some technical information to show that the missile’s design would not allow for increased fuel or other relatively simple modifications that would give it an increased range. He also disclosed that Russian forces had test fired the weapon from the missile test facility at Kapustin Yar during the Zapad-2017 , or West-2017, military exercises, which occurred in the fall of 2017. Ryabkov did not say whether the country had operationally deployed the weapon, as the U.S. government has said occurred in February 2017 . The United States has previously disclosed that it had information suggesting that the missile had been in development for years beforehand. Ryabkov said that Russia was almost done crafting its response to the latest American request for information regarding the 9M729/SSC-8 when the Trump Administration announced it would leave the INF. The treaty will be among the topics Trump is likely to discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina, which starts on Nov. 30, 2018. In addition, Ryabkov confusingly referred to the missile as an upgrade of the ones associated with the Iskander-M system , which fires the 9M723 quasi-ballistic missiles. Iskander-K is a ground-launched cruise missile system that uses the same 8×8 transporter-erector-launcher (TEL), which uses the MZKT-7930 Astrolog chassis, but fires the 9M728 missile, which is compliant with the INF. However, the Russian military has referred to the two Iskander systems interchangeably and there is no indication that the 9M729/SSC-8 is a ballistic missile and the TEL can be easily reconfigured to fire either weapon. It is worth mentioning that if the United States does believe that this missile is in violation of the INF and can fit within the existing TEL, it could use that as an argument to demand that Russia withdraw all of those vehicles from service, regardless of their configuration. In addition to Iskander, the Astrolog serves as the basis for the TELs of various other ground-based missile systems, including the Bastion-P ground-launched anti-ship cruise missile. It does seem curious that the Russians would develop a new cruise missile for the Iskander that has reduced range when compared to the existing type. The 9M728 missile for the Iskander-K system uses has a publicly stated range of just shy of the INF minimum of 310 miles. An MZKT-7930 Astrolog on display with a launch canister for the 9M728 ground-launched cruise missile, at left, and an 9M723 quasi-ballistic missile, at right., Russian MOD The Russians could have enlarged the size of the warhead, but had to keep the missile’s overall size and shape within the basic dimensions required to continue using the existing TELs, which could have reduced its maximum range. The 9M729/SSC-8 is reportedly nuclear capable, while the 9M728 is conventional. It has long been assumed that the 9M729/SSC-8 is a derivative of the Kalibr sea-launched land-attack cruise missile, which itself was derived from the Soviet-era ground-based RK-55 , also known as the SSC-X-4. The Soviets officially ended development of that system after signing the INF. A Kalibr-based design would not fit within the same canister as the existing 9M728 cruise missile, but might be able to fit within the Astrolog TEL, or version thereof with minimal modifications. A low-quality image of the RK-55., DOD Of course, it is important to note that there is no independent confirmation of Ryabkov claims about the 9M729/SSC-8’s capabilities. He did not provide any imagery of the weapon in question or its TEL during his presentation. Russia may have simply chosen to publicly assign the 9M729 nomenclature to an entirely different missile from the one the United States knows as SSC-8 in order to try and conceal the development of that weapon. Since Russia has no publicly confirmed the existence of an 9M729, it has immense latitude to claim that it applies to a missile of its choosing. Some experts had speculated that by previously deciding not to acknowledge the missile at all, the Kremlin had left open the possibility of withdrawing it from service and returning to compliance with the INF in exchange for concessions from the United States without having to admit it was ever violating the treaty, to begin with. The Russians might be using similar logic in this case by now claiming it is simply a modified or upgraded Iskander-K. Russia could still be using this as cover for development and deployment of a ground-launched cruise missile based on an existing design, but with treaty-breaking range, which it could publicly reveal as a “new” system if and when the INF collapses. Ryabkov specifically threatened the development and deployment of new missiles if the U.S. government followed through with plans to withdraw from the agreement. The Deputy Foreign Minister argued that the United States had provided little concrete information to substantiate its claims and allegedly demanded that the Russians disclose the time and location of all tests of missiles in the basic category “in order for the American side to choose from them the dates of ‘dubious’ launches.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov., Vitaliy Belousov / Sputnik  via AP Ryabkov also said that one of the key pieces of evidence the United States provided to support its claims that Russia was violating the INF was satellite imagery showing an appropriately shaped TEL at Kapustin Yar. The Deputy Foreign Minister says the Kremlin countered these accusations by pointing out the multi-purpose nature of the TEL and saying that it launches various missiles from the site, but all within the parameters set by the INF. The treaty does allow for the ground-based testing of air- and sea-launched weapons that would be in violation of the deal in a ground-launched configuration. Ryabkov claimed that the United States was exploiting the mechanisms within the INF to gather intelligence on its compliant missiles. The U.S. government has never publicly provided evidence of its claims against Russia, making it hard to assess these assertions one way or another. It is easy to see how the United States might have been deliberately obscure in its discussions with the Kremlin in order to protect its intelligence sources and methods, especially if those included human sources within Russia’s military or defense industry. This could also make it difficult to declassify any of that information, which would help the U.S. government make its case publicly. Ryabkov also reiterated the Russian position that the United States is the one in violation of the INF with the establishment of the Aegis Ashore missile defense site in Romania and work on another one of these facilities in Poland . The U.S. military insists that the variant of the Mk 41 vertical launch system that Aegis Ashore uses is specific to that system and cannot fire missiles such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise missile in violation of the treaty. The Deputy Foreign Minister also cited the issue of long-range unmanned aircraft with strike capabilities , which the Kremlin has long also cited as a violation of the INF. The United States disagrees that armed drones are equivalent in treaty terms to ground-launched cruise missiles. Ryabkov suggested that Russia does not inherently disagree with that particular position, but claimed that the U.S. government had been intransigent in finding a way to formally clarify how the agreement applies to those systems. All told, as expected, the Kremlin appears to be seizing on the U.S. government’s decision to pull out of the INF without publicly presenting clear evidence of Russia’s alleged violations, as an opportunity to frame the United States as the real threat to the international “rules-based order.” This is at odds with Russia’s actual actions, including its efforts to weaken various other arms control agreements , as well as its illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region . The latter issue has once again become a hot topic following a violent skirmish between Russia and Ukraine maritime forces in the Kerch Strait separating the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It is well in line with the Kremlin’s well-established procedures for distracting and misdirecting from its own transgressions, including misinformation and disinformation about its critics. Most commonly, it involves accusations , often unfounded conspiracy theories , which paint its opponents as guilty of exactly the same crimes they accuse the Russians of committing. In this case, alleging the United States is manipulating arms control agreements to spy on Russia roughly mirrors Ameican accusations about the Kremlin’s actions in relation to the Open Skies Treaty . “There is a growing awareness in the world of the risks and threats that this ill-advised decision may entail not only for regional but also for global international security and stability in general,” Ryabkov said during his presentation. “Obviously, the main threat lies in the risk of entire regions descending into the arms race. Notably, this time this it will be a multilateral arms race at a new technological level.” With the disclosure that the 9M729/SSC-8 is real, but with a continuing lack of clear, verifiable information about its basic design and capabilities, it appears that this arms race has been going on for years already.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2020",Is This Mysterious Russian Air-To-Air Missile Tailored To Fit The Su-57’s Side Bays?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is developing a new air-to-air missile that appears to be, at least in part, derived from the medium-range R-77-series. However, it is significantly shorter than any of the variants in that family, as well as the R-74 and K-74M dogfighting missiles. This form factor seems ideally suited to meet space limitations of the small bays located under each of the wing roots of the Su-57 advanced combat aircraft . The missile, the designation of which is not known, appeared on display at Vympel NPO’s I. I. Toropov design facility in Moscow on Nov. 18, 2019. The city’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, toured the site that day as part of an event congratulating the defense contractor on the 70th anniversary of its founding. Vympel is one of Russia’s leading missile makers, specializing in air-to-air missiles, including both the R-77 and the R-74/K-74 , as well as the R-73 , from which the latter missiles are derived. “The renovated building will carry out the development and pilot production of almost all types of aviation weapons used for military purposes,” Vladimir Yefimov, Moscow’s deputy mayor, who was also present, told reporters at one point during the tour. He added there had been improvements to just over 193,000 square feet of design and production spaces within the facility. No specific mention appears to have been made of the new missile, but it is clearly distinct from Vympel’s other known products. From what we can tell, this new design has a diameter that appears close to that of standard R-77, but may be wider. It is also only about two-thirds the length. The R-77 is just under 12 feet long and nearly nine inches in diameter. It is also shorter than the R-74/K-74, which is just over nine and a half feet long. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin, holding the framed object, walks past a display of missiles at Vympel NPO’s I. I. Toropov design facility. From top to bottom, the missiles are, the new design, an R-74/K-74, and an R-77, as well as gray launch rail., Anton Novodereshkin/TASS The rear configuration of Vympel’s new missile is similar, in broad strokes, to that of the R-77, as well, with four grid-fins, but there are noticeable differences. The rear nozzle is wider, which could indicate that it has thrust vectoring capabilities. The compact weapon lacks the strakes along the rear fuselage found on the longer missile, as well. There is a pointed red cover on the nose of the missile similar to the one found on R-77s with semi-active radar homing. R-77 variants are also available with passive radar homing and infrared seekers and it is possible that versions of this new compact design may come with those guidance options, as well. Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force personnel move R-77 missiles with protective covers on their noses similar to the one seen on the new missile at Vympel NPO’s Moscow facility., PLA What appear to be small apertures for a laser proximity fuze, typically associated with a high-explosive blast-fragmentation warhead, are visible around the body toward the front of the new missile. These types of fuze and warhead arrangements mean that the missile only needs to get within a certain distance of an enemy plane before detonating its warhead, which then sends out a ring-shaped cloud of shrapnel to destroy the target. You can read more about this fuse configuration in this past piece of ours. So, by a number of indications, this new design appears to be a compact derivative of the R-77 or one that uses a significant number of R-77 components for its design. The most likely application of such a streamlined missile would be as a weapon to fit inside the wing root bays under the Su-57’s wings. These triangular-shaped fairings reportedly have clamshell-like doors that would open to fire a weapon during combat. A pre-production Su-57. The triangular, canoe-like bays are visible outboard of the aircraft’s engine intakes., Vitaly Kuzmin As The War Zone , and others, have noted in the past , these have curiously appeared too short and narrow to accommodate Russia’s existing short-range missiles, the R-73 and R-74/K-74. This had seemed to demand the design of a new, compact missile, which has now emerged. Having a missile that fits in these bays will be important for maximizing their capabilities while the Su-57 remains in its most stealthy configuration. The compact weapon could also help expand the Su-57’s overall magazine depth by allowing it to carry more missiles in its two weapons bays under the central fuselage, which also appear to be relatively space constrained. You can watch a pre-production Su-57 release a cruise missile from on its fuelsage bays at around 5:30 in the runtime of video below. The United States has also been exploring similar options to increase the total number of missiles the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter stealth fighters can carry internally for many of the same reasons. In September, defense contractor Raytheon unveiled the Peregrine , a missile derived from the company’s AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM, but half the size. In the early 2010s, Lockheed Martin has pitched a similar weapon, the Cuda . The U.S. Air Force also has an in-house effort, called the Small Advanced Capabilities Missile (SACM), exploring options for a small air-to-air missile, as well as the Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM), which is focused on developing a miniature air-launched self-defense anti-missile interceptor . As is the case with Peregrine and Cuda, Vympel’s compact missile could also offer a way for existing Russian fighter jets to increase their magazine depth , as well. Of course, the smaller missiles may have less range or other performance limitations when compared to the full-size R-77 or other larger missiles, but they would still enable Su-57s or other fighters to then carry a greater mix of weapons. If it does turn out that the new missile has the same variety of guidance options as the existing R-77s, it could also allow a single aircraft to have more options for engaging targets using different types of countermeasures or that are stealthy by design. It’s not clear how long Vympel has been working on this new missile, but the development of the Su-57 stretches all the way back to 2002. There may be new emphasis on the design within the company now that the Russian government has announced plans to buy 76 of these advanced combat jets over the next eight years. The Kremlin is still actively courting potential foreign partners to join the program and help defray at least some of the costs. Being able to present a more complete arsenal to go along with an export variant of the Su-57, or show that weapons for the aircraft that are still in development are increasingly mature, could help sweeten the deal. Whatever the case, now that Vympel has publicly shown the missile, hopefully, more details will emerge about its design and capabilities.

Tim McMillan,"Updated on Apr 14, 2020",Area 51 Veteran And CIA Electronic Warfare Pioneer Weigh In On Navy UFO Encounters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s a 70-year old mystery that, until recently, had been largely relegated to society’s rebelliously curious. Now, thanks in no small part to three Department of Defense videos showing some kind of unidentified aircraft soaring through restricted airspace, the topic of UFOs has suddenly reemerged as a subject worthy of mainstream attention. First hitting the public almost two years ago after originally being filmed by the targeting pods of Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters in 2004 and 2014-2015 , interest in these clips has only been bolstered by a recent official statement from the Navy saying, indeed, these blurry objects are “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena” or “UAP.” In other words, their type and origin remain unknown, at least officially. Despite all the attention from the media and the general public, for a man who’s worked on some of the most highly-classified aerospace programs in the world, all this new UFO talk isn’t all that impressive. In fact, for T.D Barnes, a former Special Projects engineer at Area 51, this entire UFO story sounds very familiar. T.D. Barnes’ journey into the world of black projects began in 1954, when the young Army radar systems officer was selected to work with the world’s first operational surface-to-air missile systems (SAM), the Nike Ajax and Nike Hercules . Later, through defense contractor Unitech, Barnes would work out of NASA’s enigmatic High-Range Tracking Station-Beatty, assisting with secret space programs, such as NASA and the Atomic Energy Commission’s (AEC) joint attempt at developing a nuclear rocket engine for manned flight to Mars, a project codenamed NERVA. Finally, by the early 1960s, Barnes would be whisked away by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to work on “Project OXCART,” the development of the A-12 spy plane, at the ultra-reclusive and then quite new Area 51 . Former Area 51 Special Projects Engineer T.D. Barnes standing in front of a Lockheed A-12, one of many programs Barnes worked on at Area 51., Tdbarnes.com When the focus shifted to the A-12’s successor, the SR-71 Blackbird, Barnes would end up at Area 51’s Special Projects section, part of the Air Force’s Foreign Technology Division (FTD). Until Barnes’ retirement in the late 1970s, for almost two decades, he would work deep inside a world of government secrecy that most will never even get a glimpse of. When it comes to recent accounts of Navy UFOs, with decades working on the world’s most advanced aerospace projects, T.D. Barnes has a theory: “This takes me back to circa the 1960s when the CIA designed and was building the Mach 3 A-12 Blackbird to replace the U-2 ,” says Barnes. At the time, the CIA was gravely concerned that the Soviet Union’s new P-14 “Tall King” radar system would be able to detect the A-12 flying over their airspace. To combat these concerns, the CIA launched an audacious program to develop technology that could electronically generate and interject false targets into the Soviet radars, to trick them “seeing” and tracking non-existent “ghost aircraft.” The project’s codename was PALLADIUM. An A-12 Oxcart. , USAF The War Zone was first to establish a potential historical relationship between PALLADIUM and the Navy’s UFO sightings last Spring. The history of the project is as such: In 1960, when the Soviet Union moved a Tall King radar system to Cuba, the CIA began covertly using PALLADIUM to trick Russian air-defense radars into thinking unidentified aircraft were flying towards and even into Cuban airspace. As one of the few members of the PALLADIUM team, Barnes served as the air-defense artillery (ADA) and electronic/electromagnetic countermeasures (ECM/ECCM) officer for the classified program. “Using an electronics-laden C-97 [EC-97G], we could make Soviet radars believe they were tracking any number of aerial objects,” mused Barnes. “At one point, a Russian MiG-15 pilot even claimed he could see the target and had a lock on it.” Ultimately, PALLADIUM gave the United States forewarning that Russia’s radar capabilities were advanced enough they would soon be able to track and shoot down the Blackbird surveillance planes. As a result, no official crewed surveillance flights were ever conducted over Russia with the jet. When it comes to the more recent Navy UFO encounters, Barnes says, “I don’t have the answers to what the Navy aviators saw, but in my mind, I’m thinking, we are doing it again.” Barnes’s comments are remarkable given The War Zone’s recent exclusive on the Navy’s latest revolution in electronic warfare, the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS. Similar to the 1960s Project Palladium at its most basic level, but almost unimaginably superior in scale and capabilities, NEMESIS gives the Navy the ability to simultaneously fool a vast array of enemy sensors spread out over a large area, giving the illusion of ghost fleets of vessels on and below the surface of the ocean and formations of aircraft in the sky. The shadowy system achieves this via networking a vast array of disparate electronic warfare platforms and decoys together, including various swarms of unmanned aircraft and vessels, to create high-fidelity and unified electronic warfare effects across a battlefield. S. Eugene Poteat at CIA Headquarters, The Institute for World Politics When it comes to potential PALLADIUM-like connections with recent UFO events, there’s likely no one more capable of providing answers than the arguable father of electronic intelligence warfare, retired CIA executive officer, S. Eugene “Gene” Poteat. Described as one of the “Wizards of Langley,” Poteat is the man who founded and for 15-years ran PALLADIUM while working at the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology office. Now in his late 80s, in a rare interview, Poteat said he wasn’t familiar with the recent Navy UFO encounters, yet admitted the events sounded “interesting.” Ultimately, Poteat said he would need to see more of the Navy’s data in order to give his opinion. A source of contention amongst aviation and UFO enthusiasts, beyond Navy eye-witness accounts and the three brief ATFLIR targeting pod videos released by former Blink-182 frontman Tom Delonge’s UFO-related company To The Stars Academy , no other data on the alleged UFO encounters has been made public. Poteat was, however, able to offer some little-known details about PALLADIUM that potentially hold significance to recent UFO reports. “To determine Russia’s ability to detect small targets, we used submarine-launched balloon-based metallic spheres,” said Poteat. “The idea was for the early warning radar to track our electronic aircraft. Then for our submarine to surface and release the calibrated spheres up and into the path of the oncoming false aircraft.” Though descriptions of “balloon-based metallic spheres” sound somewhat similar to eyewitness accounts of UFOs, Poteat explained that the different size spheres were used to detect Russia’s radar cross-section detection capabilities and not to try and fool the Soviet Union into thinking they were seeing a flying saucer. This fact was previously discovered by The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway who also found a balloon-borne radar reflector patent that fits the description of exactly what some Super Hornet pilots saw off the East Coast in 2015, described as bizarre floating “orbs with cubes inside.” Check out his full report here . Similar to what Rogoway surmised, Poteat’s description of sub-launched radar balloons potentially supports a prosaic explanation for at least some of these strange encounters. 1955 Image of CIA Sub Launched Surveillance Balloon. , CIA Library Undeniably, there are some conspicuous similarities between when the USS Nimitz (in 2004) and USS Roosevelt (in 2014-2015) carrier strike groups began to encounter strange unknown aerial objects. Namely, these encounters occurred only after the groups had begun using a host of brand-new and highly sophisticated technologies, both of which The War Zone was first to point out . In both instances, 2004 and 2014-2015, the carrier groups underway were equipped with revolutionary new systems that would give them huge leaps in networked air defense capabilities. In the first instance, the Navy’s groundbreaking Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) was preparing for its first deployment ever. In the second, a far more capable evolution of CEC was about to head on deployment, along with the new and massively capable E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, which is networked into the CEC ecosystem. The War Zone’s in-depth coverage of this cutting-edge integrated air defense system and how it fits into the larger story about the Navy pilot encounters can be found here. Also by 2015, many Super Hornets had gained new the significantly upgraded Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar systems. This seems to have drastically helped with detecting the hard to track objects in question. Again, you can find The War Zone’s extensive coverage on this aspect here . T.D. Barnes believes the deployment of these new technologies to be key and thinks it’s likely the Navy’s “UFO encounters” involved simultaneously testing of ship’s air defense capabilities and the ability of new technologies to defeat them. “Testing and evaluating advanced technology, both domestic and our adversaries was much of what we did while I was with Special Projects at Area 51,” said Barnes. Some argue, had the Navy’s UFO encounters been related to classified testing, military personnel would have been briefed and made aware they were part of a training mission. Still bound by security oaths, T.D. Barnes was limited in what he was willing to say, however, the Area 51 veteran didn’t out-right dispute the idea sailors would have been in on operational plans had these been training events. “When we were testing the MiG-21 against our planes, we’d often use National Guard pilots, who were only told that they were on a classified mission against foreign-made technology on Nellis Gunnery Range. They knew nothing about it being a CIA, DIA, Navy, and Air Force Foreign Technology Division project out of Area 51,” said Barnes. Even with eyewitness accounts, and the Navy’s recent statements that these objects are truly “unidentified,” T.D. Barnes still feels fairly certain someone in Pentagon knows exactly what the Nimitz and Roosevelt Carrier Groups were dealing with. In Barnes’ opinion, the edited and shortened ATFLIR videos and pilot’s demeanor suggests aviators were at least vaguely aware of what they were targeting. “The videos ‘I’ve seen, the pilots were whooping it up. I think they knew,” said Barnes, referring to the “Go Fast” and “Gimbal” videos. With the pilots who have spoken about the incidents, all deny having any knowledge of what were the mysterious objects they encountered. Screenshot of the DoD “Nimitz UFO” video., Public Domain For the Navy to point at video evidence and say, that’s “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena” represents a rare move by a branch of the American military. For a lot of people, this declaration seems to slam the door on any debate of whether or not the objects in question are highly exotic and classified aerospace technology. However, referring back to The War Zone’s in-depth coverage on Special Access Programs (SAPs), if these aircraft were related to an unacknowledged SAP or waived-unacknowledged SAP, the existence of this technology would be denied to everyone outside of the program. Moreover, if these were highly classified technologies emerging from a SAP being run by another branch of the Department of Defense, the Navy could indeed be unaware of what these objects really are. Barnes told me he’s aware of many past UFO sightings in the Seattle and Southern California regions that were actually advanced aerospace tests by Boeing or Lockheed Martin’s Skunkworks. According to Barnes these “proof of concept” flights frequently occur prior to a company bringing the platform to Area 51 in hopes of selling it to the Air Force, Navy, or other branches of government. “These were definitely UFOs because they were so secret that they didn’t exist,” said Barnes. When asked, both T.D. Barnes and Gene Poteat declined to comment on whether they were aware of any oblong shape, hypersonic capable, aerospace platforms in existence. When it comes to the subject of UFOs in general, T.D. Barnes offered me these parting words: “On NASA High Range and Area 51, I spent thousands of hours tracking aircraft. Though I tracked many that I could not identify, I never suspected them of being extraterrestrial. On these same projects, I worked with many test and operational pilots. I have never heard of one suspecting that they may have spotted a UFO. I believe a true extraterrestrial sighting would excite the world to the point that there would be millions of people leaving the city lights to stare at the heavens hoping to see whatever it is. That would be all the media would talk about. That said, I would like to think that we’re not the only rock in the universe with life.” Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com Tim McMillan Contributor Electronic Warfare/Countermeasures History Navies News & Features People Sea U.S. Navy UAP"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but two U.S. Air Force T-38 Talon jet trainers were involved in a mishap at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma today. The service has said that four pilots were involved in the accident and that two have died, but the condition of the other two individuals is unclear. The mishap occurred at around 9:10 AM during what the Air Force has described as a routine training exercise. So far, there are no specifics about exactly what happened, but live feeds from local news outlets show that both jets departed a runway at Vance and that one of them flipped over entirely during the accident. We don’t know what units the aircraft were assigned to, but the base is home to the 71st Flying Training Wing, which includes multiple squadrons that fly the T-38, as well as other aircraft. “At the time of the accident, the aircraft were performing a routine training mission. There were two people onboard each aircraft,” an initial press release from Vance’s public affairs office read. “Vance emergency response personnel are on scene to treat casualties and assist in recovery efforts.” “Two Vance Air Force Base Airmen were killed in an aircraft mishap at approximately 9:10 a.m. today. At the time of the accident, the aircraft were performing a training mission,” a second release stated . “Vance emergency response personnel are on scene to treat casualties and assist in recovery efforts. Names of the deceased will be withheld pending next of kin notification. A safety investigation team will investigate the incident.” The T-38 community suffered a significant number of accidents between 2017 and 2018, with six major mishaps in the space of 12 months . This included another mishap involving a jet from the 71st Flying Training Wing in August 2018. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 8:45pm EST— The Air Force has now said that the incident occured during the landing phase of a training exercise and that the pilots in the other aircraft were unhurt, according to Air Force Times . Details about exactly what happened remain limited. “Only … for the purity of the safety investigation,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Corey Simmons, commander of the 71st Flying Training Wing, said at a press conference. “I don’t want to try to guess. I wasn’t out there when it happened.” “I know that there are two airplanes that are off the runway right now at Vance Air Force Base,” he continued. “How they got to that point, I’ve got to let the investigation play itself out.” Simmons added that the mishap had led officials at Vance to shut down flying operations for the day and that this would likely continue into Nov. 21, 2019.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The military working dog named Conan, who became famous for taking part in the dramatic raid on a remote compound in Syria that led to the death of infamous ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has received a medal and a plaque in a photo-op at the White House. Conan was injured in the operation, but has recovered and remains on active duty. You can read all about the raid, which occured nearly a month ago now, and Conan’s part in it, in the War Zone ‘s past reporting here and here . The dog’s regular handler did not accompany him to the ceremony at the White House due to operational security concerns, since that individual is also still on active duty. “Conan came over from the Middle East – just arrived with some of the great people from the special forces that did the – it was a flawless attack,” President Donald Trump told members of the press . “And al-Baghdadi is gone. That was a flawless attack and I just met quite a few of them. And we just gave Conan a medal and a plaque.” “I actually think Conan knew exactly what was going on,” he added. “The dog is incredible… We spent some good time with it. And so brilliant – so smart.” Trump also warned reporters that Conan was trained to attack if you opened your mouth and to be careful around him. By all actual indications, Conan is, not surprisingly, very well trained and appeared docile and friendly at the event, not requiring a muzzle as often seen on military working dogs at public events. “In spite of being with a new handler, Conan was very calm and composed,” a member of the White House press corp wrote in a pool report. “In your pooler’s humble opinion, he was a very good boy. A very good boy indeed.” There continues to be some confusion around the dog’s sex, with the press pool later changing their statement to indicate the dog is actually female based on statements from White House staff. “Your pooler retracts the earlier comment that Conan was a very good boy. Conan is apparently a very good girl. Good girl Conan.” However, in a press conference on Oct. 30, 2019, regarding the raid on al-Baghdadi’s compound, U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), had specifically said that the dog was male. He had also said that the dog, whatever its sex, was a four year veteran of the U.S. Special Operations Command K-9 program and has already taken part in approximately 50 operations. Following the appearance at the White House, the dog will go right back to being available to take part in future American special operations missions. Today, though, Conan can bask in the limelight, representing the invaluable contribution of military working dogs to U.S. special operations, as well as conventional missions , around the world. It’s a continuation of an already long and impressive history of dogs taking part in American military activities. Conan has also had the opportunity to be the public face of the raid, since the humans who participated, such as his handler, can’t appear in public yet to receive their own accolades. If you’re interested in support the military working dog community yourself, you can make a donation to one of the many foundations, including the Warrior Dog Foundation or Mission K9 , that are working to ensure that these four-legged veterans live a healthy and fulfilling life after they leave their respective services. First Lady Melania Trump told reporters that she was not interested in adopting Conan as a pet for her son Baron, but the dog will hopefully find a good home in the future as at least some small recognition of its service to the country. UPDATE: 4:00pm EST— The White House has now issued a correction that Conan is, as General McKenzie had previously said, male.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 6, 2019",Turkey Tests F-16s And F-4s Against S-400 Radars In Defiance Of U.S. Sanctions Threats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkey has begun tests of the radars associated with its new Russian S-400s using American-made F-16 Viper and F-4 Phantom II fighters, defying warnings from the United States that this “activation” of the surface-to-air missile systems could prompt new sanctions . U.S. officials had been concerned that the Turkish military might conduct exactly these sorts of tests with the F-35 , potentially giving Russia insights into the jets’ capabilities, an issue that remains at the center of the spat over Ankara’s deal with Moscow to buy the air defense system in the first place. The Pentagon already ejected Turkey from the Joint Strike Fighter program earlier this year and is finalizing efforts to remove Turkish defense contractors from the supply chain, as well. Turkey’s Ankara Governorate announced the tests on Nov. 24, 2019. The S-400s are presently based at Murted Air Base, which is situated just outside the Turkish capital. The testing, which began today, is scheduled to continue through Nov. 26. Russia began delivering components of the air defense systems in July. Reports have indicated that the Turkish S-400s may be fully operational by April 2020. “Within the scope of some projects carried out in coordination with the Presidency of Defense Industries, F-16 aircraft and other aircraft belonging to the [Turkish] Air Force will carry out low and high altitude test flights on Monday and Tuesday in the skies of Ankara,” an official statement from Governorate said. There are no details yet on the exact test objectives. However, video footage of the tests so far show F-16s and F-4s flying over Murted and examples of the 91N6E surveillance and acquisition radar and the 96L6E air search and acquisition radar, the latter elevated on an 40V6M mast, clearly in operation below. The mast-mounted version of the 96L6E is also designed to be better able to detect low-flying targets that a radar positioned right on the ground might not be able to detect through the surface clutter. These initial tests may just be to ensure that the radars are working properly or to see if they can adequately distinguish Turkish aircraft as friendlies. U.S. military officials, as well as those from other NATO members, have previously warned that the S-400 does not meet the alliance’s interoperability requirements and therefore would not be able to be integrated with other allied air defense networks during an actual crisis. This, in turn, creates the risk that the Russian surface-to-air missile system might not be able to properly tell friendly and hostile aircraft apart when it matters most. A diagram showing various typical S-400 battalion components, including the 91N6E and 96L6E radars, as well as the 40V6M mast system., RIA Novosti Whether or not these tests, or additional evaluations in the future, are collecting data on how jets, such a the F-16, appear on the S-400’s radars is unclear. The 92N6E fire control radar is notably absent from the pictures and video of the tests, as well. The United States had feared that the air defense system could gather details about the F-35’s stealth signature, or other information about that aircraft’s capabilities, which Russian technicians assisting Turkey could then have potentially relayed back to the Kremlin. The U.S. government’s position has been and remains that Turkey can have either the S-400 or the F-35, but not both . A Turkish Air Force Block 50 F-16C Viper. At least one of these aircraft took part in the tests of the S-400 radars., Turkish Ministry of Defense Whatever the case, the testing of the S-400 radars, and doing so with American-made aircraft, sends a defiant message to the United States and makes clear that Turkey, and its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has no intention of giving up the air defense system, at least any time soon. It also dares U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration, as well as Congress, to act in regards to sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAASTA . Unless Turkey were to get a waiver, this law requires the U.S. government to take significant action against its Turkish counterparts over the purchase of the Russian-made system. However, the White House and members of Congress have deferred on this repeatedly, suggesting they would only act if Turkey “ activated ” the S-400’s radars. This was clearly meant to provide room for Ankara to reverse course and abandon the purchase, keeping open a potential path for the country to rejoin the F-35 program. “Turkey’s acquisition of sophisticated Russian military equipment, such as the S-400, creates some very serious challenges for us, and we are talking about it constantly,” Trump had said alongside Erdogan during the latter’s visit to Washington, D.C. earlier in November. “We talked about it today. We’re talking about it in the future. Hopefully, we’ll be able to resolve that situation.” U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands during a press conference in Washington, D.C. on Nov. 13, 2019., Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Sipa USA via AP Images Now that Turkey has “activated” the radars, members of Congress may increasingly call for Trump to act in accordance with CAASTA or take additional steps themselves. There has already been something of a backlash to the Turkish government among American legislators following Turkey’s launching an intervention into northern Syria aimed primarily at Kurdish groups, including U.S.-backed forces, in October 2019. Turkish-backed Syrian forces stand accused of numerous atrocities since then. Ankara subsequently cut a deal with Moscow to create a buffer zone along the Syrian-Turkish border, as well. Around the time of Erdogan’s visit, Congress had also looked set to pass a resolution acknowledging the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Empire, a move that deeply angered Turkey. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and prominent supporter of Trump, blocked it, reportedly at the direction of the president. The Trump Administration is clearly concerned that criticism of Turkey’s human rights record in Syria and hitting Ankara with CAASTA sanctions, among other things, could scuttle attempts to negotiate a solution to the S-400 issue, as well as a new bilateral trade deal . At the same time, it’s unclear if these moves will actually sway the increasingly dictatorial Erdogan to shift his positions on any issues. When it comes to the S-400s and CAASTA, Turkey is now reportedly in talks with Russia about buying some number of Su-35 Flanker-E fighter jets, another move that could prompt sanctions and further inflame tensions with the United States, as well as the rest of NATO. Erdogan has already said that his country plans to cut deals with the Russians about manufacturing components of the new S-500 air defense system and the Kremlin has also repeatedly offered to sell Su-57 advanced combat jets to the Turkish Air Force as alternatives to the F-35. By most indications, Ergodan continues to move closer and closer into Russia’s sphere of influence. The S-400 tests only further underscore this reality, despite recent reports that Turkey has been upset with Russia over its implementation of their agreement regarding patrolling the Syrian border. With the new tests of the S-400 radars, Turkey seems well past the point of no return with regards to the F-35 program, at least for the foreseeable future. It’s a decision that only increases the likelihood of the U.S. government imposing serious sanctions on Turkey, which could prompt a further chill in relations between Washington and Ankara, in general, in the near term.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019",The First Boom-Equipped Tanker For A Private Aerial Refueling Company Has Arrived,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the commercial adversary air support market is ballooning , the commercial aerial refueling market continues to expand at a remarkably slow pace. That may be about to change as the pioneering company Omega Air has just received a surplus KDC-10 tanker from the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The company already flies a couple 707 tankers and another KDC-10 , but none of them are equipped with an aerial refueling boom that the USAF and many of its allies rely on. Instead, they exclusively have the hose and drogue arrangement used by the Navy and Marine Corps. This new aircraft puts Omega Air in the position to blaze a trail when it comes to finally bringing contractor refueling support to the USAF and other allies. Omega Air stated the following in a press release: The new aircraft, T-264, to be registered as N264DE going forward, was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, modified into a boom-equipped aerial refueling tanker and began to serve as part of the RNLAF fleet in 1995. It is already certified to refuel receptacle aircraft such as the A-10, B-1B, B-52H, C-17, E-3, E-8C, F-15C/D/E, F-16A-D, F-16F, F-16I, F-35A, KC-10, KC-135R/T, RC-135 V, RC-135 S, RC-135 U, and MC-130. Omega entered into an agreement to purchase two of the RNLAF KDC-10 aircraft this fall. The second of the two purchased KDC-10 tankers will arrive separately, and will be added to the Omega fleet shortly after delivery. The addition of these KDC-10 tankers, along with their boom capability, will give Omega the capability to potentially refuel every operative type of aircraft in U.S. military inventory. Sebastian Barheier/wikicommons While the Navy and Marines have been using Omega Air for contractor tanking support for nearly two decades, the Air Force is still figuring out exactly how it wants to approach what could be a major seachange for the service—one that has hundreds of tankers in its fleet. A substantial contract tender for commercial tanking support has been forthcoming from USAF for some time now , but as of today, it is still being defined. Yet nobody actually has an aircraft that can do the job today. Now that Omega has such a capability, maybe some risk reduction work can be done cooperatively that will allow the Air Force to focus their requirements and become a bit more open to the concept overall. Part of the draft requirements the Air Force has put together for a still to be released tanker contract tender. This part shows the basic aircraft requirements., USAF USAF I have written extensively over the years about how the Air Force could shift a substantial amount of its non-combat aerial refueling burden over to contractors, freeing up funds to buy new tankers with enhanced capabilities for its own fleet and investing other dollars elsewhere. Some big cultural and budgetary obstacles to getting this done exist, but another issue is that there just aren’t a ton of surplus boom-equipped tankers available on the second-hand market, with only 14 KC-135Rs currently being stored at the Defense Department’s AMARG boneyard in Arizona and their material state and general availability is unknown. Still, this too will slowly change in the coming years as old tankers in frontline service begin to step aside for new ones. For instance, Singapore just retired its KC-135R fleet , and other operators, like France , will follow suit, eventually. Beyond that, as the KC-46 finally comes online, USAF KC-135R tankers —nearly 400 are currently in service—will leave the force, some of which have remarkably low hours for their age. Omega Air is extremely capable of keeping older airframes flying reliably and has done so even with airframes with much older engines than those found on the KC-135R. KC-135Rs serve as the backbone of the USAF’s tanker force, but they are six decades old. , USAF In addition, the KC-10 Extender was slated to begin to be slowly phased out beginning this year, but those plans have been put aside, mainly due to ongoing issues with Boeing’s KC-46 Pegasus . Still, quickly eliminating the entire fleet as part of a budget realignment has been a possibility before, and it could be again as soon as next year. The KC-10 force represents a fleet of 58 airframes that could go a long way in fulfilling private air contractors’ potential future needs. I would also allow them to handle long-range “tanker drags” and cargo-hauling missions better than surplus KC-135Rs. The KC-10s are also already equipped with both an internal hose and drogue system in addition to a boom system and they can be refueled themselves inflight, something only a tiny handful of KC-135s are capable of. You can read all about that here . Interestingly enough, the price to operate each aircraft isn’t that different. Military.com wrote the following in 2018: It costs roughly the same to fly the KC-10 and the KC-135: $19,612 per flight hour for the KC-10, and $21,161 per hour for the KC-135, according to the Air Force’s 2016 operational cost datasheet. KC-10A Extender., USAF The KC-10s, which were largely acquired in the 1980s, are also far newer aircraft than the KC-135s, which were built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. DC-10s still fly around the globe for cargo carriers, while the KC-135s are niche military airframes and their 707s cousins have all but disappeared from the air entirely. Meanwhile, Israel’s IAI has a 767 tanker conversion that is far cheaper than purchasing a new aircraft and Airbus and Lockheed have joined forces with the eye on disrupting the U.S. tanker marketplace with Airbus’s KC-30 Multi-Role Tanker Transport that is based on the A330. As KC-46 delays continue to mount , the far more elastic contractor option, which could include new-build KC-30s flown by contractors, will increasingly look more attractive. Once Omega Air gets its fleet of two boom-equipped KDC-10s spun-up, it will be interesting to see the impact they make on the still budding industry and the USAF’s perceptions of it. If they can deliver a reliable and safe product for less than what the Air Force currently pays, and all without having to actually own and maintain fleets of aircraft directly, and everything else that goes along with it, the arrival of Omega’s KDC-10 could mark a historic turning point in the Air Force’s 60 year history of jet age aerial refueling.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 28, 2021",The AGM-86C Cruise Missile That Introduced GPS Guided Weaponry Is Bowing Out Of Service,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A staple of the Air Force’s long-range strike portfolio has come to the end of the road. The AGM-86C/D Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), the non-nuclear sibling of the AGB-86B that remains in service as the backbone of the B-52’s nuclear strike mission, is being put rest after decades of service. The last download of these missiles from a B-52H occurred at Barksdale AFB on November 20th, 2019, marking the final end to the weapon’s service. CALCM was born out of the nuclear-armed ALCM program from the 1970s that eventually produced the AGM-86B. The potential for the missile to carry a much heavier payload than a nuclear warhead in trade for less range was seen early on. By the mid-1980s, the CALCM program was borne. It was the first munition of any type to use GPS guidance and saw its combat debut as part of the opening strikes of Operation Desert Storm. This mission was, at the time, a highly secretive operation aptly dubbed “Secret Squirrel” and was seen as something of a game-changer when comes to the evolution of modern weaponry. You can read all about it here . CALCM on target during a test firing., DoD CALCM, which uses GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain matching for guidance, has received various upgrades over the years, but it’s three decades old and based on a missile design that is over a decade older than that. This means that supporting has become increasingly troublesome and costly. CALCM’s lack of high-end stealth capability and other modern navigational features means that it has become more vulnerable, as well. DoD These factors paired with the introduction of the AGM-158 Joint Air-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), point to the reality that the CALCM is due for replacement.  JASSM has a plethora of new features including very low-observability (stealth) and passive infrared target-matching/homing, makes it a far more survivable and accurate missile on a modern battlefield that can include heavy doses of electronic warfare, including GPS and radar jamming. JASSMs loaded into the bomb bay of a B-1B prior to strikes on Syria on April 13th, 2018., Undisclosed JASSM cannot carry the size of payload that CALCM could. The AGM-86C model carries a 1,500 or 3,000 lb blast fragmentation warhead, while the D carries a multi-warhead penetrator for attacking hardened targets. JASSM carries a dual-mode blast-fragmentation/penetrator warhead in the 1,000lb class. Still, modern warhead design has allowed for similar effects in lighter and smaller packages, which could offset some of this warhead weight gap. While JASSM has a range of almost 250 miles, its extended range cousin, JASSM-ER can reach out nearly 600 miles, which is fairly close to the range of CALCM. Another variant of JASSM, the JASSM-XR , that is under development, will be substantially larger than the JASSM-ER and will offer a range of over 1,000 miles while carrying a larger 2,000lb warhead. JASSM-XR is slated for operational service around 2023.

Yet even those will be fully mitigated and then some by the upcoming JASSM-XR. Beyond JASSM, the Long-Range Stand-Off (LRSO) missile is currently in development to replace the AGM-86B ALCM in the standoff nuclear-armed cruise missile role. LRSO will also have a conventional variant that will incorporate the latest navigation, low-observable (stealthy), and warhead technologies. AGM-86 during a test flight., USAF This missile, which is a key component of the initiative to upgrade America’s geriatric nuclear arsenal, is planned to be operational around 2030, leaving the AGM-86B ALCM to soldier on another decade via a life-extension program. ALCM has a range of 1,500 miles, it is likely the LRSO will have equal if not considerably enhanced standoff capability. It will be interesting to see what type of payload the conventional version will be able to carry and over what distance, and as a result, how it will significantly outperform the JASSM-XR. You can read all about the LRSO in this past War Zone article. Retired Cols. Trey Morriss (left) and Warren Ward (right), members of Operation Secret Squirrel, stand in front of the final Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) package at Barksdale Air Force Base, La., Nov. 20, 2019. Operation Secret Squirrel was the first time CALCM missiles were used in combat., USAF The AGM-86 family of missiles really represented huge leaps in capability when they were designed. In fact, the type even starred in a James Bond movie. But technology has certainly moved on and freeing-up funds that would be allocated to supporting old, less capable missiles that could be used to purchase new, cutting-edge ones, does make some sense. This is especially true as standoff cruise missiles will be absolutely critical in kicking-down the enemy’s air defenses in the open stages of any major conflict. In the future, they will be able to swarm cooperatively as well, bringing a whole other level of lethality to what is an established and high-demand capability . It’s not clear exactly how many AGM-86s remain in the inventory at this time, but the Air Force fact sheet as of August of 2019 states: AGM-86B, active force: 536; AGM-86C: 186, Block 0: 12; Block I: 174, AGM-86D: 34 So, we are talking about a maximum of 406 missiles being disassembled or set for disassembly as the CALCM program winds down once and for all.

Combined with the stealthy missile’s enhanced capabilities, the BUFF has never been more capable of delivering devastating conventional attacks from far over the horizon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are blessed with a constant flow of great aviation photos in the digital photography age, but once in a while we come across an image that is truly spectacular and totally unique. Case in point, Keith Meachem’s photo of a Royal Netherlands Air Force Block 20 F-16A MLU (Mid-Life Upgrade) popping flares high over the Arizona desert at sunset. Not only is the photo striking in its composition and timing, but its exposure in a very challenging lighting situation is absolutely perfect. Simply put, it couldn’t be any more marvelous, it truly represents flawless execution. The image was taken during a photo shoot organized by our good friend and contributor to The War Zone , Rich Cooper, owner of the Centre Of Aviation Photography. Flying in a Short Skyvan that is usually used as a skydiving platform for Skydive Arizona, Keith pointed his Sony A7R IV DSLR with a Sony 24-70mm F/2.8 GM lens out the open rear ramp as the RNLAF Viper flew in formation behind it, grabbing the iconic fighter at a unique angle just as it popped a flare. The shoot took over the desert expanse southwest of Tucson. The 148th Fighter Squadron, which trains RNLAF F-16 pilots, calls Tucson Air National Guard Base at Tucson International Airport home. The unit is far from camera shy, nor is the RNLAF in general . Some of the best F-16 photos around have Dutch Vipers as their subjects. In this case, the whole shoot was closely coordinated with COAP and 148th Fighter Squadron personnel. It’s a win-win. They can get some truly incredible photos of their jets in action and do some formation and intercept work behind the slow-flying Skyvan and the photographers get what for many would be a once in a lifetime experience. Rich Cooper is a master at setting up such rare encounters and the proof is in the almost too consistent products that result from them. So many incredible photos come from these outings that it is easy to take them for granted, but that is a very good problem to have for Rich and his team.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 23, 2020",Japanese Shipbuilder Pitches Amphibious Assault Ship For Country’s Growing Marine Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Japanese shipbuilder has unveiled a design for a future landing helicopter dock amphibious assault ship, or LHD, that it plans to pitch to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, or JMSDF. Though the Japanese government has not publicly expressed an interest in such a vessel, this pitch comes as the country is working to expand its maritime and amphibious capabilities, with particularly notable plans to modify its Izumo class “helicopter destroyers” to support robust naval aviation operations that will include detachments of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . Japanese authorities can not have missed China’s launch of its first new, massive Type 075 LHD earlier this year or that South Korea is also exploring the possibility of acquiring a new, larger landing platform helicopter amphibious assault ship, or LPH, either. The Japan Marine United Corporation, or JMU, revealed the LHD design at the DSEI Japan 2019 exhibition, which ran from Nov. 18 to Nov. 20, 2019. Japan’s Universal Shipbuilding Corporation and IHI Marine United Inc. merged to become JMU in 2013. IHI had received the contract to begin building the first-in-class Izumo and JMU was subsequently responsible for the construction of that ship, as well as its sister ship, the Kaga . IHI had also previously built the two smaller Hyuga class helicopter destroyers for the JMSDF. JMU says that its LHD design, at present, would have a displacement of approximately 19,000 tons and an overall length of around 720 feet, according to Jane’s 360 . This would make it substantially smaller than China’s Type 075 or South Korea’s proposed LPH-II design , as well as the U.S. Navy’s Wasp class , which serves as a benchmark of sorts for large LHDs. Another artist’s conception of JMU’s LHD concept, offering a look at some of the proposed internal features., JMU The ship will have a large flight deck on top capable of supporting Japan’s V-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, as well as helicopters. Japan received its first Osprey in 2017 and has plans to eventually acquire a fleet of 17 of them. The LHD would have a well deck below that can accommodate up to two American-made Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC), according to JMU. The ship will also be able to conduct roll-on/roll-off operations in a more traditional port setting. One graphic that JMU release of the LHD concept shows it carrying five Ospreys on its main flight deck and another five in hangars below. The same image shows the ship carrying a load of BAE Systems AAV7A1 amphibious tracked personnel carriers and 6×6 tactical trucks, as well as the pair of LCACs. A Japan Ground Self-Defense Forces AAV7A1 amphibious tracked personnel carrier., USMC JMU has not said how many personnel the ship could carry in total, including the landing force, but has said that it would have a standing crew of around 500 . There is also no word yet on what other notable systems the vessel might have, such as radars, sensors, or weapons. The concept art the shipbuilder provided did show an extensive close-in protection suite with what appears to be three SeaRAM launchers for the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile positioned at the stern and in front of the ship’s island, as well as a Mk 15 Phalanx 20mm-Vulcan cannon-armed Close-in Weapon System (CIWS) on the forward deck. A JMU representative told Jane’s 360 that the JMSDF does not have a requirement for the LHD of any kind, but that the company was still expecting it to issue one in the coming years. It would certainly make good sense for that service to acquire this kind of capability sooner rather than later. Just last year, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) stood up the country’s first dedicated marine unit, the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade , since the end of World War II. It is the only user of the AAV7A1 armored vehicles, which JMU made a point of saying that its LHD would be able to carry. More than a decade ago, Japan began taking steps to create this unit primarily to address concerns about its ability to assert its claims over the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Protecting these islets, which China also lays claim to, during a potential conflict has been a major driver of other significant Japanese defense modernization efforts, including the Izumo class refit to accommodate the F-35B and the development of ground-launched hypersonic boost-glide vehicles . At present, the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade would have to largely rely on the JMSDF’s three Osumi class amphibious warfare ships. Japan classifies as tank landing ships, but, with their well deck, these are closer in general configuration to what most navies would call landing platform docks. The first-in-class Osumi with an array of vehicles, including a 4×4 Komatsu Light Armored Vehicle , second from the left of the vehicles in front, and an 8×8 Type 96 armored personnel carrier at the far right., Japan Ministry of Defense In 2014, Japan did announce plans to refit these ships to be able to accommodate MV-22s and AAV7A1s. Even so, the capabilities of these vessels, which displace 14,000 tons with a full load and can carry just 330 troops each for long-duration operations. This means that all three could carry only around a third of the expected final size of the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade at once. For shorter stints, these ships can carry up to 1,000 troops, but would still have relatively limited room for vehicles and other equipment. As such, even with certain upgrades, the Osumis would remain limited capability-wise compared to the design that JMU is now offering to build. The Izumos and Hyugas could carry additional troops, as well as Osprey and helicopters, but again lack the well deck to deploy amphibious vehicles or LCACs carrying other heavy equipment. For Japan, even a small fleet of LHDs could allow the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade to flex its muscles more throughout East Asia and elsewhere in the Pacific, where the country has increasingly diverse security concerns. North Korea presents an immediate threat and has recently begun conducting increasingly worrisome missile launches , among other shows of force . This has already prompted Japanese authorities to make a number of defense-related investments, including the acquisition of Aegis Ashore missile defense sites equipped with Lockheed Martin’s new AN/SPY-7(V)1 Solid State Radar. North Korean belligerence has also been a factor in the decision to integrate the F-35B onto the Izumo class ships. Former Japan Self-Defense Forces Chief of Staff Shigeru Iwasaki had also said at the DSEI Japan exhibition that the “ballistic-missile defense function” of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force’s existing F-35As has made them a particularly valuable addition to the country’s military already, according to Aviation Week . What he was referring to was the Joint Strike Fighter’s demonstrated ability to spot and track ballistic missile launches and feed relevant information back to command centers on the ground, such as those in the future Aegis Ashore facilities. This could become even more critical in the near future as a separate political spat between Japan and South Korea led to the latter to threaten to scrap an intelligence-sharing agreement that, in part, had provided a mechanism for the exchange of information about North Korean missile activity. The current Japanese government has also shown that it is eager to be involved in challenging China’s broad and controversial claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea and potentially expand its ability to conduct military activities further beyond its borders in service to Japan’s broader foreign policy aims. The Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade is seen as an important component of these efforts and elements of the unit have been participating in increasing numbers of multi-national exercises in the Pacific region in recent years. Just in October, the brigade sent personnel to the Philippines to join that country and the United States in the annual Kamandag exercise. There has been a push in recent years to amend the country’s constitution to either eliminate Article Nine , which prohibits the country from engaging in any offensive military activities anywhere, or modify it substantially to give the Japan Self-Defense Forces greater leeway to operate regionally and globally. LHDs, supporting the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, would be valuable tools for projecting power far beyond Japan’s home islands. In addition, JMU made sure to point out that the LHD design would feature substantial onboard medical facilities and that it could support non-combat humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions. This could be useful for Japan domestically, which is regularly in the path of extreme weather such as typhoons and tsunamis , such as the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami , which led to a near-meltdown at the Fukushima Daini nuclear powerplant. These same capabilities could also make the ships important soft power tools for Japan and simply give the country additional capacity to aid its regional allies in the wake of disasters. At the same time, JMU’s LHD proposal may be more capability than the JMSDF might actually need or be able to make effective use of, especially if the country’s constitution remains largely unchanged and prevents the service from taking on more offensive roles. Japan may decide it is more cost-effective to develop a smaller landing platform dock-style ship as a direct follow-on to Osumi class instead, which could then operate as part of a larger amphibious force in concert with the Izumos or Hyugas. All told, it remains to be seen what a Japanese LHD might look like, or what its specific capabilities might be, or even if and when the country decides to purchase such a ship at all.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 5, 2020",Navy Plans For ‘Large Payload Subs’ Based On New Columbia Class To Take On SSGN Role And More,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has started exploring its options for a next-generation nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile to arm its future Columbia -class ballistic missile submarines and that design will incorporate elements of the existing Trident D-5 . At the same time, the service will keep the Columbia production line “hot” to potentially build more of those boats or produce a conventionally-armed, multi-purpose “Large Payload Submarine.” This latter design could end up packed with cruise missiles or hypersonic weapons , be able to act as an undersea mothership for special operations forces or large underwater drones , and more. Various naval officers offered updates on the future of the Navy’s strategic and other large submarine capabilities during talks at the Naval Submarine League’s annual symposium on Nov. 8, 2018. At present, the service expects to purchase at least 12 Columbias to replace its existing 14 Ohio -class ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs. There are also plans to buy a minimum of five of the as yet unnamed Large Payload Submarine, also known as the Large-Volume Host Platform , primarily to replace the four additional Ohios that have been reconfigured as conventional cruise missile and special operations submarines, or SSGNs . “What we are going to do is we’re going to keep the Columbia line hot,” U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Tammen, head of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operation’s Undersea Warfare Division, said . “That gives us the option, if STRATCOM [U.S. Strategic Command] says we need more than 12, well then we can produce more than 12.” A wide array of different factors will influence that decision. Once the Ohio SSBNs leave service, the Columbias will form the full extent of the third leg of the United States’ nuclear triad , a key component of America’s nuclear deterrent. As such, it will be essential to ensure that there are enough of the new submarines to adequately meet those demands. An artists conception of the future USS Columbia ., USN General Dynamics Electric Boat, with assistance from Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding, is still finalizing the Columbia ‘s design. Both companies will produce the submarines, with the construction scheduled to start on the lead ship in 2020. To try and help reduce costs, the Navy has already been ordering various components, including pre-fabricated Common Missile Compartment sections, each of which has four missile launch tubes. In August 2018, a quality control problem with the welds in some of those tubes emerged, which has now turned over to be extensive enough to require at least $27 million in repairs and a year of total time to fix. The Navy insists this will not impact the production schedule for the boats, which will cost approximately $7.2 billion each . Any further issues with the design or future construction might alter the Navy’s planned production totals. The figures are also based on an understanding of the deterrent requirements, which could always change in the coming years due to geopolitical concerns . That understanding could further evolve as the service starts to define what its next submarine-launched ballistic missile, which will replace the existing Trident D-5, will look like. “If you look at the decisions that we made on Columbia , as we went down to 16 [launch] tubes [from 24 on the Ohios ], part of that decision was made because there was an assumption that the reliability of this [follow-on] weapon system way out in the 2070s and 2080s will be just as reliable and supportable as it is today with the current Trident,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, director of Strategic Systems Programs, explained at the Naval Submarine League event. What the Navy is presently calling Trident D-5 Life Extension 2, D5LE2, “won’t look like the D-5 that we’ve got today, it won’t be completely new, it will be somewhere in the middle,” he added. The Ohio -class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland fires a Trident D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missile during a test., USN This new-ish missile is expected to stay in service through 2084, They will fully replace the existing D-5 Life Extension variant, or D5LE, which entered service in 2013, by around 2042. The Navy has yet to define what the improvements will be, but they will almost certainly include updated guidance and control systems with improved protection against electronic warfare and cyber attacks and espionage , additional countermeasures to defeat any enemy defenses, and reliability enhancements. They may also have new or modified nuclear warheads with scaleable, “ dial-a-yield ” effects. All of this could impact the final number of Columbias the Navy decides to buy. The U.S. military’s most recent Nuclear Posture Review calls for a minimum of 12 of the submarines, but does not state any firm maximum number. That same policy document outlined a controversial plan for both submarine-launched ballistic missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles armed with lower-yield warheads, which you can read about more here and here . President Donald Trump’s administration has also been pushing for expanding the U.S. nuclear arsenal and has shown a disdain for international arms control agreements . At present, the United States is limited in how many SSBNs it can have at all by the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( New START ) with Russia. That agreement places hard limits on the total number various categories of deployed and non-deployed land-based intercontinental ballistic missile systems, submarine-launched ballistic missile systems, and nuclear-capable bombers . By only having 16 tubes per submarine on the Columbias , versus the 24 on the Ohios , the United States had already set the stage to free up room to potentially add in more SSBNs, or other systems the treaty covers, in the future. The USS Ohio with her missile tubes open for inspection., USN The arrangement will sunset no later than 2026, as well, which could render the entire issue moot if the United States and Russia can’t agree on a new arms control deal. The Navy doesn’t expect the future USS Columbia to head out on her first deterrent patrol until 2031. If there still doesn’t end up being a demand for more Columbias , the Navy already has a plan, though. “If STRATCOM doesn’t need more than 12, then we’re looking at what we call the Large-Volume Host Platform, where we’ll take that center section — we haven’t nailed down the concept — but there will be the ability to host vehicles on board inside that center section,” Rear Admiral Tammen said . The existence of this proposed submarine first public appeared in a report the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released in October 2018 that reviewed Navy’s latest shipbuilding plan for the 2019 through 2048 Fiscal Years. At present, the service already expects to buy one of these ships every three years after construction of the 12th Columbia class boat ends in 2036. A chart showing the Navy’s expected fleet sizes, including a portion representing its planned inventory of attack submarines, SSGNs, and Large Payload Submarines, between 2019 and 2048., CBO “The Navy provides little information about the size and capabilities of the large payload submarine,” the CBO noted . “CBO assumed that it would be based on the Columbia class hull with its missile tube section reconfigured to perform whatever missions the Navy might want and that other sections of the ship would receive the necessary equipment and modifications to support the payloads the submarine might carry.” Those payloads remain almost entirely undefined, but would likely include some configuration of vertical launch system (VLS) arrays that could accommodate land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles , including a top-secret supersonic submarine-launched anti-ship weapons now under development, and conventionally-armed hypersonic weapons . The ships would also be able to insert and extract special operations forces and deploy and recover unmanned undersea vehicles . A proposal from General Dynamics Electric Boat about how to turn a launch tube on the Ohio -class SSGNs into a hangar for unmanned undersea vehicles., General Dynamics Electric Boat These are all existing and planned missions for the Ohio SSGNs and late-block Virginia-class attack submarines, the latter of which will feature a so-called Virginia Payload Module (VPM) with four, large multi-purpose launch tubes. The VLS capacity the converted Ohios already offer – each one can carry up to 154 Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles – means those four ships are in particularly high demand , which also puts serious strains on their crews. Unfortunately, the four Ohio SSGNs are also among the oldest boats in that class. The last one is supposed to head into retirement in 2026, after which the VPM-equipped Virginias are supposed to take over. Those smaller submarines won’t be able to provide nearly the same amount of capability, though. Having a true replacement SSGN, and possibly more of them in total, would give Navy more conventional submarine firepower and other capabilities available in case a major conflict erupts. The large size of a Columbia -based submarine could add additional flexibility, allowing it to act as a massive undersea mothership for the Navy’s planned family of large, long-range unmanned undersea vehicles, which themselves will be able to perform a host of different missions. It may even allow for them to launch larger drone submarines in the future. The Navy has no capability like that at present, but only needs to look at Russia’s investments in those kinds of special purpose submarines to see the potential benefits. The Russian Navy has a diverse fleet of mothership subs that can deploy deep-sea intelligence gathering platforms and launch nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed torpedoes and submersibles that may be able to strike at targets at extreme ranges. A graphic showing potential missions for large unmanned undersea vehicles from the US Navy’s 2004 underwater drone roadmap., USN Depending on the Large Payload Submarine’s other performance characteristics, one or more of the boats might be able to take on more specialized missions, such as tapping undersea cables or sensitive salvage operations. The USS Jimmy Carter , last of the Seawolf -class attack submarines, gained a similar special mission mid-section and now focuses on intelligence gathering and underwater espionage missions. The Navy is also hoping that the commonality in design with the Columbia will keep down the cost of the Large Payload Submarines. The service estimates that the unit price will be around $7 billion. CBO warns that the lack of clarity about the scope of the modifications to the existing design may lead to a greater cost per boat, closer to $7.6 billion, in the end. A graphic showing the USS Jimmy Carter ‘s Multi-Mission Platform hull section. The Large Payload Submarine may have similar capabilities with its new multi-purpose section., USN All of this comes amid a renaissance with regards to submarine and anti-submarine warfare capabilities within the Navy, driven primarily by concerns about advancing capabilities among potential “great power” competitors, such as Russia and China . In addition to its plans for its largest submarines, the service is also looking to develop a new class of larger attack submarines , as well as a host of other undersea capabilities . However many Columbias and Large Payload Submarines the Navy ultimately buys, a mix of SSBNs with improved ballistic missiles and SSGN-like multi-mission boats looks set to offer the service important boosts in capability and capacity to conduct both strategic and conventional operations for decades to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2018",Russia Even Ripped Out The Toilets Before Returning Ukraine’s Ships It Seized,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Ukrainian Navy’s top officer has decried the condition of three boats it just got back nearly a year after Russia seized them during a brief, but serious skirmish in the Kerch Strait, which links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov . Ukraine says that the Russians stripped the two gunboats and tug of various fixtures, including mundane items, such as their toilets, and otherwise left them in disrepair. Russian forces took control of the Berdyansk and Nikopol , a pair of Gyurza-M class patrol boats, which Ukraine refers to as “artillery boats,” as well as the tug Yany Kapu , a year ago on Nov. 25, 2018. Russia towed the ships out of the Port of Kerch on Nov. 17, 2019, and officially turned them back over to Ukrainian officials off the coast of the Crimean Peninsula the next day. Russia had also detained the crews of the three ships, 24 sailors in total, three of whom were injured after Russian security forces rammed and shot at the ships during the altercation. The Kremlin freed these individuals in September as part of a prisoner exchange . “They do not go on their own,” Ukrainian Navy Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko, the service’s present commander, said in an interview with Ukraine’s Channel 4 on Nov. 20, 2019. “The Russians ruined them – even took off lamps, power outlets, and toilets.” Voronchenko said that this was why it took the boats so long to return to a Ukrainian port after the transfer. The trio of vessels arrived at the Port of Ochakiv on the Black Sea to the west of Crimea, where Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly met them, on Nov. 20. https://youtube.com/watch?v=029dsLaL36w The exact extent of what the Russians removed from the three boats, and any damage they might have otherwise done to them, is unclear. For instance, pictures and videos show that the weapons on Berdyansk and Nikopol are clearly still in place, though reports say Russia kept the ammunition. Other notable external features, such as navigation radar antennas, also appear to still be in place. “We will show the whole world the Russian barbarism towards them,” Voronchenko added in his comments to Channel 4, suggesting that more evidence of Russia’s poor handling the boats could be coming soon. At the time of writing, Russia does not appear to have responded in any way to Voronchenko’s remarks. The Gyurza-M class patrol boat Nikopol arrives in the Port of Ochakiv., OLEKSANDR GIMANOV/AFP via Getty Images It would certainly not be hard to see Russia seeking to undermine Ukraine’s ability to put the boats back into service quickly. Russia’s official position is that the Ukrainian vessels failed to make the proper preparations and follow appropriate instructions from Russian coast guard personnel while transiting the Kerch Strait last year, but the real reason for the incident appears to have been an attempt on the Kremlin’s part to challenge Ukraine’s ability to access the strategic Sea of Azov. The Russians had already put additional restrictions in place regarding Ukrainian transits through the Strait after illegally seizing the Crimea region in 2014. This was in spite of a deal that Moscow and Kyiv cut in 2003 that was supposed to guarantee both countries could readily move in and out of the Sea of Azov. The Kremlin also only agreed to release the ships in advance of the upcoming summit in Paris to discuss potential paths to ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This meeting is scheduled to take place in Paris, France on Dec. 9, with French and German representatives also in attendance. Since seizing Crimea in 2014, Russian forces have also been actively supporting separatists , who are themselves heavily linked to Russia’s intelligence services, in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region. On the surface, returning the ships seems to be a goodwill gesture, but their apparent condition would seem to imply that Russia continues to be defiant in the face of sanctions and international criticism of its involvement in the fighting in Donbass, seeing itself as still having the stronger negotiating position. It’s worth remembering that in May the United Nations’ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which is situated in Germany, ruled that Ukraine was the aggrieved party in the November 2018 skirmish and ordered Russia to immediately release the captured boats and sailors. The Kremlin defied that ruling, only turning the sailors back over to Ukraine as part of a prisoner swap deal. In return, Russia secured the freedom of individuals directly linked to the shootdown of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in 2014. A new report on that tragedy that the Dutch-led Joint Investigative Team (JIT) released just last week disclosed new evidence, including intercepted phone calls , showing that the forces in Donbass that brought down the airliner and killed the 298 people on board were operating under direct orders from Russian security services at the time. Going into the summit next month, Russia’s position does appear to be relatively strong, given that Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has found his government tied up in one of the most serious U.S. political scandals in recent memory. This has to do with U.S. President Donald Trump’s apparent attempt to prompt Ukrainian authorities by withholding military aid to investigate Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, over business dealings in Ukraine as a way of launching a political attack on his father. Zelenskiy, who made ending the conflict in Donbass a key campaign promise, has already shown a certain willingness to make concessions, such as the prisoner swap in September and an agreement with Russian-backed separatists to withdraw troops from certain front line areas the next month. At the same time, he has also voiced support for trying to join NATO , which can only draw the Kremlin’s ire. Russia very clearly wants to bring Ukraine back into its sphere of influence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at right, greets Ukrainian Navy sailors after their arrival at Boryspil International Airport in Kyiv following a prisoner swap with Russia in September 2019., Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/Sipa USA via AP At the same time, Russia is already riding high on recent victories in Syria, where a sudden U.S. withdrawal in the face of a Turkish intervention has rolled back American positions in the country and allowed the Kremlin, as well as Syrian regime allies, to make considerable gains . Turkey has also moved even further into Russia’s orbit , and away from its NATO allies, as a result. Russian forces occupying facilities that U.S. personnel had previously occupied and, in many cases, appear to have hastily abandoned , has been a propaganda coup for Moscow, as well. The Kremlin’s decision to send Berdyansk , Nikopol , and Yany Kapu back to Ukraine ahead of the Paris summit does seem to be intended as a signal of its willingness to negotiate, at least on the surface. However, if it’s true that Russian personnel ripped out the toilets and otherwise left the boats in a state of serious disrepair, the message Moscow might actually be sending is that it still feels that it can act arbitrarily and with impunity toward Kyiv and there’s little it thinks the current Ukrainian government can do about it.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still very limited, but SpaceX’s Starship Mk 1 prototype suffered a serious accident during a ground test less than an hour ago. The space launch company is testing the prototype of the reusable spacecraft at its facilities outside of Boca Chica in southern Texas. You can watch the mishap occur in the video below. It starts some 20 minutes before the end of this particular live stream from the site. Pressure testing of prototype Starship Mk 1 reportedly began on Nov. 18, 2019. SpaceX’s founder and CEO Elon Musk had formally unveiled the project in September 2019. The vehicle is the second stage of a two-stage-to-orbit reusable private space transportation system that the company hopes will support space tourism and other private space travel in the future. The project has drawn considerable attention and there have been multiple 24/7 live streams of work being done at Boca Chica. Other views of the accident are already rolling in. The craft’s stainless steel body appears to have sustained significant damage in the incident. Musk touted the durability of the material repeatedly in the past, so maybe it will be able to be repaired. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 5:45pm EST— Neither SpaceX nor Elon Musk has issued a formal statement about the accident yet, but the company’s founder and CEO has responded to a Twitter post suggesting that the mishap might be a good time to simply move on to the next Starship prototype iteration rather than repair the existing Mk 1. Musk seemed to agree, replying “Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This [the Mk 1] had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different.” There’s still no word yet on exactly what might have caused the explosion at the Boca Chica site. SpaceX is also building a Mk 2 prototype at a different facility in Cocoa, Florida. This one apparently needed some work the other day to reposition a bulkhead that required individuals to take a sledgehammer to it. UPDATE: 8:15pm EST— SpaceX has now provided a statement to multiple outlets about the accident, which is as follows: The purpose of today’s test was to pressurize systems to the max, so the outcome was not completely unexpected. There were no injuries, nor is this a serious setback. As Elon tweeted, Mk1 served as a valuable manufacturing pathfinder but flight design is quite different. The decision had already been made to not fly this test article and the team is focused on the Mk3 builds, which are designed for orbit. NASASpaceFlight.com has reported that the accident occurred during the first cryogenic load testing of the Mk 1 prototype. The outlet provided additional video that showed the top bulkhead being blown away from the main body and landing some distance away. The video also showed the bottom bulkhead failing.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last evening, the Israeli Air Force launched an aerial offensive against multiple targets in Syria as retaliation for a quartet of rockets that were fired toward Israel the day before. The Syrian government claimed that their air defenses shot down the majority of Israeli missiles before they struck their targets, a highly predictable and dubious statement to say the least. In fact, a video shows what appears to be Syrian surface-to-air missiles flying directly into the ground shortly after launch. In the video, the first two missiles are seen rising from the ground and taking a shallow trajectory, impacting the ground nearby. The second missile could have been attempting a very low-altitude engagement attempt, but that seems unlikely. A third missile does climb out successfully, but it isn’t clear if it hit anything, failed, or self-destructed overhead: המתיחות בצפון | מערכות ההגנה האווירית של סוריה במהלך תקיפות צה""ל הלילה במדינה @LiranHaroni pic.twitter.com/o8UCHps1lQ — חדשות 13 (@newsisrael13) November 20, 2019 Even the best and most modern surface-to-air missiles fail , but Israel’s use of advanced standoff weapons , often fired from Lebanese airspace , along with advanced electronic warfare tactics and careful route planning , have allowed it to strike targets in Syria at will for years, even in and around Damascus, the war-torn country’s capital. The Assad regime’s air defenses are made up primarily of Soviet-era surface-to-air missile systems that have received some upgrades over the years. It does have a number of Russian-made Pantsir point air defense systems guarding high-value sites, but those too have proven to have a spotty if not ineffectual record. Russia very publicly equipped Syria with the S-300 air defense system, but just as we predicted at the time, they seem not to be a factor when it comes to Israeli attacks. This is either by Russia’s design or by Israel’s use of tactics that largely circumvent the S-300’s more advanced capabilities. In fact, both possibilities could be true, depending on the situation. Usually, Israel says little to nothing about its air operations over Syria, but in this case, the offensive was not aimed at Iranian weapons shipments to Hezbollah exclusively. Instead, it was a higher-profile punitive strike operation. As such, we are getting more information about what was targeted. Israel says the targets hit belonged to the Syrian military and Iran—namely the country’s Quds Force, which is the foreign operations arm of Iran’s hardline Revolutionary Guard . Dozens of targets were attacked, including air defense sites, weapons storage areas, headquarters facilities, and military bases. Satellite imagery taken after the strikes shows a number of structures damaged or destroyed, including Quds Force’s “Glasshouse” headquarters facility at Damascus International Airport and another Quds Force command and control facility at Al Mazzeh Air Base, which is also located in Damascus. So, we are talking about some very high-profile targets here. Thread – 2/4: The #Iran |ian #QudsForce HQ in #Damascus intl. airport, AKA the #Glasshouse .

The fear of a more direct conflict between Syria and Israel has been palpable at various points in time in recent years, but both sides have other problems that are more pressing and the Israeli Air Force continues to do what it needs to over Syria in a largely unchecked manner. Still, Israel has been on the lookout for a similar attack as what occurred in Saudi Arabia last Fall. It is possible that a war in Syria could occur without the Assad regime really being a part of it if Iran were to activate its forces in the country and Hezbollah in Lebanon for an all-out bombardment of Israel. Israel has made it crystal clear that it will not tolerate Syria turning into an Iranian military superbase, with Defense Minister Naftali Bennett stating the following after the strikes: “The rules have changed: Anyone who shoots at the State of Israel during the day will not sleep at night. Like last week and now this week. Our message to Iran’s leaders is simple: You are no longer immune. Wherever you stretch your tentacles – we will hack them off. The IDF will continue to protect Israeli citizens.” Regardless, if the video above is any indicator, Assad’s air defenses may be a bigger danger to his own people than to Israeli air power.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 20, 2019",China’s Mysterious Spoofed GPS “Crop Circle” Has Something Interesting At Its Center,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We posted a story yesterday about a bizarre series of events in Shanghai, China where vessels’ GPS data has been spoofed and jammed, along with that of various other users of the near indispensable system, including those that use fitness tracker apps. The folks that are studying the strange circumstances surrounding these anomalies say they are stumped as to how this is being done or why the fake location data correlates into a ring around a seemingly random area along the bustling Huangpu River. We don’t have an answer to those questions, but after a bit of research, we may have discovered a major clue that could help in doing so. Make sure to read our story from yesterday by clicking here before continuing on for proper context and background. After the post was published, I sat back and thought how strange it was the data was manifesting itself in a relatively small ring as described. After staring at the renderings of the data overlaid on a crude map for a moment, I thought along our typical lines here at The War Zone —what about hardware? Was this circular anomaly manifesting itself by design or is it actually a byproduct of the method in which the tactics are being deployed? My gut said the latter. With that in mind, and without getting into the weeds trying to dream-up the exact concept being executed here or the technology that enables it, I asked myself, what may be needed to make some sort of jamming and spoofing capability a reality within line of sight of the strange data ring? You are probably already thinking the same thing—the high ground. A radio antenna structure or high-rise could be essential and may have to do with the odd dispersion of coordinates. A “crop circle” of spoofed GPS locations in Shanghai that C4ADS discovered when it plotted the compromised AIS data., C4ADS Another “crop circle” that appears on Strava’s Global Heat Map., Strava Now it was time to find exactly where this was happening. We did not have the precise coordinates of where the ring was appearing, just very crude and zoomed-in maps posted by the researchers. We are used to this type of thing when it comes to image and geospatial intelligence gathering and within a few minutes, we found a match for the roadways and the orientation of the river shown in the two graphics we had. There was no question as to the accuracy of the anomaly’s location. And what do you know? Right in the center of where the ring of data points was located was a huge smokestack—one of two that are part of a sprawling plant operated by Shanghai Gaore Industries. Bloomberg describes the company as a distributor of “coal and other minerals and ores.” Google Earth Google Earth Google earth In the available satellite imagery, the smokestack appears to be hundreds of feet high, offering a perfect perch for which to install whatever gear could be involved in this GPS data tampering operation. The location also appears to offer unique lines of sight of the river both in front of the nearby perpendicular bank and down through where the river curves at both its north and south ends, at least to some degree. Even the main channel to the east would have been in range. There was only one problem, would a working smokestack really be conducive to also working as an electronics mounting platform? Maybe so, and the stack in question looks like it has a number of catwalks installed a collar-like arrangement at various heights, but it still seems like a complication. Once again, what do you know? This particular stack seems to be entirely dormant or abandoned, with its nearby twin bellowing away consistently in satellite imagery. In fact, in all the satellite photos we could find, the smokestack in question hasn’t emitted anything going all the way back to 2011. Google earth Still, just because something exists exactly where you hypothesized it would, that doesn’t mean it is being used for what you think it is. Coincidences happen all too often when it comes to these kinds of situations. In addition, it is easy enough to attach aerials and arrays to an abandoned smokestack, but still, it isn’t exactly a purpose-built radio tower. An yet again , exactly that appears in the timeframe when supposedly, at least to our knowledge, these anomalies began occurring. After reviewing dozens of proprietary satellite photos spanning the last two years, out of nowhere, on the road just next to where the smokestack is located, a remarkably tall red radio tower pops up out of literally nowhere in the second half of 2018. At first, I thought it may be a crane, but I cannot see any sort of swing arm in any of the satellite images I have reviewed, nor is there any signs of construction. In fact, it looks exactly like a very tall radio tower, appearing similar in height as the smokestack just a stone’s throw away and plunked down right in the middle of the road located on the western edge of the plant. Radio tower-like structure and its shadow. , Google earth From what we can tell, the tower disappeared right around the end of 2018 or the first days into 2019. I have no idea if it had been moved to another area or if its functions were transferred to the smokestack or whatever, but its presence correlates with the available geolocation ‘ring’ data perfectly. The timeframe in which it is present and how it relates to that same data temporarily remains a question that we are looking into. Taken as a whole, this evidence points to the possibility that some sort of hardware is present at the center of the mysterious ring. If that is indeed the case, we still don’t know who that hardware may belong to or what that entity’s goals are. Still, the presence of a very high perch exactly where I thought it would be may help investigators to come up with new hypotheses as to what exactly is happening and how it is happening. I certainly have my own ideas, but we’ll save those for another day.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 20, 2019",New Type Of GPS Spoofing Attack In China Creates “Crop Circles” Of False Location Data,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new type of GPS spoofing technology, which may belong to the Chinese government, appears to have been impacting shipping in and around China’s Port of Shanghai for more than a year. Unlike previous examples of spoofing attacks, which have typically caused GPS receivers in a certain area to show their locations as being at a limited number of fixed false positions, the incidents in Shanghai caused the transponders on multiple ships at once to show various erroneous positions that forms odd ring-like patterns that some experts have dubbed “crop circles.” An article in MIT Technology Review magazine on Nov. 15, 2019, was among the first to delve into the data. The information had come from an investigation that the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, or C4ADS , a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, had previously conducted into what has been happening in Shanghai. Todd Humphreys, the head of the Radionavigation Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, an expert in GPS jamming, spoofing, and hacking , who had been assisting C4ADS, gave a presentation on the topic at the ION GNSS+ satellite navigation conference in Florida in September. C4ADS has conducted a number of data-driving investigations since 2012, including one in July of this year on the smuggling of luxury goods, including foreign cars , into North Korea. Another one that the organization published four months earlier delved into Russian GPS spoofing and jamming activities in Ukraine’s Crimea region and the Black Sea , elsewhere in Europe , and Syria . Russia has been conducting these kinds of attacks for years and they are well known at this point. However, instances of spoofing linked to the Russians have, typically, caused affected receivers to think that they’re all in one incorrect location. A series of such attacks in the Black Sea in 2017 notably caused numerous ships to register their locations at a single point several miles inland. A graphic showing how Russian GPS spoofing incidents in the Black Sea between 2016 and 2018 shifted locations of ships to a limited number of locations, all airports, on land., C4ADS C4ADS had not initially been expecting to find anything necessarily unusual about the GPS spoofing in Shanghai after reportedly receiving a tip earlier this year, according to MIT Technology Review . The fact that the port might be experiencing these kinds of attacks was backed up in part by a report that the captain of U.S.-flagged container ship M/V Manukai had filed with the U.S. Coast Guard in July 2018. In that case, as the ship approached the port, another vessel disappeared and reappeared multiple times from its screens, with its transponder alternating between showing its position in one of the traffic lanes and in its berth. The captain of the Manukai eventually confirmed that the other ship had never left the pier. His own ship’s GPS systems failed completely as they made their way to their own place on the dock, in what sounds like may have just been more traditional jamming. The M/V Manukai ., Matson The International Maritime Organization requires most civilian and commercial ships to have a GPS-linked Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder and broadcast their locations while underway specifically to help ships avoid colliding with each other or other hazards at sea. The risks are very real. For example, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) found that half of all shipping mishaps that it recorded in 2017 were, at least in part, due to navigation errors that subsequently led to a collision or a ship finding itself grounded on land. C4ADS purchased a significant amount of AIS transponder data from in and around the Port of Shanghai from an unspecified startup company, which further confirmed spoofing attacks occurring at least as far back as Summer 2018. This was clear from AIS data that showed ships’ positions on land rather than in the port itself. When C4ADS then went to plot the spoofed ship locations to create a visualization of the data, they discovered something entirely new and very odd. Circular patterns appeared that were unlike any the researchers, and the experts they then reached out to, had ever seen. “To be able to spoof multiple ships simultaneously into a circle is extraordinary technology. It looks like magic,” Humphreys, the expert from the University of Texas at Austin, told MIT Technology Review . “People were slack-jawed when I showed them this pattern of spoofing [at the ION GNSS+ conference]. They started to call it crop circles.” A “crop circle” of spoofed GPS locations in Shanghai that C4ADS discovered when it plotted the compromised AIS data., C4ADS It also wasn’t just ships that were suffering the effects. C4ADS found that similar “crop circles” in Shanghai using Strava’s “ Global Heat Map .” This company, which bills itself as a social fitness network, creates this map from the anonymized data that its app collects from users’ smartwatches and similar devices. This is ostensibly meant to show things like popular running and cycling routes, as well as general athletic activity. The company did find itself at the center of a controversy last year when it became apparent that the heat map was also effectively highlighting the locations of military and intelligence facilities around the world. What it was showing in Shanghai was that cyclists and anyone else in the city who were using Strava’s app were also subjected to the curious spoofing attacks. Another “crop circle” that appears on Strava’s Global Heat Map., Strava “I’m still puzzled by this,” Humphreys continued. “I can’t get it to work out in the math.” MIT Technology Review did not offer any technical explanations as to how the spoofing might have occurred. It is known that commercially available systems are capable, under certain circumstances, of showing a single object, even one that is actually stationary, moving along an entirely fake route . Creating any sort of pattern involving multiple objects at once is much more complicated, according to Humphreys. It’s also not clear who may be behind the attacks. One obvious possibility is that the Chinese government is using the Port of Shanghai as a testing ground for a new GPS spoofing system that its military or security forces could ultimately employ elsewhere. Since at least 2013, there have been reports that China may be launching electronic warfare attacks on manned and unmanned U.S. aircraft operating near its man-made islands in the South China Sea, for instance. GPS spoofing attacks could make it more complicated and create new risks for American aircraft and ships operating in this and other contested areas in the Pacific Region. Beyond these particular examples, as The War Zone has explored deeply in the past , GPS spoofing presents a very real and growing threat, in general. In the Pacific Region, or anywhere else, it could potentially throw ships, aircraft, and ground forces off course, creating confusion among opponents and the risks of serious accidents, slowing down the ability of an enemy force to maneuver and respond to new developments substantially. It could also impact the employment of precision-guided munitions that rely on satellite navigation to find their targets. This could reduce an enemy’s confidence in the ability to use these weapons safely and effectively, especially against targets that a very close to friendly forces or innocent bystanders. Of course, GPS is uniquely encrypted for the U.S. military and its allies, making its access to the system more resistant to spoofing and an improved family of encrypted receivers is also in development. N ew antennas that are also less susceptible to jamming attacks are also becoming available. None of these defenses are foolproof, however, there are also other fail-safes intended to mitigate spoofing attacks, as the War Zone ‘s Tyler Rogoway has noted in the past , writing: Advanced guidance and navigation systems, like those found on aircraft and in most GPS-guided weapons, use inertial navigation with embedded GPS. System software loaded onto the INS/GPS guidance system uses algorithms to detect discrepancies among various streams of information. This way the system can place less priority on one stream of information, say from a malfunctioning ring-laser gyro or GPS receiver, than others. Or it can discount that steam entirely if it starts straying far from the consensus of the others. This way a navigation system that suddenly loses a component due to failure or has one of its data streams deviate for other reasons won’t simply stop working. For instance, if the GPS telemetry suddenly leaps miles away, the navigation system may “vote out” the GPS information entirely. The system will be less accurate overall because of it, but it will still function. As an example, take a Joint Direct Attack Munition, the most common guided bomb used by the USAF, which uses GPS and INS navigation. If the system suddenly loses GPS connectivity during its attack sequence, INS will take over, but the bomb will be substantially less accurate than it would have been with both GPS and INS working together as a team. But spoofing isn’t as simple as telling a GPS receiver it is somewhere totally different than where it really is. By broadcasting false GPS data that slowly changes over time, navigational systems with GPS and INS may not “throw out” the GPS data so soon, or at all for that matter. Over time this could result in vehicles going far off course or even running into shores, mountains or even other vehicles without warning. Some say this is how the Iranians brought down the RQ-170 Sentinel drone in a relatively intact state in late November 2011, although this remains highly debatable. With all this in mind, the United States, among others, is already working in fielding GPS receivers that are better hardened against such attacks, as well. In addition, there has been a growing push to acquire and otherwise implement non-satellite navigation alternatives for ships, aircraft, and ground forces. The need for what the U.S. military has referred to as Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) to respond to what it has begun calling “ navigation warfare ” attacks is among the most critical and fastest emerging defense areas. Rather than develop a single substitute for GPS, this has included a layered, multi-faceted approach that includes a wide range of systems and other concepts. This renewed emphasis on map-and-compass land navigation and the use of automated celestial navigation systems, the latter of which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone feature . Precision-guided munitions with multi-mode seekers are also becoming increasingly popular in part because they can help mitigate the risks of GPS jamming and spoofing, as well as other electronic warfare attacks, during the munitions terminal phase of flight. There is also work being done on higher-tech solutions. This includes advanced and compact Inertial Navigation Systems that can be more readily employed on a variety of platforms. BAE Systems has previously proposed a concept called Navigation via Signals of Opportunity (NAVSOP) that would help provide PNT by leveraging other ambient electromagnetic emissions, such as signals from television stations, cell phones, or even electronic warfare jammers themselves. NAVSOP also offered the possibility to operate passively, which would be beneficial to stealthy aircraft, which need to keep their own emissions to an absolute minimum . Miniaturized atomic clocks could provide another part of the overall solution. An infographic showing the potential signal sources that could drive the NAVSOP concept., BAE Systems The United States and its allies are also increasingly training to fight in GPS-denied environments, well. This has included deliberately causing mass GPS outages in training areas to create a particularly realistic setting. Spoofing attacks also have the potential to wreak havoc in the commercial space for many of the same reasons. This reality has raised the possibility that the attacks on GPS systems in and around Shanghai may actually be the work of criminal elements, according to C4ADS. Smugglers trading in sand illegally dredged from the bottom of the Yangtze River – which is almost perfect for making cement, according to MIT Technology Review – have a long history of hacking into their AIS transponders to misreport their positions and elude authorities. The Huangpu River Maritime Safety Administration (MSA), which polices the immediate waterway around the port of Shanghai and says it was also subjected to the GPS spoofing, has reported instances of oil smugglers doing the same thing. These “ghost ships,” showing false positions, if their transponders are on at all, have become a menace, reportedly being at the root of 23 accidents on the Yangtze in 2018. This was more than half of all major accidents and resulted in the deaths of 53 people, according to MIT Technology Review ‘s report. Barges carrying sand and gravel on the Huangpu River, with the Shanghai skyline in the background, in 2017., Reinhard Kaufhold/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images Screwing with a ship’s own transponder signal, or switching them off entirely , is a common tactic employed by maritime smuggling operations around the world, too. Actively spoofing all GPS receivers in the area would certainly be a major escalation for criminal elements and being able to do so at this level of complexity would raise serious concerns about the capabilities for non-state actors to do the same elsewhere. Earlier this year, the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) issued alerts about potential GPS spoofing and jamming tied to Iran or Iranian proxies in waterways in the Middle East, showing that there are already concerns about this technology proliferating. Still, Humphreys, the University of Texas at Austin researcher, is unconvinced that a non-state actor could be behind as sophisticated an attack as the one in Shanghai. “I don’t think it’s some rogue actor,” he told MIT Technology Review . “I’m genuinely puzzled how this is being done.” If nothing else, the GPS spoofing that has been occurring in Shanghai only further underscores that the manipulation of GPS connectivity is a very real threat and is a wakeup call regarding just how rapidly GPS denial and spoofing tactics are evolving.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 8, 2020",Boeing Conducts Flight Test Of Surrogate Drones For Australia’s Loyal Wingman Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing says that its Australian subsidiary has used systems developed in that country to enable a pair of unmanned, subscale, jet-powered test aircraft to conduct a semi-autonomous teamed flight for the very first time. This is part of the development of the Airpower Teaming System for the Royal Australian Air Force, which centered around a stealthy “loyal wingman” drone intended to work together with that service’s manned platforms, including its F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . Boeing Australia announced the successful test, and released an accompanying video, on social media on Nov. 19, 2019. The Chicago-headquartered plane maker had officially unveiled the Airpower Teaming System (ATS) effort at the Avalon Air Show in Australia on Feb. 27, but the news had already emerged, including on The War Zone , the day before. Boeing is under contract to build an initial demonstrator as part of the previously classified Loyal Wingman Advanced Development Program, which dates back at least to 2018 . The Australian government expects to spend $28.5 million on the project over the next four years and Boeing is also helping with funding the work on the demonstrator through a separate agreement to invest around $42 million, in total, on various research and development programs in Australia. “We successfully achieved our first autonomous teamed flights using high-performance jets as test beds and Australian-developed missions systems technology!” Boeing’s announcement on Facebook said. “Our team tested the jets’ abilities to safely communicate and coordinate with each other.” The two jet-powered drones reportedly flew at speeds up to around 186 miles per hour during the test flight. Boeing did not elaborate on any of the specific test points, but did add “next, we’ll try more complex maneuvers, increasing teaming formation numbers and more complex missions.” We do know that the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) goal is for the final ATS combat drones to be able to operate independently or in concert with manned platforms, using a new control architecture to autonomously maintain formation with other aircraft and perform various tasks. The technology that Boeing is testing now with these subscale drones aligns well with that plan. It also makes perfect sense to be developing this control architecture now so that it is as mature as possible when the demonstrator is ready to fly. In February, Boeing said that this prototype was already under construction and was scheduled to have its first flight next year, according to Aviation Week . An artist’s conception of the ATS unmanned aircraft., Boeing via ABC The company’s plan is to “fly, test and fail . . . and get this exciting kind of quick learning” using the ATS demonstrator, Shane Arnott, head of Boeing’s Phantom Works International, told Aviation Week . “That becomes a real advantage for us to go fast and get to trust the product quicker, which is what autonomy is all about.” “This is an innovation program for the RAAF. It is not a capability delivery,” he continued, explaining that it would offer Australia an opportunity to further explore manned-unmanned teaming concepts of operation, broadly. “This is an opportunity for them to try before they buy, but do it in a meaningful way.” The RAAF already expects the 38-foot-long ATS loyal wingmen, which will use a bizjet-class jet engine and have a range of around 2,000 nautical miles, to eventually be able to perform a wide variety of missions working together with various manned aircraft. This includes fighters such as its F-35As and F/A-18E/F Super Hornets , as well as its EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control platforms, and P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes. With the exception of the F-35A, these are all notably Boeing products, too. BREAKING NEWS: Check out our new smart, reconfigurable unmanned aircraft that will protect & project airpower! #TheFutureIsBuiltHere #AirpowerTeaming Read more about the Boeing Airpower Teaming System: https://t.co/Gabz4x9oBv pic.twitter.com/K1Nnvc0jl6 — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) February 26, 2019 The unmanned aircraft will have a modular design with the ability to accommodate “snap-on, snap-off” payloads to rapidly reconfigure them for different missions, according to Aviation Week . Initially, this could include various sensor packages or electronic warfare systems. Exactly how much autonomy the drones might have would “depend on what the system is paired with, what it does, what the effect is, and who does what in the teaming system,” Kristin Robertson, the Vice President and General Manager of Boeing Autonomous Systems, had also told Aviation Week in February. “Somewhere in the equation there will be a man in the loop, from a ground station or controlled from commercial derivatives or fighters. I would characterize the autonomy as actionable intelligence.” For Australia, this could offer a major boost in capability at a relatively low cost and without the time and expense required to train traditional pilots. Tethered to manned aircraft via datalink, the ATS drones could provide the pilots of manned aircraft with a more comprehensive picture of the battlespace around them and help them detect threats faster in order to avoid or neutralize them. Combined with the drone’s stealthy design, this could be particularly valuable for helping to further reduce the risks to higher cost assets, such as the F-35, when penetrating deep into heavily defended areas. The modular nature of the design also supports the goal of the rapid integration of new capabilities and payloads with minimal cost and effort. As time goes on, armed versions of the ATS unmanned aircraft could help increase the magazine capacity, sensor diversity, and more of a mixed manned-unmanned force, or even just operate as autonomous swarms. Really, this is a low-risk way for the RAAF to explore semi-autonomous concept of operations, in general. ATS may turn out to have limited potential, but it is extremely cost-effective and could serve as a valuable stepping stone to future unmanned developments. We also don’t know the origins of the lower-end surrogates that Boeing used in this particular test, but they are intriguing in their own right. They could be scaled into larger formations and swarms for further testing even beyond the Airpower Teaming System program. One of the two surrogates that Boeing used in the recent autonomous teaming test flight., Boeing capture This is all in line with a broader concept, called Plan Jericho, which the RAAF is implementing across the force. This is focused on leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, unmanned platforms, and other high technology endeavors to find ways to expand capabilities within the limits of the country’s relatively overall small force structure. Other countries are increasingly thinking along similar lines and the number of programs concerned with developing loyal wingman -type unmanned aircraft around the world is growing. With this in mind, Boeing is already eying pitching variants or derivatives of the ATS concept to other similarly sized militaries. The company says it will be able to craft and scale the exact capabilities of the unmanned aircraft to meet the demands of potential customers, according to Aviation Week . “Allies around the world are looking for ways to maximize and extend their [force] structures,” Robertson added in her interview with Aviation Week . “Autonomous systems and some of the technologies behind them can make more of a game-changing leap in affordability and quantity, to complement their existing fleets.” The autonomous teamed flight test shows that Boeing is already making important progress in software that will form the backbone of the ATS effort and that its team in Australia isn’t even waiting for the demonstrator to be ready to start showing off what the complete system may be capable of in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 17, 2019",New Video Offers Sweeping Views Of Secretive Tonopah Air Base,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Next to Area 51 , Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR) is probably the most famous secretive aircraft operating location in the United States. As such, regardless of its remote locale, situated about 27 miles southeast of the small Nevada town that shares its name, literally in the middle of nowhere, the base draws attention due to its historic significance and speculation as to what is going on there today. One such interested party is YouTuber TheArea51Rider who scooted up nearby Brainwash Butte, located roughly a dozen miles to the east of TTR, to shoot some telephoto video of the sprawling base. The video would not embed, but you can watch it directly on YouTube by clicking here . TTR is where the F-117 Nighthawk sharpened its talons under extreme secrecy in the 1980s and it houses the largely mothballed fleet today, although a handful of Nighthawks are still flying— a story we have covered extensively over the years . The base is also where Russian fighters were being flown clandestinely for testing and against Allied fighter pilots during the last act of the Cold War. More recently, like the F-117 before it, the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth reconnaissance drone evolved into an operational state at Tonopah Test Range Airport. Beyond supporting nearby range operations that focus heavily on nuclear weapons delivery systems development and validation, TTR houses foreign ground vehicles used as threat emulators for large exercises like Red Flag. Beyond that, and a lingering presence of the RQ-170 Sentinel and F-117 Nighthawk, its other duties remain undisclosed. It’s clear that the special operations community uses the base for training and testing initiatives and it would be the perfect home of some additional stealth transport helicopters if follow-on variants were indeed procured after the Bin Laden raid in 2011 as it has been reported. It would also be the ideal home of a pocket, semi-operational, advanced unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) program that very likely, or at least should, exist. You can read all about this peculiar reality here. Indeed, unidentified aircraft do call the base home. Edited satellite images of one such aircraft appeared on Google Earth not long ago as The War Zone exclusively reported on . In more recent satellite imagery that The War Zone has reviewed, the northern end of the base’s long ramp and hangar “canyons” has become especially active, with groups of three or four small tactical-sized craft using the ramp regularly. Gatherings of testbed aircraft, such as the NT-43A “Ratt55,” Boeing’s F-22 “Catfish” 757 testbed , and others showing up there no doubt as part of signature measurement, subsystems development, and tactics validation initiatives. At other times, a number of smaller CN-235 transports , along with larger ones, like C-17s are seen present together between the final stretches of hangars to the north. So, clearly, there are many programs underway inside the 54 hangars on the base, not counting the larger sequestered ones to the south. The F-117s are packed five to a hangar for storage, with a handful of others being in flying condition and occupying their own hangars. This makes up just a fraction of the hangar space that is present on the base, almost all of which was originally built to host the F-117 force. In the YouTube video, which was shot in June, a peculiarly shaped aircraft-looking object is seen in front of one of the hangars. As usual with TTR viewing from afar, it is unclear exactly what aircraft this could be, but an F-117 is very possible. In fact, the F-117 that was just delivered to Reagan Library , nicknamed “Unexpected Guest,” already had been partially disassembled by July, so its light color could have been a result of media blasting all its sensitive and highly toxic coatings away before being trucked to Palmdale for full demilitarization and restoration. A facility capable of stripping the F-117s clean has been specially built on the base. Still, there are plenty of other possible explanations. As for the state of the air base itself, there were growing rumors over the last year that major expansion projects were underway due to large amounts of gravel being trucked into the base, including a runway extension and possibly new hangar and support facilities. We can unequivocally state that is not the case. Satellite imagery shows normal refurbishment of sections of the base’s long runway and the uniquely fenced-off taxiways that straddle it. The only addition is a small turn out area along the north taxiway that is probably also used for engine test runs. Beyond that, the air-side of the base is largely the same as it has been in years past. What do you see in the video? Let us know in the comments below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 27, 2019",Russia Says UAE Could Help Build Su-57s As Gulf Nation Puts F-35 Ambitions On Hold,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says that it is offering opportunities to produce certain components for the Su-57 as part of potential sales of the advanced combat jets to the United Arab Emirates, as well as India and Turkey . This comes just days after the U.S. government made clear that it was not engaged in any active discussions with the UAE about selling that country the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, despite reports of significant progress on that prospective deal two years ago. Sergey Chemezov, in charge of Russia’s main state-owned industrial conglomerate Rostec, talked about the possibility of “localization” of portions of the Su-57 supply chain within other countries that decide to buy those jets on the sidelines of the biennial Dubai Air Show in the UAE on Nov. 18, 2019. The development of this advanced combat jet, which now reportedly has the NATO nickname Felon , has been a saga unto itself, as you can read in these past War Zone pieces . In May 2018, the Kremlin announced that it planned to buy 76 Su-57s through 2028 and TV Zvezda , the official television channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense, released video of the first serial production aircraft under construction earlier this month. Russia has also been actively courting prospective customers for any future export variant in recent months. “Su-57 – India, most probably Emirates. They have been considering and discussing it [buying these aircraft] for a long time, though no decision has been delivered yet,” Chemezov told reporters. “Localization [has been offered] … It does not matter whether it is [the] United Arab Emirates, India or Turkey, we will rely on what they can do.” Chemezov elaborated that the last point meant that Russia would seek to offer industrial cooperation opportunities that align with the capabilities of the defense industrial base of the customer in question. He added that if the buyer did not have an existing or potential ability to produce relevant components itself, that Russia would not assist in the establishment of those supply chains and that “it simply means that it [localization] does not work” in that case. The offer is still clearly meant to sweeten the deal for prospective customers. Chemezov’s decision to name the UAE specifically is also notable given that in 2017 it had appeared that the country was making real progress in negotiations with the United States about acquiring the F-35. Reports that year indicated that such discussions were advanced enough that Gulf nation was looking at potential initial order of 24 Joint Strike Fighters. “There have not been any classified briefings [with the UAE on the F-35]. There will not be any discussions [on the F-35] this week,” Ellen Lord, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, told reporters on Nov. 16, 2019, according to Defense News . “We do not have ongoing with the Emiratis right now. We are, within the U.S., discussing how we might end up in those.” On Nov. 18, Defense News’ Valerie Insinna Tweeted out that Clarke Cooper, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, had reiterated “that there are no ongoing discussions with the UAE on the F-35.” Under Secretary of Defense Lord had also said that the focus with regards to the UAE had shifted to discussions about modernizing its already advanced fleet of F-16E/F Desert Falcon fighter jets, aircraft that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . Just a few minutes ago, Clarke Cooper, who heads @StateDeptPM , repeated that there are no ongoing discussions with the UAE on the F-35. Read my story from this weekend here, ICYMI: https://t.co/FfJWZVvKgR — Valerie Insinna (@ValerieInsinna) November 18, 2019 Lord did not elaborate on the reasons why the UAE had apparently moved away from its years-long push to acquire the F-35 or whether that decision originated with that country or the United States, or both parties mutually. Past reports often cited general security concerns about the export of the Joint Strike Fighters to the UAE, as well as the potential risks they might pose to Israel’s regional military edge, as reasons why the U.S. government was reticent to approve such a deal. However, the Joint Strike Fighter, with its integral back-end cloud-based network , which is essential for key operational and sustainment tasks, offered an unprecedented potential export control mechanism, as The War Zone explored in detail back in 2017. The ability to remotely cut off vital software updates and network access, and perhaps even disable it entirely, could have helped assuage U.S. and Israeli fears to some degree. Beyond that, the UAE and Israel have found increasingly common ground over shared concerns about Iran and its malign activities in the region. It’s also not clear whether a major spat between the United States and Turkey over the latter country’s purchase of the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system played any part in this movement away from work on a prospective UAE F-35 deal. The U.S. government ejected Turkey from the Joint Strike Fighter program earlier this year and the Turkish defense industry is on track to lose billions of dollars worth of related contracts. The Turkish government is now at risk of further sanctions , as well. The first F-35A intended for Turkey at a rollout ceremony in 2018. The U.S. government has now removed Turkey from the Joint Strike Fighter program., Anadolu Agency It’s not hard to see how the UAE might not have been thrilled about subjecting itself to such significant restrictions, not to mention the additional potential hurdles of Lockheed Martin retaining its own extensive control over the operational and sustainment of the aircraft, intellectual property rights issues that even the U.S. military and its NATO allies have chafed at. That the jets could have second-order impacts on other defense procurement decisions, as Turkey has found with the S-400, and open up new risks for automatic sanctions may not have been appealing, either. The Su-57 is certainly not equivalent to the F-35, but it does have a number of interesting and unique features that make it a very capable design if everything works as it’s supposed to. You can read more about these capabilities in detail in this past War Zone feature . Whatever the case, Russia is clearly aware of the UAE’s decision to back away from an F-35 purchase plan, at least for the time being, and it’s not surprising that the Kremlin is already presenting itself as an alternative. Prior to 2017, there had already been regular reports that the Russians were working on a deal to sell Su-35 Flanker-E fourth-generation fighters to the UAE, though some had speculated this was part of an effort to pressure the United States into selling the Joint Strike Fighter. Russia’s messaging to the UAE seems very similar to what it has done with regards to Turkey following the S-400 sale. Moscow now says a potential sale of fourth-generation Su-35s to Ankara is in the works and Chemezov has previously proposed a sale of Su-57s for the Turkish Air Force. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offhandedly indicated interest in earlier this year. The “localization” offer could make such a future deal more appealing for Turkey, especially given the loss of F-35-related contracts. Beyond all this, Chemezov’s comments make clear that Russia is still very eager to find foreign partners to help spread out the cost burden of the Su-57 program. There have been persistent questions about whether or not the Kremlin will be able to afford its own purchases of the jets, as well as the development of new, more powerful engines for them, amid contracting defense budgets, the result of international sanctions and other economic issues . A partner that agrees to make a substantial purchase of the jets could drive down unit costs for Russia, as well, and help underwrite the development of future upgrades and new weapons . India, the other country he mentioned by name, had long been involved in the development of the Su-57 with the potential for local assembly and other industrial cooperation opportunities being part of that deal. However, the Indian government reportedly ended cooperation on the advanced combat jet in 2018, though Russia has been trying to bring them back into the program . India has made significant industrial cooperation a core part of the latest iteration of its effort procure more than 100 advanced fourth-generation fighter jets and has also said that it will expect the winner of that tender to help support work on its own indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter. India is also notably buying S-400s, which may close off its path to the F-35 for the foreseeable future and could put it in danger of getting hit with U.S. sanctions. Still, many experts believe that it will receive a waiver for certain sanctions from the U.S. government, which has been keen to increase military and economic cooperation with the world’s largest democracy in recent years. A now extremely dated infographic from the Su-57’s manufacturer Sukhoi detailing early plans for variants of what was then known as the T-50 or PAK FA, including potential versions for India, Iran, and South Korea., Sukhoi Russia has also reportedly approached China about joining the Su-57 effort, though it is less clear how interested that country might be given that it has already fielded one stealth fighter, the J-20 , and is developing another, the FC-31 . This is not to mention the significant resources the Chinese have been investing in stealthy unmanned combat air vehicles. That being said, China may be looking to buy more Russian Su-35s , despite making its own Flanker derivatives domestically, and could see the potential for some useful technology transfer as part of Chemezov’s “localization” offer. It remains to be seen if the UAE – or Turkey, India, China, or any other country – actually moves to purchase Su-57s, with or without the promise of getting additional industrial cooperation deals. What is clear is that Russians are looking for additional prospective customers for these advanced combat jets and are looking to find ways to make the pitch more enticing.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 28, 2022",The Mandalorian Is The Star Wars You’ve Been Looking For,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is no doubt that the Star Wars franchise is one of the strongest on our own outer rim planet, but there have been signs that some of its luster may be fading. With potential storm clouds hanging over Disney’s banner sci-fi investment, all eyes on are the franchise’s first live-action Star Wars television show, The Mandalorian . In an era where the real possibility of “Star Wars fatigue” seems to be a potential symptom of a greater ailment within the House of Mouse, and in which the company has so much riding on its new streaming service, Disney+, of which The Madolorian is the ‘E-ticket ride,’ the stakes really couldn’t be higher for the Jon Favreau-helmed space adventure series. So, with two episodes of The Mandalorian streaming away, what’s the verdict? I can confidently say that this is the Star Wars you’ve been looking for. Author’s note: There are no major spoilers in this review! I wanted to talk about the show’s broader strokes and bigger implications, so read ahead even if you haven’t seen it yet, you won’t be harmed! Everything that the J.J. Abrams-era sequels have lacked is omnipresent in The Mandalorian . Let me rephrase that—this show wipes the floor with the new movies. It is not another ‘as massive a market as possible’ Star Wars adaptation. It doesn’t have a rushed, over-stuffed, and often nonsensical storyline that relies more on the public’s demand for anything new Star Wars than actual quality or even coherent storytelling. As a result, it can take chances. It can be remarkably violent when it needs to be. Above all else, it can take its time to bathe in a key ingredient that makes Star Wars so great—the incredibly diverse and texture-heavy environments that make up a galaxy far, far away. And yes, the show is gorgeous. The production values are right up there with the films and in some ways seem to exceed them. Pedro Pascal playing the helmet-clad bounty hunter of remarkably few words works great too. The concept puts a lot of weight on his voice acting, which doesn’t disappoint, and allows viewers to focus their attention elsewhere more frequently from scene to scene. All this contributes to an amazing world-building opportunity, which the show is capitalizing on in spades even this early on in its run. So many Easter eggs and connections to all aspects of Star Wars canon are packed into two episodes that it is abundantly clear that the showrunners have no intent to dumb things down for the casual viewer. In fact, if anything else, this is a super fan’s show and that is really exciting because, hopefully, it won’t be afraid to tell a story that connects back with Star Wars past and future in creative ways as it is set in between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens . That would be different than most movie franchise television adaptations, where they were more of a ‘ship in a bottle,’ not allowed to have major consequences on the high-grossing movie side of the portfolio. Many reviews are declaring that The Mandalorian proves Star Wars works for television. This is entirely untrue . Star Wars has worked for television for over a decade. The Clone Wars , a cartoon that aired on the Disney Channel, is the best and most in-depth Star Wars storytelling I have seen. It was able to write vast amounts of Star Wars canon and it actually made the George Lucas’s often maligned prequels far better retroactively. New characters that eclipse nearly anything J.J. Abrams has brought forward in terms of depth and likeability originated from this show. The series was a war saga that was heavy in politics, and at times seemed out of place on a children’s network for all the right reasons. Then came Rebels , which built upon The Clone Wars with a story of a bit smaller scope , and did some amazing things while still being a children’s show. The live-action Mandalorian has been able to do what always needed to be done, to take a blaster to the confines of ‘children’s entertainment’ and use the same awesome storytelling abilities for a more mature audience. Disney It just so happens the guy behind both of those animated series, Dave Feloni, is an executive producer on The Mandalorian and directed the first episode. The George Lucas apprentice became the ‘Chosen One’ to carry the Star Wars brand forward for throngs of Star Wars fans long ago, but because he was relegated to the child’s cartoon medium, he seemed to get passed over for less invested and knowledgeable, but more prominent behind-the-camera talent. Now that has changed and there is no going back. Finally, Feloni has been given a mature medium to showcase his amazing talents and, as a result, I believe he will officially become the mind behind Star Wars for years to come. At least I can only hope so. As for the nuts and bolts of the show itself, it’s relatively genius. The whole bounty hunter series idea has always been a thing, but Favreau read the landscape perfectly and basically ported over the western/samurai genre directly to the Star Wars universe. It works so well that I found myself watching and thinking, ‘man this really works!’ The series is setting itself up already to become something of an iteration on Ogami Ittō’s Lone Wolf And Cub , the iconic Japanese manga from the 1970s that turned into a series of films that defined a genre. In more recent times, the John Wick franchise has reached new heights of success by reframing the western or samurai revenge genre for a modern era. I did a separate review that talks all about this, that you can read here . And yes, Mandalorian is John Wick with hyperdrives to some degree, but that is not a bad thing. Quite the contrary actually. Large swathes of the Star Wars universe has been built up around the bounty hunter mystique. Developing it into its own property is quite literally a long time coming. Pairing it more deeply with the western/samurai genre is logical for obvious reasons, so it’s not just a convenient derivative, it just happens to be a hot genre right now. Disney Like John Wick , The Mandalorian is already hard at work building out the colorful underbelly subculture of bounty hunters and assassins in the Star Wars universe. Also like John Wick , the set-piece fight sequences take center stage and they are remarkably violent for Star Wars, giving the series a far more edgy and unpredictable feel. All this comes together to do something that has seemed elusive to many Star Wars fans since The Force Awakens hit theaters, it makes the post- Return Of The Jedi world that has been built in an endless stream of books and comics, as well as the two sequel films, actually interesting. Clearly, the fall of the empire was welcome to many, but there are always winners and losers in such a grand scheme, and the vacuum of order, regardless of its intentions, is still a vacuum that invites chaos and nefarious acts. Like the wild west, the reality that the The Mandalorian inhabits, even earlier on in its first season, really does feels lawless and uncertain. I also have a feeling that some of our old friends from Feloni’s beloved cartoons will show up in live-action form. Rebel’s set up this possibility rather brilliantly. One character that spans both The Clone Wars and Rebels , Ashoka Tano, could very well make a cameo, which would be a huge win for diehard fans and doing so would introduce likely the most beloved character of the animated Star Wars realm into the live-action environment. Another Mandalorian that was a key character in Rebels has a high chance of appearing, as well. It’s important to remember that The Mandalorian is really a pilot for a whole new Star Wars television ecosystem that is slated to roll out in the not so distant future. We know for sure that a Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna as Cassian Andor is in development, as is the Obi Wan Kenobi series with Ewan McGregor, but that could just be the tip of the iceberg depending on how valuable The Mandalorian proves to be. Considering Disney will know exactly what gets watched and by who on its streaming service, the areas where more dollars will flow content-wise will be crystal clear as time goes on. The Mandalorian is truly gorgeous. The production values are right there with the movies, if not better. , Disney And dollars flowing into Disney’s war chest is what this is all about. I have heard over and over again that Disney CEO Bob Iger’s legacy rests on the success or failure of Disney+. If that is even somewhat the case, you can imagine how much focus this new platform is garnering across Disney’s core business units. It could redefine a very significant portion of the company’s revenue model and thus how it manages its intellectual property, which impacts everything from merchandise sales to theme park attendance downstream. With this in mind, in some ways, Disney is along for the ride with us when it comes to The Mandalorian . So far that ride has been a thrill in all the right ways. If it sticks the landing at the end of its eight-episode run, the future of Star Wars on the small screen could eclipse that of the big screen. I, for one, am totally fine with that.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 16, 2019",Kim Jong Un Oversees Huge Gathering Of His Country’s Antiquated Air Combat Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the prospects of an ongoing dialogue with the U.S. over its ever-growing nuclear and missile programs continue to decline, Kim Jong Un visited North Korea’s Wonsan-Kalma International Airport to oversee what appears to be an unprecedented, at least in recent years, gathering of North Korean air power. Satellite images from November 11th showed a very large number of aircraft at the airfield, which pointed to some sort of high-profile event being imminent. 38North.org , which closely tracks activities in the Hermit Kingdom, reported the following on November 14th: On imagery from November 11, there were four MiG-17 fighter aircraft, six MiG-15 fighter aircraft, fourteen Su-25 close support aircraft, six MiG-29 fighter aircraft and six Il-28 bomber aircraft observed on the tarmac north of the passenger terminal. On November 13, additional MiG-15 and MiG-17 were added to the display bringing their total to eleven MiG-15s and eight MiG-17s. Several small vehicles were parked on the tarmac near the MiG-29 and Il-28 aircraft. In addition, thirteen probable MiG-21 fighter aircraft were observed on the alert apron at the south end of the airfield, and six small, either Hughes 500 or Mi-2 Hoplite light helicopters, six medium, possibly Mi-8 or Mi-14, medium transport helicopters, and eight An-2 Colt light transport aircraft were parked along the auxiliary runway located on the southwest side of the airfield. Further to the south of the auxiliary runway at the rail transfer point, seven additional MiG-21 were parked on an adjacent apron. It could not be determined whether these aircraft are newly arrived, perhaps by rail, or whether they have been moved there for temporary storage. An official state media press release following the event—translated into English—and posted by KCNAwatch.com states: Pyongyang, November 16 (KCNA) — Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and supreme commander of the armed forces of the DPRK, watched “the combat flight contest-2019 of the flight commanding officers of the Air and Anti-Aircraft Force of the Korean People’s Army.” When Supreme Leader of the Party, state and armed forces Kim Jong Un came to Wonsan Kalma Airport, the venue, all the participants and the spectators broke into thunderous cheers of “hurrah!” The commander of the Air and Anti-Aircraft Force of the KPA made an opening speech. The contest, being divided into division commander group, pursuit plane regiment commander group and light plane regiment commander group, were held by way of letting all the aircrafts equipped with maximum armament conduct bombing flight and firing flight under the command of the formation flight by the flight commanding officers. The flight commanding officers and the combat pilots fully demonstrated the invincible might of Kim Jong Un’s flying corps by displaying the aviation they have trained during the ordinary days. Whenever the flight commanding officers and the combat pilots showed admirable aviation with brave and flexible art of control, the Supreme Leader warmly acknowledged them, giving encouragement. He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the flight commanding officers and combat pilots took an active part in the contest and held enthusiastic contest, showing high aviation. Our pilots have to try to fight the enemies armed to the teeth with great idea and tactics under any circumstances, the Supreme Leader said, adding that the result of the fight is not decided by the combat specification of arms and equipment but by for what and with what idea the fight is fought. He stressed that however loudly the enemies may brag about their technological advantages, they can never overwhelm the politico-ideological and combat and moral advantages of our service personnel. The Supreme Leader underscored the need for all the pilots to get fully versed in the Juche-based air tactics and be fully ready for effectively applying them to operations and battles, adding that it is important for all the pilots to possess high level of aviation, bombing skill and marksmanship by systematically conducting flight drills on a normal basis under the simulated conditions of an actual war in the severest condition. He indicated the orientation as regards the development of the air force weaponry of our own style to contain the armed forces of the enemy boasting of the technical advantages of their aircrafts, giving vital instructions in developing the Juche-based air force. He congratulated the flight commanding officers who took part in the contest on their successes and had a photo session with them. Among the spectators were leading officials of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. It isn’t clear if any live-fire actually happened as the base is not a bombing range, but it is possible it did occur at a remote site. Up until 2016, the Korean People’s Army Air and Anti-Air Force Flight Drill Competition, a live-fire exercise , used to be the most prominent display of North Korea’s antiquated air combat capabilities, but that high-profile drill has not occurred since. Sanctions, including those that have curtailed the country’s fuel supplies significantly, are thought to have contributed to sidelining that exercise. Still, Kim’s well-established love affair with aviation has prompted other major aviation events, some of them quite peculiar, like the international air show Pyongyang put on in 2016. With this in mind, the reemergence of such a gathering, even if it was curtailed in scope, can be viewed as yet another act of defiance by Kim in the face of international sanctions. Photos from the event are limited, with most showing Kim going about his visit as we have seen time and again, with arrival, commanding shots behind a desk, and photos with the rank and file. But one photo does show the rickety VIP configured IL-62M, “Kim Force One,” doing a flyby flanked by no less than six MiG-29 Fulcrums. That is the most of the type, which are largely relegated to guarding Pyongyang , I have seen in the air together in many years. Three more MiG-29s are sitting on the ground in the image, as well. It is thought that North Korea has around 35 MiG-29s, which were acquired in the 1990s, although how many are airworthy at any given time is certainly just a fraction of that number. NK State Media Regardless of any “juche-based tactics,” the North Korean Air Force stands zero chance at surviving even a very short period of time against a modern air combat force, like that of the U.S. or South Korea. In fact, it’s most lowly and diminutive types pose more of an actual threat to South Korea than its fighters and attack jets. Kim isn’t delusional regarding this, but North Korea’s air force acts as a powerful propaganda tool and events like this are more about projecting a measure of power and keeping the military itself satisfied than about honing relevant combat skills. NK State Media NK State Media NK State Media North Korea’s weak and antiquated air arm is another reason why Kim’s investment in the country’s nuclear program has been so extreme. As North Korea’s conventional capabilities continue to atrophy, its nuclear one becomes all that much more critical. Just as North Korea’s own air exercises were wrapping up, one of Kim’s top cronies and the man who had led talks with the U.S., Kim Yong Chol, warned that there would be “shocking punishment” if the U.S. proceeds as planned with its own upcoming wargames with South Korea. The hypocrisy of such an assertion would only be true if the North’s recent air excercise was anything but a token drill that served more as a propaganda setpiece and for the personal enjoyment of the “Young General” than anything else.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 30, 2020",Watch Russian Submariners Train To Escape A Burning Submarine Through A Torpedo Tube,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The official television channel of Russia’s Ministry of Defense recently offered a look at an emergency drill onboard the Project 949A Oscar II class nuclear-powered guided-missile submarine Tver. It begins with personnel responding to a potential blaze onboard and ends with a sailor practicing how to escape through a torpedo tube using a special suit. These types of drills are routine and hardly surprising given the particular danger that fires pose to subs, which the War Zone has previously explored in-depth. Still, there is no doubt that there is some added emphasis within the Russian Navy on this kind of preparedness following the fire onboard the spy submarine Losharik earlier this year that killed 14 sailors. TV Zvezda posted the brief segment online on Nov. 14, 2019. We don’t know when the drill occurred, but it took place in the frigid waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia’s Far East region. Tver , which is assigned to the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet , is homeported at the Rybachiy Nuclear Submarine Base in Kamchatka. The video shows personnel racing to seal a compartment and otherwise battle the fire after the drill begins. They can be seen carrying small, portable emergency breathing devices in cases slung around their necks. These systems typically feature a self-contained oxygen supply and some form of hood to protect the wearer from smoke. They are generally intended for short-duration use only to allow individuals to escape to a safe area. It’s not stated in the TV Zvezda clip, but these may be PDU-3s, which provide enough oxygen for the user to breath for around 20 minutes, depending on how active they are and other factors. During the fire aboard Losharik in July 2019, which you can read about in much greater detail in this past War Zone piece , personnel reportedly used these emergency breathing systems, as well as a fixed emergency breathing apparatus, as they fought the blaze. Working fast to contain a fire onboard a submarine to as few compartments as possible and get it otherwise under control is of paramount importance. As The War Zone has already explored in the past, fires within submarines are relatively unique given the confined environment that gives the heat and smoke no way to escape and dissipate. This, in turn, significantly increases the risks of smoke-related injuries because of how quickly it builds up inside the submarine’s small compartments. However, sealing off compartments can also leave sailors stranded at other ends of the submarine, without an easy means of getting out of the submarine to safety. Many classes of Russian submarines have special escape pods built into their sails, but it might be difficult for submariners to get to them if they’re stranded at one end of the boat or another with a fire between them and this method of egress. The escape pod on the Russian Project 945 Sierra class nuclear attack submarine Kostroma removed during maintenance., Russian Internet So, the drill onboard Tver also involved multiple individuals donning special emergency suits and exiting through the torpedo tubes at the front of the submarine. Rather than traditional diving gear, these suits only have a limited amount of oxygen to enable the individual to get to the surface, and hopefully to waiting rescuers. In the case of this drill, a Russian Navy support boat was sitting on the surface waiting for them, which was no doubt welcome given that it is winter in Kamchatka and forecasts show that the ambient temperatures during the day remain firmly below freezing. As a result, water temperatures are generally very cold and this drill also occurred at night. A picture of Tver in the ice-filled waters of the Rybachiy Nuclear Submarine Base, giving a sense of how cold things can get in Kamchatka., Russian Ministry of Defense TV Zvezda also said that the suits are available for sailors evacuating subs that have sunken to the bottom of the ocean. This is what infamously happened to the Kursk , another Oscar II class submarine, following a torpedo explosion in 2000. Of the submarine’s crew of 118, approximately 23 survived the initial mishap, but were unable to escape and died later. The escape suits are not a perfect solution, of course, and it’s not clear what the maximum safe depth for using them might be. Still, they do offer another way to try to get to safety depending on the exact circumstances and it is better to have that option than not. This incident with Losharik earlier this year only underscores the importance of having emergency systems like the breathing devices and escape suits, as well as the value of regular training to ensure that submariners know how to use them, if necessary. Beyond that mishap, and the Kursk disaster , Russia, and the Soviet Union before it, is hardly a stranger to submarine accidents, in general, too. The one-of-kind Project 685 nuclear-powered attack submarine K-278 Komsomolets is presently leaking radiation on the bottom of the Barents Sea, where it has been sitting since it sunk following a fire in 1989. Five sailors attempted to use the submarine’s escape pod, but it malfunctioned and only one who had also been wearing a breathing device survived. Right before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine TK-17 almost sank after an R-39 Rif submarine launched-ballistic missile exploded in its launch tube during an exercise. In 2008, a fire suppression system on the Project 971 Akula -class nuclear attack submarine Nerpa , meant to quickly suffocate fires with inert gas, inadvertently went off, killing 20 sailors and injuring 41 more. These are only some of the submarine accidents that Russia has suffered and, in recent years, there have been a number of serious fires involving sub simply undergoing maintenance or otherwise in port . Escaping a burning submarine in a cumbersome suit through a torpedo tube certainly isn’t for the faint of heart, but having as many options as possible to get out alive is surely welcome.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 4, 2020",USAF May Launch New Light Attack Aircraft Tests To Explore A Requirement It Already Has,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force says that its dramatically curtailed light attack aircraft program may now evolve to include a series of experiments to explore the possibility of using those same planes to perform armed overwatch missions. The issue here is that the service said that its last round of light attack-related testing included evaluating the use of these planes in this exact same role, something that has otherwise been a well-established requirement for this type of platform. This is the latest example of the service insisting on conducting yet more light attack-related studies and tests despite having at least a decade of hard data and in the face of the glaringly obvious demand for this capability, especially from U.S. special operations forces. Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said that American special operators had been particularly vocal about their interest in a light attack aircraft that could also work in the armed overwatch role, which the Air Force also refers to as armed reconnaissance, during a discussion at a Defense Writers Group breakfast in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 12, 2019. U.S. Army General Richard Clarke, presently head of U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), had publicly expressed his support for buying and fielding light attack aircraft while testifying before members of Congress in May. The Air Force’s latest foray in acquiring this kind of capability, most recently referred to as the Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) program, began in 2017, but, traces its roots back to at least 2008, as you can learn about in greater detail in this past War Zone piece . “My caution in the future would be to take a scientist’s view, which is, discovery tends to lead to better questions,” Roper said on Nov. 12. “I think that’s likely what you’ll see from light attack, are kind of two prongs. Whether we call the armed overwatch ‘light attack’ – probably not, because it’s not light attack – but we’ve learned the operators’ need for it, based on this experimentation.” The other prong that Roper was referring to is the Air Force’s existing plan to purchase up to three of both the A-29 Super Tucano from Embraer and the Sierra Nevada Corporation and the AT-6C Wolverine from Textron. The service originally announced it would buy between two and three of each aircraft in March. Since then, it has quietly changed the wording its contracting notices to say that it might actually only purchase one of each type in the end. As it stands now, Air Combat Command (ACC) will take delivery of the AT-6Cs to support testing and development of low-cost, exportable data-sharing architecture, called AEROnet , which could help enable allies and partners to better communicate and exchange information during coalition operations. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will receive the A-29s and use them to craft a curriculum for training Combat Aviation Advisors to be better able to help train and advise foreign partners flying these and other similar aircraft. Neither plan shows a path to acquiring light attack aircraft for regular or special operations Air Force units to employ operationally themselves as General Clarke and others have called for. That would be galling enough without Roper now talking about the possibility of additional testing around the armed overwatch mission. This role involves an aircraft orbiting over a portion of the battlefield monitoring for enemy movements and then being then on station to engage targets of opportunity that might threaten ongoing operations down below. Unmanned aircraft, such as the Air Force’s MQ-9 Reaper and the Army’s MQ-1C Gray Eagle often provide this type of coverage. Combat jets, such as F-16C/D Vipers and F-15E Strike Eagles, as well as B-1 and B-52 bombers and AC-130 gunships , among many others, have also been called upon to fly these missions for both regular and special operations forces. Aircraft such as the A-29 and the AT-6C would certainly be well suited to this mission set. Being more flexible and having a smaller logistical footprint than combat jets or bombers, these planes could fly from more austere forward operating locations to provide a persistent presence and do so at low cost, something The War Zone has highlighted repeatedly over the years . If it seems like an obvious role for these planes to an outside observer, it certainly is to the Air Force itself. The OA-X Enabling Concept , which personnel at Air Combat Command drafted in 2008 and is treated as a foundational text for the service’s more recent light attack programs, specifically mentions armed overwatch as a potential mission for this type of aircraft. USAF This directly informed the Air Force’s abortive Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance (LAAR) program – armed reconnaissance being right there in the name – which the service finally cancelled for good in 2012. A related effort, the Light Air Support (LAS) program, created a pipeline for acquiring A-29s for Afghanistan and established an Air Force unit, the 81st Fighter Squadron , to train that country’s pilots to fly them, including on armed overwatch missions. LAS’s objectives and the 81st’s mission have since expanded to include similar A-29-related support to Lebanon and other countries . It was also a component of SOCOM’s subsequent Combat Dragon II light attack aircraft experiment, which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone piece . After various experiments and exercises, Combat Dragon II culminated with the deployment of a pair of modified OV-10G+ Broncos to Iraq to actually evaluate various concepts of operation in a real combat environment. The aircraft and their crews performed magnificently. A slide from a briefing about the Combat Dragon II effort showing various objectives of the experiments, including demonstrating tactical reconnaissance and related capabilities., SOCOM via FOIA Beyond the fact that armed overwatch has been a core component of discussions surrounding the Air Force, as well as SOCOM itself, acquiring light attack aircraft for more than a decade now, this was also a stated focus of the latest round of experiments between 2017 and 2018. The second phase of this effort, which only involved tests of the A-29 and AT-6C, included “flight scenarios [that] will consist of both day and night missions in air interdiction, close air support, armed overwatch, and combat search and rescue,” according to an official Air Force news item at the time. Furthermore, the Air Force revived the LAAR moniker to describe broader possible future light-attack aircraft acquisition efforts in its own budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which it released in February 2019. “LAA squadrons will provide a deployable and sustainable multirole attack capability, capable of performing a diverse array of attack missions, including but not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Armed Reconnaissance, Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR), Airborne Forward Air Control (FAC-A), and Interdiction,” one of the supporting documents says. This was of course before the Air Force appeared to completely change course and focus more on the limited acquisition of A-29s and AT-6Cs for the aforementioned ACC and AFSOC efforts. The budget documents appeared to be based on a plan devised in 2018 to acquire up to 359 light attack aircraft, which now appears to have been shelved indefinitely. Whatever the case, the idea that the Air Force has not been aware until relatively recently of the demand for light attack aircraft that can also serve in the armed overwatch role, as Roper seemed to imply had been the case, is dubious at best. It is also difficult to understand why the service now needs to begin an all-new set of experiments to focus on this particular mission set despite the information it and other services have gathered over the course of multiple light attack aircraft programs in the past 10 years. One of the two OV-10G+ Broncos that SOCOM used during the Combat Dragon II experiments., Nick Thomas “My frustration is almost palpable at why it is taking so long to get this platform out where the warfighters need it,” Representative Mike Waltz, a Florida Republican, a Green Beret and member of the House Armed Services Committee, said at a briefing at the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute  in September 2019. “In that vein, if the Air Force can’t or doesn’t want to or isn’t moving fast enough to get it out there, then we’ve introduced legislation to shift that authority over to Special Operations Command.” With the House and Senate still divided over the language in their respective versions of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, and the looming threat of more short-term defense spending packages and a potential government shutdown in the coming months, it’s not clear when the Air Force may find itself compelled to act or give up what exists of its light attack program to SOCOM. A final defense budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which could provide more clues as to the real state of this program, seems equally unlikely to emerge any time soon. “This is a capability and need that special operators serving in 60 or 70 countries around the world need, and have needed for many years,” Representative Waltz added in September. The Air Force’s latest “discovery” of the long-standing demand for a manned armed overwatch capability, which it itself has repeatedly identified as a core requirement for any future light attack aircraft, shows pretty clearly that these calls have fallen on deaf ears.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 20, 2019",Chilean Protestors Down Drone By Dazzling It With Dozens Of Laser Pointers (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the key topics we discuss here at The War Zone constantly is counter-drone and short-range air defense capabilities, or the glaring lack thereof , and other directed energy defensive systems . One such capability that is emerging as an immediately obtainable and potentially robust solution to countering some drones and missiles that rely on electro-optical and infrared guidance systems are laser dazzlers . Basically, they fire a modulated laser beam at the target, blinding its optical sensors and throwing it off track and even downing it as a result. They can also be used to limit an enemy’s ability to gather intelligence via manned platforms by blinding their sensors. It looks like a very low-end and impromptu version of this concept was put to work by Chilean protesters very recently. The video, which appeared on social media earlier in the week, shows a large gathering of protesters shining high-powered handheld laser pointers, which have been used by protesters recently to deter riot police and blind facial recognition cameras, at a drone overhead. Those devices, shining at the drone’s optics from all different angles, sent it wobbling through the air, before briefly recovering, just to nosedive again and crash into the ground. Check out the video for yourself: Some smaller hobby and commercial drones have various autopilot systems and fail-safe software that allows them to maintain safe flight and even return to their original point of origin if they lose contact with their controller, but even with those capabilities, they wouldn’t engage automatically if their camera was blinded. Things happen fast and even engaging a fail-safe mode would have to be done by the user quickly once their video feed is blinded. Regardless, in this case, the laser pointers meant certain death for the lurking drone in question. While laser countermeasures that dazzle the infrared seekers on short-range heat-seeking missiles have been a reality for many years —they are even finding their way onto fighters now —more powerful and advanced dazzlers are now entering the maritime environment. Russia has already fielded a dazzler system on some of their surface combatants and the U.S. Navy has just installed its first dazzler, named ODIN, on the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Dewey (DDG-105). You can read all about this new system in this recent piece of ours. The impromptu downing of the small drone in Chile via lasers is definitely timely and the use of consumer-grade lasers could become a common application for fending off drones in no-drone airspace and other sensitive areas. Just blinding their optics and thus eliminating their reason for being overhead—to capture video for various reasons—could be enough to deter some of them from flying in the first place. Tying in a few dazzlers dispersed around a large area into a counter-drone system with detection capabilities could make flying one over a denied area entirely useless in the first place. The only major issue with such a concept is target discrimination. The same lasers that can blind drone optics may also blind human pilots, which continues to be a big problem domestically and abroad. But many counter UAS systems use modular radars, passive electronic sensors, and their own infrared cameras to better classify potential drone threats. As such, using the lower power dazzlers could be a fairly low risk and obtainable way of keeping unwanted drones at bay. So yeah, those protesters were definitely on to something. UPDATE : There is a claim and circulating that the drone’s landing was controlled enough for the owner to retrieve it. A video online supposedly shows a drone operator in the crowd after landing a drone. Obviously, drones are very common at these types of things, often with multiple types overhead at any given time. So, we can’t be certain this was the drone in question and its operator, but it would seem likely considering the account and video. If it was, we still don’t know why it made the erratic landing or why the operator brought it down at all, to begin with. As the article states, it is likely because he could barely see anything via its video stream once the lasers were on the drone, but maybe there were other factors.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 24, 2019",State Department Has A Burning Building Simulator To Prepare Staff For The Next Benghazi,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Department of State has released videos and photos showing a part of a training course for diplomatic staff covering how to respond to attacks on their compounds involving incendiary weapons and other deliberately set fires, as well as how to quickly and safely escape burning buildings, if necessary. The State Department, among other U.S. government agencies, saw a pronounced need for personnel to have these skills sets after the infamous Benghazi Consulate attack in 2012. During that incident, terrorists torched a part of the diplomatic compound, leading to the deaths of then-U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith from smoke inhalation. The demonstration of the so-called “smokehouse” training facility was part of a media package accompanying the official opening of the Foreign Affairs Security Training Center (FASTC) in Blackstone, Virginia, on Nov. 14, 2019. The FASTC, the State Department’s newest training center, has been operating on a limited scale for some time already and the State Department expects it to become fully operational before the end of the year. There are actually multiple smokehouses at FASTC, each made up of a number of modified shipping containers, including an L-shaped one and a multi-story structure, which would offer a more complex training experience. The videos that the State Department released shows that during a training session, these structures are deliberately filled with so much smoke that it is virtually impossible to see. A view of the smokehouses at FASTC., Department of State As a result, the clip, seen below, primarily shows the view through a handheld thermal imager, such as the ones firefighters use to find and rescue individuals in burning buildings, and it would be otherwise difficult to tell what’s going on. Beyond the visual impairments, which also include limited light and strobing lights, the kind one would associate with many modern fire alarm systems, the smokehouse is also filled with a cacophony of noise. This includes recordings of gunfire, people shouting, crying babies , and more. Another, potentially seizure-inducing clip, seen below, filmed mostly without the aid of the thermal imager, gives a great sense of just how disorienting the entire experience must be for the participants. This is the exact kind of sensory overload State Department personnel might actually have to deal with while trying to escape from a real burning structure in the immediate aftermath of an attack. This is undoubtedly valuable added realism to go along with what might, in a vacuum, seem like simple fire safety instructions that most Americans learn in grade school – things like stay low, stay together, first check a door handle to see if it is hot to avoid potentially opening it to find a raging fire on the other side. An instructor directs an individual as they emerge from the smokehouse at FASTC., Department of State It’s not surprising, given the notoriety of the Benghazi attack, that the State Department choose to highlight the smokehouse and the rest of the Fire As A Weapon (FAAW) training course during the formal opening event with media in attendance. Nearly 32,000 State Department personnel and contractors have passed through the FAAW training program, which is offered at multiple sites, according to a placard on the smokehouse. Information about the FAAW training course on the door to one of FASTC’s smokehouses., Department of State That same sign says that in addition to learning how to safely crawl out of a burning building in a potential warzone, individuals in the course also learn about typical fire attack tactics, the science of fire itself and what different kinds of fires can do to different materials, how to use a 10-pound fire extinguisher, and the proper employment of the Ocenco Emergency Escape Breathing Device (EEBD). The EEBD has been in service with militaries, primarily navies, including the U.S. Navy, for years. In the simplest terms, this device is a self-contained oxygen supply that will work for between 10 to 15 minutes, offering time for an individual to try to escape from a smoke-filled area to safety. The Navy video below shows the procedure for using this system. The State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) expects to train up to 10,000 personnel each year at the sprawling training area, including DSS agents, diplomatic staff, and contractors bound for stints at embassies and other diplomatic facilities abroad. FASTC offers a host of other training spaces, as well. This includes indoor shoot houses, explosives ranges, mock urban environments, high-speed and off-road driving courses, and more. Much of the facility looks like many other highly realistic Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) sites that the U.S. military and other government agencies use around the country. Many foreign countries utilize similar training centers, as well. A map showing FASTC’s main sections., Department of State An aerial view of some of the driving courses at FASTC., Department of State DSS personnel respond to a mock attack on a convoy in a simulated urban area at FASTC., Department of State All told, the FASTC looks set to play a major role in preparing DSS and other diplomatic personnel, as well as others heading to take up positions working for the State Department overseas in potentially dangerous locales. In a post-Benghazi world, the smokehouse training will no doubt continue to be an especially important part of ensuring those individuals are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 23, 2020",Russia Is Eying More Armed Icebreakers After Launching Missile-Toting Arctic Patrol Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian shipbuilding industry official says that the country’s plans for fleets armed icebreakers, such as the Project 23550 Ice class corvettes, are growing and that they may be able to carry more even weapons depending on their exact configuration. This comes nearly three weeks after the launch of the first Project 23550 ship, the Ivan Papanin , which will already be able to carry containerized cruise missile launchers. This ships and others in its class may ultimately have a 100mm main gun, instead of a 76mm one as originally planned, too. Valery Polyakov, who serves an adviser to the head of Krylov State Research Center, a state-run shipbuilding research and development group, offered the update on Russia’s armed icebreaker plans to state media outlet TASS on Oct. 14, 2019. Krylov, which has also been involved in the development of new, more traditional surface warships, including extremely ambitious amphibious assault ship and aircraft carrier concepts , is set to celebrate its 125th anniversary tomorrow. “There will be ice-breakers and ice-breaking ships, in other words, ships capable of moving at a sufficient speed through ice floes of [a] certain thickness. In fact, they will be armed icebreakers,” Polyakov. “Where the ice is thin, there will be more weapons and the other way round.” Polyakov said this latter point was the result of the need to devote more or less mass to ice-breaking reinforcements on different categories of icebreakers. However, he did not name any particular classes of ships or specific weapon systems as examples. The most obvious example, of course, is the Project 23550 design. Admiralty Shipyards, part of Russia’s state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), launched the first of these for the Russian Navy, Ivan Papanin , on Oct. 25, 2019, in St. Petersburg. This same yard expects to lay the keel for the second ship, the future Nikolai Zubov , next year, which it says will also mark the beginning of the production of the serial design with minor, unspecified differences. Vyborg Shipyard, in the town of the same name to the northwest of St. Petersburg, will reportedly build at least two more of these ships for the country’s border patrol, as well. These 9,000-ton displacement ships can reportedly break through ice up to five and a half feet thick, making a relatively light icebreaker, though still more capable in such an environment than a traditional ship. Heavy icebreakers can push through ice packs up to 10 feet thick, while medium designs are typically described as being only able to pierce through ice up to eight feet thick. Icebreakers historically have generally not been designed for any real combat, either. Ivan Papanin and its cousins notably have space in the rear specifically for containerized missile launchers capable of firing the Klub and Kalibr anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles. It is possible that those launchers, or others that fit in the same modular space, will be able to fire other existing or future cruise missiles, as well. They will also feature an integral main gun in a turret on the bow. Reports had indicated that this would be an AK-176MA 76mm gun. After speaking with Polyakov, TASS reported that the Ivan Papanin and other ships in the class might actually come armed with an AK-190 turret , also known as the A-190, which has an 100mm gun. The Project 23550s also have a helipad in the rear and at least one previous artist’s conception of the ship shows a Ka-29 armed light transport helicopter onboard. This could give the ships an additional means of engaging hostile threats. An artist’c onception of the Project 23550 design with the AK-176MA turret, containerized missile launchers at the rear, and a Ka-29 helicopter on the helipad., Pella Shipyard While we don’t know if Polyakov was speaking specifically about the Project 23550 getting additional weapons on top of these systems, it would make sense to do so, if possible, especially if Russia expects these to be more combat-oriented vessels. Even just the installation of a close-in protection system, such as the new Pantsir-ME , which features both command-guided surface-to-air missiles and a pair of six-barrel 30mm rotary cannons, would help shield the ship from incoming threats. Added capabilities could also include non-kinetic systems, such as optical dazzlers now entering service elsewhere in the Russian Navy that are designed to blind and confuse optical seekers on incoming weapons, optical sensors on hostile ships and aircraft, and enemy personnel. https://youtube.com/watch?v=t4F2_Zq_YsU Polyakov may also have been referring to broader plans to consider arming other existing or future icebreakers and other ice-capable ships in the Russian Navy and elsewhere across the country’s security services. Russia already has a notably large icebreaking fleet with approximately 40 of varying sizes , but it is also in the process of building more. These include the new conventional Project 22600 and nuclear-powered Project 22220 icebreakers and the ice-capable Project 03182 multi-purpose tankers. Russia has already taken delivery of a number of other ice-capable support ships in the Project 20180-series in recent years. None of these ships are armed in their present configuration, but it might be possible to integrate weapons, especially by using containerized systems, onto them later depending on the physical space and power constraints of their respective designs. An artist’s conception of the Project 03182 ice-capable multi-purpose tanker, another component of the Russian Navy’s planned future Arctic-focused fleets., Zelenodolsk Design Bureau Whatever the full size and scope of Russia’s combat- and ice-capable fleets might look like in the end, it is hardly surprising that the country is interested in developing these capabilities given how strategic the Arctic region has become in recent years. Global climate change has already led to a steady reduction in the size of the polar ice cap and shortened the periods of the year where ice presents the greatest risks, which has, in turn, opened up the region to greater activity and geopolitical competition . Russia, as well as the United States, and to a lesser extent China , among others, has been working hard to expand its military presence in the Arctic and build up additional infrastructure to support growing deployments of ships , aircraft , and ground forces . The United States and others have also begun to express more interest in actual warships better suited to this frigid environment and giving them more firepower, too. There has even been talk in the past about giving the Coast Guard’s new heavy icebreakers a cruise missile capability , as well. For now, Russia’s Project 23550 ships remain the most visible example of this trend and are likely to be the first to enter operational service. The Russian Navy expects to formally commission Ivan Papanin in 2023, by which time the full extent of its plans for armed icebreakers and other ice-capable ships will have hopefully become clearer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 29, 2019",This Is How The Russian Military Tests If Its Vehicles Can Stand Up To A Nuclear Blast,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia recently offered a behind-the-scenes look at how it tests military vehicles’ resistance to the effects that result from a nuclear explosion . This included demonstrations of a huge blast tube and an electromagnetic pulse generator, recreating what might happen to a vehicle, its occupants, and various onboard systems if it were to find itself in the wake of a nearby nuclear detonation. TV Zvezda , the official television channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense, aired an entire segment about the 12th Central Research Institute’s nuclear effects test facility, situated just over 50 miles northeast of Moscow, on Nov. 10, 2019. It also released a smaller featurette about the blast tube three days later. This center, which operates sites across the country, supports various nuclear and other WMD-related research and development and testing, including work related to the controversial nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered cruise missile Burevestnik. One of these weapons was at the center of a serious accident this year and you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone stories . The TV Zvezda program focused on nuclear effects testing of the members of Russia’s new Kungas family of unmanned ground vehicles, which is part of the overall operational testing and evaluation of these UGVs ahead of their official acceptance into service. The blast tube at the 12th Central Research Institute’s test facility is about 370 feet long overall. It uses an explosive charge at one end to create a focused shockwave that comes out the other side. A vehicle, or anything else, positioned at the opening of the tube then gets hit with the blast so researchers can gather data and analyze the impacts on it, as well as its simulated occupants. A satellite image of the blast tube test facility as of August 2019. The opening where the blast force exists the tube is at the right., Google Earth TV Zvezda ‘s video shows that the effects are scalable, meaning that personnel at the site can increase or decrease the force of the blast depending on the requirements of the test. Differing levels of force would reflect the blasts a vehicle could expect to experience depending on how close it might be to the actual point of detonation. The normal and high-speed video footage of various tests show that the effects can be scaled back far enough that the impacts are relatively minor. The smaller featurette that TV Zvezda posted online on Nov. 13 also makes clear that the blast tube can also create shockwaves powerful enough to practically flatten on a typical civilian car. The full television program, seen below, also offers additional and extremely interesting footage of various Soviet nuclear tests. This includes one segment showing a BMD-1 airborne infantry fighting vehicle literally getting blown away by a shockwave. TV Zvezda ‘s presentation also shows test facilities that generate electromagnetic pulses, another byproduct of nuclear detonations. These pulses can disrupt or knock out insufficiently hardened electronics – such as a television the channel’s reporter rigged up on top of a car for a demonstration – which, in turn, could leave military vehicles with severely degraded capabilities, or even suffering a potential mission kill, depending on the exact configuration and purpose. That Russia is putting its UGVs through these tests makes good sense, given that these largely remote-controlled systems rely heavily on various electronic systems to perform their missions and remain in contact with their controllers. TV Zvezda used this car with a television on top to demonstrate the ability of the 12th Central Research Institute’s nuclear effects testing facilities to produce an electromagnetic pulse., TV Zvezda capture Having facilities to produce the effects from a nuclear weapon going off without having to actually do so is absolutely necessary, and Russia isn’t the only country to have such test sites. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories, for example, operates its own scalable blast tube . Sandia personnel can change the overall length of the tube, which is made up of three- to 12-foot sections, and it can handle up to 2,600 pounds of explosives to create different magnitudes of force. Russia and the United States have extremely limited options for conducting nuclear effects testing with actual nuclear weapons, even if they wanted to. In 1963, the Soviet Union and the United States, among others, signed the Particular Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, or PTBT , which prohibited above-ground nuclear testing. Russia has also signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT , which prevents full-scale nuclear weapons testing in any environment. The U.S. government has signed, but not ratified the CTBT, though it has its own self-imposed moratorium on all nuclear testing. It’s not clear whether TV Zvezda chose to air this segment now for any particular reason, but it does come amid growing tensions between Russia and the United States about nuclear weapons developments and the modernization of each countries respective arsenals. Earlier this year, the late Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, which also impacted the developing and fielding of various land-based conventional missiles, collapsed under the weight of Russian violations . There are now concerns that the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, which applies to various strategic nuclear weapons systems, may be at risk . This deal will expire in 2021 unless Russia and the United States agree to extend it and, even then, this only means it will remain in force until 2023. Both countries are actively developing a wide array of nuclear and improved nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Russia’s programs include a number of particularly novel and controversial systems, including Burevestnik, seen in the video below, as well as the Poseidon long-range nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered doomsday torpedo. Just this week, the Kremlin announced that it would put the first examples of the modified intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide vehicle into silos as it works to make that weapon system operational. At the same time, the U.S. military has recently appeared to revive more robust planning for how it might fight a nuclear conflict. Both the United States and Russia have conducted a steady stream of major strategic exercises in recent years, as well. All told, discussions about nuclear weapons, and the potential for nuclear conflict, have come very much back into vogue. At the same time, this can only give new emphasis to the importance of the kind of unique and impressive effects testing that organizations such as Russia’s 12th Central Research Institute perform.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Intact Seeker Section From An Iron Dome Tamir Interceptor Fell Into Gaza,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just hours after we posted a story about a report that an Israeli Stunner surface-to-air missile used in the David’s Sling medium-range air defense system fell into Syrian territory and was transferred by the Assad regime to Russia, images have appeared on social media showing what appears to be the intact fuse section of a Tamir interceptor used by the Iron Dome system . This proximity fuse system is highly advanced as it has to detect a small and fast-flying target—a rocket in most cases—and detonate the missile’s warhead with perfect timing in order to destroy it. It is also highly miniaturized yet hardened enough to withstand the extreme G forces sustained by the super-maneuverable interceptor. UPDATE : Upon further review of the photos, I actually believe the section includes the missile’s active radar seeker, as well. That seems to be the component hanging out of the front of the tube. In other words, this would be the entire seeker and fuse section forward of the fins. Obviously, the loss would be even more significant if this is indeed the case. Tamir uses a very sensitive active radar seeker and a command data-link system to chase down an incoming rocket. These components and its onboard autopilot get the missile within extremely close range of its target, at which time the missile’s proximity fuse system detects the object as it begins to pass abeam the missile and detonates the onboard warhead, blasting it out of the sky. The missile is so agile and accurate that often times it actually slams into the incoming target, but it is not designed as strictly a hit-to-kill weapon by any means. Check out the images of the interceptor in the tweet below: As is common on many air-to-air missiles, the fuse system is located in a collar arrangement on the forward body of the missile, behind its seeker. A 360-degree staring laser system is used to sense the nearby target as it enters into the warhead’s lethal range. It then triggers command logic that orders the detonation of the high-explosive warhead, which erupts outward in a ring of shrapnel in a wedge shape pattern around the missile. We don’t know precisely what components are used on the Tamir’s fuse system, but it is described by its manufacturer as “unique.” RAFAEL RAFAEL RAFAEL RAFAEL As we discussed in our article on the claimed loss of the Stunner missile to Russian intelligence, there is potentially a high price of using highly advanced weaponry in combat that goes beyond the normal factors. The potential for massive technological and intellectual property loss is very real. Even the most advanced missiles fail, as do highly complex aircraft. When they do, they can literally fall right into a foe’s hands where they can be studied on a hardware and even software level and potentially reverse engineered. At the very least, knowhow gleaned from tearing the components apart can be integrated into the enemy’s own industrial knowledge base and countermeasure initiatives. RAFAEL Each Iron Dome missile costs between roughly $40,000 and $100,000, depending on who you ask. Two missiles are usually launched at each target to increase the probability of kill. Often times large throngs of Tamirs will stream out of Iron Dome batteries during a large barrage, or even by mistake , resulting in an almost otherworldly light show in the sky. It is truly an amazing capability to behold. The missiles are meant to self destruct if they do not engage a target, destroying the missile and its components beyond recovery, but clearly, that doesn’t always work as intended. Iron Dome batteries have been very active in recent days as tensions between Israel and factions in Gaza have spiked following the targeted assassination of Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Baha Abu al-Ata earlier in the week. Over 450 rockets have been fired since then. As such, Iron Dome has been extremely active in trying to intercept rockets that pose a threat to populated areas. We have no idea where this laser fuse component ended up or where exactly it was found in Gaza and by who, but it serves as another reminder that what goes up must come down, and sometimes it does so very much intact.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 13, 2019",This Is Our First Look At A CH-47 Chinook With Super Powerful T408 Engines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A picture has emerged of a Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter fitted with a pair of powerful General Electric T408 engines. The company had said in May that it was preparing to flight test a Chinook equipped with these engines, which are the same ones found on Sikorsky’s troubled, but immensely powerful CH-53K King Stallion . The official Twitter account for the U.S. Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Aviation and Missile Center, which is situated at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, posted a shot of the rear of the modified helicopter, which has the tail number 067, on the social media site on Nov. 12, 2019. The Tweet also included a view of the same helicopter from the front, but taken at a different time when it had no engines installed at all. At present, the Army is not actively pursuing this re-engine effort for its own Chinooks as part of the larger Block II upgrade program . However, the Tweet said that Aviation and Missile Center and Boeing have partnered together to test the engine installation. It is not clear if this is occurring under a traditional research and development contract or as part of some other form of a partnered agreement, such as a cooperative research and development agreement, or CRADA . The picture does show that the T408s use entirely new nacelles with a more square shape, as compared to the circular ones associated with the Honeywell Aerospace T55s found on existing Chinooks. The nacelles also feature reinforcement bars between them and the helicopter’s fuselage. The picture of the CH-47, tail number 067, with the new T408 engines., US Army The same helicopter without any engines fitted., US Army A look at a standard CH-47F from the rear., US Army The Army did fund the development of the necessary fuselage reinforcements, as well as an updated drivetrain, as part of the Block II upgrades. This could make it easier for the service, as well as any other country buying Block II CH-47Fs, to decide to add the new engines onto the helicopters at a later date. The full Block II update also includes new rotor blades and a revised fuel tank configuration, among other improvements. It’s not clear whether or not the helicopter has flown yet in this configuration. The picture appears to show personnel on the ground conducting tests or otherwise performing work. “We’re getting it ready to fly,” Chuck Dabundo, the H-47 program manager at Boeing, had told reporters during a media tour in May 2019, according to Rotor and Wing International magazine. However, he did not say when, or where, the first flight might take place. A CH-47F with T408s had the potential to be significantly more capable than the helicopter in its existing configuration, which already has very good speed, payload , and hot-and-high performance . The General Electric engines each produce 7,500 shaft horsepower (SHP), around 2,500 SHP more than the T55-GA-714As on standard F models. Boeing has said that the Block II CH-47Fs will already have increased performance compared to the original F variants even without the new engines. Standard US Army CH-47F Chinooks., US Army A T408-equipped CH-47F still won’t have the same lifting power and maximum payload capacity of Sikorsky’s CH-53K , but it is possible that the new engines could close that gap and make the upgraded Chinooks much more attractive when compared to the extremely expensive and troubled King Stallion. This has already raised questions in Congress about whether the Marines should consider the CH-47F as an alternative to the CH-53K, a debate you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Boeing could easily pitch Chinooks with new engines to future operators and offer refits to countries that already have CH-47 fleets. The Chinook has a well-established operator base and sales have continued to be relatively steady in recent years, with the U.S. government just approving another prospective sale of CH-47Fs to the United Arab Emirates last week . India just began receiving its first Chinooks earlier this year. Israel and Germany are also actively looking for helicopters to replace their aging Sikorsky CH-53 Yasurs and CH-53Gs , respectively, and have narrowed down their searches to the CH-47F and the CH-53K. With this picture showing that tests of the new engine configuration are proceeding, hopefully we will learn more about this exciting upgrade for the venerable Chinook soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2020",Air Force Updates Massive Ordnance Penetrator Bombs Amid New Iranian Nuclear Posturing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is continuing to update its stockpile of 30,000-pound class Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker busters, or MOPs, and bring older MOPs up to the latest standard, also known as the GBU-57E/B. This comes as Iran has announced that it will begin injecting uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges at its underground nuclear facility at Fordo – the kind of prospective target that drove the development of the MOP in the first place – a significant breach of the controversial 2015 international agreement over the country’s nuclear program. On Oct. 28, 2019, the Air Force announced that it had awarded $90 million contracts to both Superior Forge & Steel Corp. of Lima, Ohio and Ellwood National Forge in Irvine, Pennsylvania for the production of an unspecified number of case assemblies for the BLU-127C/B warhead. The service separately confirmed to The War Zone that this is the warhead at the core of the GBU-57E/B variant, which has been in operational inventory since 2016. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is presently the only aircraft capable of and clear to employ the MOP operationally, though B-52 bombers have dropped some of the weapons in prior testing. The future B-21 Raider stealth bomber will also likely be able to carry these weapons. It is unclear how many MOPs of different variants, or in total, there are available for operational use. As of September 2011, the prime contractor, Boeing, had delivered 20 of the bombs , but it is known that there have been subsequent orders and that a number of the weapons have been expended in various tests since then. It is likely that the total number of available weapons has swelled in recent years. In February 2018, the service had announced that it was buying an unknown number of additional complete MOPs from Boeing, which would also have likely have been in the GBU-57E/B configuration. The month before, Bloomberg had reported that a “ fourth upgrade ” program for the MOP was complete and that existing bombs in the stockpile were also being retrofitted. It’s not entirely clear how the GBU-57E/B variant differs from previous MOPs, either. “The E/B variant enhances the ability to penetrate concrete structures and deliver the high explosive payload,” Ilka Cole, the Chief of Media Operations in the Public Affairs Office for the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida told The War Zone by Email. Eglin is also home to the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Armament Directorate, which is responsible for managing the MOP program. The MOP effort dates back to at least 2002 and early publicly available graphics showed the bomb being able to burrow down up to 60 feet to get to their target. In 2007, an official Air Force news story said that this capability had expanded to up to 200 feet . Whether or not this maximum depth accounts for penetrating through layers reinforced concrete is unclear. A very early graphic from the MOP program showing the bomb able to penetrate up to 60 feet under the ground. By 2007, the weapon was reportedly capable of burrowing nearly four times deeper than this., DOD via GlobalSecurity.org The story from 2007 would have likely been referring to the first and second warheads, known as BLU-127/Bs and -127A/Bs, though it might have been referencing work on the subsequent BLU-127B/Bs, as well. GBU-57/B, -57A/B, and -57B/B were fitted with the BLU-127/B, -127A/B, and -127B/B warheads respectively. What subsequent improvements Boeing made to the GBU-57C/B and -57D/B variants are unclear, but, as The War Zone previously reported , the latter type did at least include an improved fuze. The “C/B” part of the BLU-127C/B designation is arbitrarily assigned and does not automatically mean it was first used in the GBU-57C/B, either. Based on the fact that the GBU-57E/B model was in inventory in at least some numbers in 2016, it is likely that these weapons were developed as part of the Enhanced Threat Reduction IV (ETR-IV) upgrade program, which Boeing won the contract for the year before. Evaluation of bombs with the ETR-IV updates also continued into 2017, according to the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. Whatever the GBU-57E/B’s exact capabilities are, it would seem reasonable to assume that it can penetrate deeper than the MOP variants available in 2007. We know that the inert BLU-127C/B, at least, has a “booster” in the forward portion of the warhead, but it is unclear if this refers to a system that physically propels that section, such as rocket motor, for added penetration or an explosive charge that simply accelerates the detonation of the main charge. The added penetration would be necessary to strike at especially deeply buried and hardened facilities, such as Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordo. The main portions of this site are reportedly around 295 feet underground and further shielded by multiple feet of reinforced concrete. A satellite image showing what is visible of the facility at Fordo from above ground., Google Earth In addition, Cole, the spokesperson for the 96th Test Wing, said that the GBU-57E/B was available with both “live and inert” warheads. “Inert weapons perform a variety of roles based upon mission requirements,” she added. Thanks to its GPS guidance, it is possible that B-2s could drop multiple weapons on the same spot, one after another, using inert versions first to help “dig down” to the target, softening up the layers above and allowing each consecutive bomb to burrow deeper. Inert versions would also be useful for test and evaluation and training purposes. There is, of course, no indicator that the United States is actively preparing to strike Fordo, or any of Iran’s other underground nuclear and ballistic missile-related sites . The United States already pulled out of the Iran Deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018. The other parties, chiefly France, German, and the United Kingdom, have since struggled to keep the agreement alive. Iran has steadily sought to put pressure on those countries to make concessions, especially as U.S. sanctions have increased. The decision to begin filling centrifuges with uranium hexafluoride gas, which is banned under the JCPOA, is a major indicator of how far the regime in Tehran is willing to weaken what is left of the deal to try and get those countries to agree to its terms. Though Iranian President Rouhani has not said that Fordo will begin enriching uranium again, which the Iran deal also prohibits, filling the centrifuges with the gas is a clear step in this direction. This all comes just a day after Iran announced that it had doubled the number of IR-6 centrifuges in operation at the site and that it was working on an even more advanced IR-9 that can enrich uranium 50 times faster than the country’s original IR-1. Rouhani has given the JCPOA’s European members just two months to find a way around American sanctions before Iran might take new actions, which could include resuming enrichment. Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AOEI), speaks to reporters in Tehran in September 2019 in front of various centrifuges., SalamPix/Abaca/Sipa USA via AP Images Critics of the Iran deal have long contended that it left the regime in Tehran with a “breakout” capability to build nuclear weapons if it chose to do so. At the same time, publicly available U.S. intelligence assessments have continually indicated that the country does not have an active nuclear weapons program and was abiding by the terms of the JCPOA even immediately after the United States withdrew. Tensions between the United States and Iran have otherwise been building for months, with the U.S. government, among others, blaming the Iranians for a string of attacks on commercial oil tankers in the Middle East, as well as more recent and unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. Iran also shot down a U.S. Navy Global Hawk drone over the Gulf of Oman in June and seized a British-flagged oil tanker the following month, keeping it impounded for weeks in retaliation for the U.K. government doing the same to an Iranian supertanker in Gibraltar. It is worth noting that the potential threats that the United States developed the MOP to address aren’t limited to Iran, either. North Korea, which has also become increasingly upset with the lack of progress in its own negotiations over sanctions with the U.S. government, also has extensive networks of underground facilities . The GBU-57-series could also be useful for engaging deep, hardened targets during a larger scale conventional conflict against potential peer adversaries, such as China or Russia . With all this in mind, it’s hardly surprising that the Air Force is continuing to work to upgrade the MOP and bring its existing inventory up to the latest, deepest penetrating standard. UPDATE — Ilka Cole, the 96th Test Wing’s Chief of Media Operations has confirmed to The War Zone by Email that the GBU-57E/B variant was in the Air Force’s available inventory by 2016 and that there are no newer variants at this time. An unspecified number of GBU-57D/Bs also remain in inventory at this time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 14, 2019",Boeing To Flight Test CH-47 With Same Monster Engines Found On Sikorsky’s New CH-53K,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing says that it will begin flight tests of a CH-47 Chinook equipped with more powerful General Electric T408 engines, the same ones that the U.S. Marine Corps’ future Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallions will use. The announcement comes amid a series of new delays in the troubled King Stallion program and a Congressionally mandated review of whether an alternative helicopter, such as the Chinook, might be able to meet Marine requirements instead. The Chicago-headquartered aircraft company provided the update on the integration of the T408 onto the CH-47 during a media tour last week ahead of the Paris Air Show. Boeing has been working on the project together with General Electric (GE) since 2016 as part of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Army. It is important to note that this engine effort is separate from that service’s larger CH-47F Block II upgrade program and there are no formal plans, as yet, to actually re-engine those helicopters in the future. “We’re pretty far along in the modifications of the aircraft,” Chuck Dabundo, Boeing’s H-47 program manager, said during the media tour, according to Rotor and Wing International magazine. “We’re getting it ready to fly.” Boeing has not disclosed any estimates about how much additional lifting capacity or other added performance a CH-47F with two T408s will have compared the existing variant. The GE engines do each produce 7,500 shaft horsepower (SHP), around 2,500 more SHP than the present T55s . A US Army soldier works on one of the T55 engines on a CH-47F Chinook., US Army GE also heavily promotes the engines as fuel efficient and easier to maintain than older designs, which might mean a re-engined Chinook might have greater range and be cheaper to operate. The engine maker specifically says that the T408 offers an 18 percent improvement in fuel consumption and features fewer moving parts than its older T64 , the latest iterations of which is in a similar SHP class to the T55. It remains to be seen if these benefits over the T64 translate to similar benefits over the T55. It’s also unclear whether the CH-47 demonstrator with the new engines will include any of the Block II upgrades, such as the updated drivetrain, new rotor blades, revised fuel-tank configuration, and reinforced fuselage. Boeing has previously said that these updates will allow the updated CH-47Fs to lift more and give them improved performance overall. The Chinook is already well known for its hot-and-high performance and these upgrades, plus a new engine, could give it even more capability in that regard. What is clear is that the T408s are an essential component of Sikorsky’s CH-53K, which has three of them. The engines give the King Stallion nearly 60 percent more power over the older CH-53E Super Stallion, according to GE . The CH-53K has demonstrated an ability to carry up to 36,000 pounds of cargo, but the Marines expect it to more commonly carry less. One key goal is the ability to carry an external load of 27,000 pounds over a 110-mile combat radius in hot and high conditions. Boeing says that the latest iterations of the CH-47F can only carry around 21,000 pounds . If the new engines can push that figure at all closer to King Stallion’s 27,000-pound lifting capacity, it could put the Chinook in a new position when competing with Sikorsky’s offering. This is particularly important because the CH-53K program has suffered from various technical problems, which have produced a string of significant delays stretching all the way back to the program’s beginnings in 2006 . Significant problems continue to persist, which you can read about in more detail here . Just between May 2018 and January 2019, the Marine Corps’ projected date for reaching Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with the King Stallion has slipped from December 2019 to October 2021. A US Marine Corps CH-53K King Stallion., USMC These issues have prompted members of Congress to order the Pentagon’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) to review the CH-53K program and assess whether or not there are any alternative options available. Some legislators have publicly asked the Marines whether a variant of the CH-47 would be a viable substitute. “As we step back and we look at this program, as a heavylift helicopter, it’s the only one that this nation has that can do what it can do,” U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Steven Rudder, the service’s Deputy Commandant for Aviation, told lawmakers during a hearing in April 2019. “There is no other helicopter in the world that has lifted 36,00 pounds … 100 miles ship-to-shore with 27,000 pounds … and go back and forth all day long.” CAPE has shared this opinion , assessing early on its review that if the Marines ditched the CH-53K for a variant of the CH-47, they would have to make operational adjustments to accommodate the lost lift capacity. But if a T408-engined Chinook has capabilities closer to that of the King Stallion, it could significantly alter those assessments. Of course, there are additional factors that would also come into play. While U.S. and foreign CH-47 variants regularly conduct shorter-duration shipboard missions from Navy amphibious ships, a Marine Chinook would need specific features to support protracted operations at sea, including measures to mitigate saltwater corrosion. The CH-47 also may not be compatible with the very firm physical space constraints aboard those vessels. A US Army special operations MH-47G Chinook onboard the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge during a training exercise., USN It’s not clear whether CAPE has finished its review and delivered it to Congress, but, so far, the King Stallion program seems to be moving ahead unchecked. The Navy, which is managing the CH-53K program for the Marines, awarded Sikorsky, which is now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, a $1.3 billion contract for 12 of the helicopters on May 17, 2019 . The Marines still expect to eventually take delivery of 200 King Stallions in the coming years. But if the Marine Corps’ plans for the CH-53K remain unchanged, Chinooks with T408 engines could present a new challenge to future King Stallion sales. Germany and Israel are looking to replace their CH-53Gs and CH-53 Yasurs respectively. The CH-47F and CH-53K are already the primary contenders in both cases . If a CH-47F with two T408s is not drastically more expensive than the existing T55-equipped version, it could make the Chinook even more appealing. The Army has been buying new production F models for between $30 and $40 million each in recent years, depending on the total size of the purchase order, while the average unit cost for the CH-53K has ballooned to more than $120 million . Operational costs may also be lower, with two engines to maintain and feed fuel to rather than the King Stallions three. Also, with two engines instead of three, there should be less gearing and transmission complexity to deal with over the life of aircraft. An Israeli CH-53 Yasur., Yonatan Zalk/IAF The T408 engine upgrade could also be attractive to existing CH-47 customers as a potentially low-cost way of increasing the capabilities of these helicopters. The Army’s Block II upgrade effort has already paid for the development of the fuselage modifications necessary to accommodate larger, heavier engines and the service’s CRADA effort will now demonstrate the viability of the helicopter actually fitted with the new engines. “The engine kind of fell out [of the Block II upgrade program],” Randy Rotte, Director of Business Development for Cargo Helicopters and Future Vertical Lift at Boeing, recently told FlightGlobal . “However, everyone realizes that at some point that becomes the limiting factor on the aircraft to do more and that would be the next point to touch.” International Chinook sales could be increasingly important for Boeing, in general, given that its chief customer, the U.S. Army, is presently looking to scale back its CH-47 purchases and the Block II upgrade program. The service says it needs to do this ostensibly to free up funds for other higher priority modernization efforts, including various future rotorcraft as part of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. But there are no plans to curtail purchases of special operations MH-47Gs for the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and those helicopters could certainly benefit from the T408 upgrade, as well. Regardless, the Army looks set to find itself in a battle with Congress over this issue. The House Appropriations Committee has just recently recommended restoring all of the Block II upgrade funding that the service had cut out of its budget request for the upcoming 2020 Fiscal Year. All told, the futures of both the Army’s CH-47 program and the Marine’s CH-53K program seem to be in an increasingly uncertain state. At the same time, Boeing’s effort to integrate the T408 engine into the CH-47F is a logical next step for that helicopter and one that could make it very attractive to any future customers.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 5, 2023",If An Israeli Stunner Missile Really Did Fall Into Russian Hands It Is A Huge Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In recent days, it has been reported that an errant Stunner missile , the interceptor component of Israel’s David Sling medium-range air defense system, fell into Syrian territory in a fairly intact manner. Supposedly the Assad regime was able to recover it and transferred the advanced weapon to Moscow for examination and technological exploitation. Stunner represents cutting-edge missile technology that is in some ways more advanced than any other system on the planet. The idea that Russia could gain very valuable insights into its technology is especially troubling as surface-to-air missile systems have extremely high strategic importance for Russia and are one of the country’s most successful arms exports to both allies and enemies alike. Nearly a year and a half ago, the Jerusalem Post reported that two Stunners were fired at an OTR-21 Tochka (NATO reporting name SS-21 Scarab) short-range ballistic missile that rose out of western Syria for fear that it might fall into Israeli territory near the Sea of Galilee. The Russian-made ballistic missiles were fired by the Syrian Army against rebel positions in the area. After the Stunners were already launched, it became clear that the ballistic missile was not a threat to Israel so the David Sling operators ordered the missiles to self-destruct. One did just that, but the other failed to do so, careening into Syrian territory. This was the first operational use of the David Sling air defense system and until recently, there was no word about what came of the errant missile. Now a report from China’s SINA News (via Haaretz and Asia Times and other outlets) claims it was recovered relatively intact by Syrian forces and transferred into Russian hands. Stunner being launched. , Israel MoD The most unique aspect of Stunner—which was co-developed by American missile maker Raytheon and Israel’s Rafael—is its use of dual-mode terminal homing. Its canted “dolphin” nose houses both imaging infrared and active electronically scanned array millimeter-wave radar seekers. This makes the weapon far more challenging to decoy or jam and more reliable overall in intercepting whatever its target may be, from short-range ballistic missiles to stealth cruise missiles. Beyond its cutting-edge dual-mode seeker, the missile is packed with advanced and highly miniaturized systems, including a data link that is fully networked with its David Sling battery and other offboard sensor systems and platforms. The missile is also super maneuverable with an advanced propulsion system and uses a hit-to-kill concept of operations, meaning it does not carry a traditional warhead. It slams into its target instead. This allows the missile to be far lighter, more compact, and more maneuverable than its traditional high-explosive packing counterparts. Overall, Stunner is part of the middle tier in Israel’s three-tier integrated air defense system that is widely regarded as the most advanced in the world. You can read all about Stunner and its potential air-to-air adaptation in this past article of ours . Suffice it to say, the Russians would love to get their hands on its technology, even in a damaged form, and it would be a perfect offering for embattled dictator Bashar al Assad to extend to his overlords in Moscow . So far, the Israeli Defense Forces have not been willing to comment on the report. Even if it ends up being inaccurate, it is a good reminder of the real risks that go into using any advanced weapon system that is loaded with highly sensitive, proprietary technology on the modern battlefield. Dumping a stealth drone intact into Iran’s hands or a stealth Black Hawk’s tail into Pakistani hands was may be the most glaring illustrations of this, but just in 2017, an AIM-9X Sidewinder was fired over Syria by a US Navy Super Hornet and fell away from the aircraft as a dud. That missile ended up somewhere. As far as we know, its location was never identified by US forces or its allies, but it would have been potentially a huge technological coup if Russia were able to get their hands on it or even parts of it, just like the Stunner. This issue isn’t new, foreign materiel exploitation programs that are fed via espionage were staples of the Cold War. But it will only become more magnified as the years go by and evermore complex and “exquisite” aircraft and munitions that are literally made up of and packed full of highly-guarded technology proliferate around the globe. The F-35 enterprise is probably the most obvious risk when it comes to the potential sudden loss of massive amounts of sensitive technology in the years to come. The looming migration from manned mechanized warfare to unmanned mechanized warfare also has unique concerns in this regard. We will keep you up to date if we hear anything more about the missing Stunner. I wouldn’t be too surprised if the Russians eventually return it to Israel as they and the U.S. supposedly demanded some time ago. But by then the damage would have been done.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 15, 2020",Air Force Wants Its XQ-58A Valkyrie Drone To Help F-22s And F-35s Talk To Each Other,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force hopes to begin tests involving a Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie stealthy unmanned aircraft acting as a data-fusion and relay gateway between its F-22 Raptors and F-35A Joint Strike Fighters early next year. This will follow a separate experiment to first demonstrate that the new data link, known presently as GatewayOne, can enable the two jets to share information without degrading their stealthy signatures, scheduled to occur next month. Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, outlined the plan , which is as part of what he called a “connect-a-thon” rapid experimentation concept, at a Defense Writers Group breakfast in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 12, 2019. Preston Dunlap, who holds the recently created position of “ Chief Architect ” within Roper’s office, had announced the first phase of the gateway experiment last week at a separate event that Defense One hosted. “From zero to 60 in four months, [the goal] is to design and integrate the gateway so we can have something to triangulate,” Dunlap said on Nov. 7, 2019, according to Military.com . “For the first time, we want to be able to share data as we would like to in a relevant time and environment – and we want to operate in a highly contested environment – and ensure it gets [securely] from one place to the other.” A major, long-standing issue for the Air Force is that its two premier stealth fighters can’t talk to each other effectively at all, let alone do so in their full stealth modes. F-22s and F-35s both use specialized data links designed to have what is called a “low probability of intercept/low probability of detection,” or LPI/LPD, meaning that opponents are unlikely to notice the transmissions or at least won’t be able to reliably trace them back to the aircraft sending them. F-22s have a unique Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), an LPI/LPD system that can only share information with other Raptors, and can only receive information via the non-stealthy and much more common Link 16 waveform. F-35s have the stealthy Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), which also can’t share data with any aircraft that doesn’t have this system, though they can share and receive information across Link 16. As it stands now, only the F-35 has MADL, though the Air Force does plan to integrate it into its existing B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and make it a feature on its future B-21 Raiders . Both MADL and IFDL are also line-of-sight systems. US Air Force F-22 Raptors., USAF Lockheed Martin did demonstrate the ability of F-22s and F-35s to exchange information via Link 16 in 2013, as part of an experiment known as Project Missouri . However, so far, this has not become a standard capability for either aircraft. GatewayOne’s job will be to act as a transfer node for information passing between IFDLs on F-22s and MADLs on F-35s, as well as any other stealth aircraft carrying the latter data link in the future. The Air Force wants the December tests to be a proof of concept showing that it can do this job. For this phase of experiments, the service plans to install the system on a test stand on the ground and have Raptors and Joint Strike Fighters flying above try to send information through it successfully. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., USAF If GatewayOne works in that limited environment, the Air Force wants to then install it on an XQ-58A and test the system in the air sometime in April 2020. The service is working with Kratos to develop Valkyrie as a low-cost, stealthy platform that can work together tethered together with manned platforms in the “ loyal wingman ” role, as well as by itself or in networked swarms . These drones are supposed to be what the Air Force describes as “ attritable ,” meaning that they are cheap enough that commanders do not have to worry as much about whether or not they survive a mission. What might come after that is unclear, but it is possible that this system could find its way onto various other platforms, manned and unmanned, to provide this capability. This would be similar in many respects to what has happened to the existing Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN) communications hub, which can handle a wide variety of waveforms , including Link 16 and the Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), the latter being another popular U.S. military data transfer system. The Air Force operates manned Bombardier E-11A and unmanned EQ-4B Global Hawk aircraft equipped with BACN. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jN-dljp6k_I There is also the secretive Talon HATE pod, something you can read about more here . The Air Force is developing this system to help serve as a point of exchange for information between F-22s and F-15C/D Eagles and then on to other assets in the battlespace and beyond. A diagram showing how an F-15C/D carrying a Talon HATE pod will serve as a nexus between stealthy F-22s, other Eagles, and other assets, including ships and allied aircraft., Tyler Rogoway The service, in cooperation with Lockheed Martin, has also tested the U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane as a communications hub on an experimental basis . Just this year, as part of a test known as Project Riot , a U-2S acted a transfer node between an F-35 and a ground control station. The scenario involved the Joint Strike Fighter detecting a ballistic missile launch and feeding information to a missile defense command center to help with targeting that threat. There is already a separate concept operation for F-35 data sharing that involves “ daisy-chaining ” information from one Joint Strike Fighter to another via MADL until it reaches an aircraft a safe distance away from the center of the action. That aircraft can then broadcast it onward to other platforms using Link 16 or up to a satellite above. A U-2S with an experimental communications node, identified by the gold-colored antenna protruding from the white section of the underside of the forward fuselage., Lockheed Martin It’s hard to overstate how important it is for F-22s and F-35s to be able to rapidly exchange data with each other, as well as other platforms, while still maintaining their stealthy characteristics. Both aircraft have very powerful and multi-faceted sensor suites that can gather an immense amount of information to give their pilots a very good sense of what is going on in the battlespace around them. These aircraft often already act as “ quarterbacks ” for large aerial operations, including coalition efforts that also involve allied forces. In many cases, they are relegated to using voice directions to give crews in lesser aircraft directions, and even that may not be possible during a high-end fight. If these two fleets can more readily share that information between each other and with other aircraft, as well as other assets, including ships and ground forces, they can help build an even more complete operational picture. It can also allow these different assets to exchange targeting quality information to actually engage threats. This means that a stealth platform can use information from third-party sensors while using its own emitters as sparingly as possible to reduce its own vulnerability. Stealthy aircraft can also use their LPI/LPD sensors once they have penetrated into densely protected areas to find targets and then feed that information to non-stealthy platforms , which can then employ stand-off weapons from a safe distance against those targets . The U.S. Navy is also exploring similar concepts of operation as part of its Cooperative Engagement Capability and Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) programs, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Installing this capability on the XQ-58A makes good sense, too. Acting as a low-cost communications and data relay in high-risk environments, as well as helping push information from MADL and IFDL over the horizon, sounds like a perfect job for such a platform. Being able to process signals from either data link could also enable F-22 and F-35 pilots to exchange control of one or more Valkyries operating as a loyal wingman on the fly, as well. If GatewayOne works on the relatively small XQ-58A, the Air Force could likely migrate GatewayOne onto other platforms, as well, making the capability more widely available. Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Roper also made clear that he is looking at this particular connect-a-thon as a concept for driving rapid innovation and procurement, something he has become an outspoken advocate of, in general. If this works, he is hoping that it could help in the development and acquisition of new communications solutions, as well as other new capabilities, including low-cost satellite networks , which could broadly help the service expand its ability to share information and reduce the vulnerability of these critical data-sharing networks to both physical and non-kinetic attacks. “We’re making it up as we go, right? There’s never been anything like this,” Roper said at the Defense Writers Group breakfast, according to Defense News . “We need a way for people to propose connections and get into the pipeline.” “The good news about that is [that Congress and the Pentagon] don’t really have to believe us for very long,” he continued. “Just let us get through a few connect-a-thon cycles and if we’re failing miserably, then that should tell you something about the future of the program.” If the GatewayOne effort proves successful it could be an extremely important step forward for how F-22s and F-35s, along with the XQ-58A, work with each other, as well as other U.S. military assets. This, in turn, could have a significant impact on how American forces share information across the battlefield, in general.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 29, 2020",Master Chart Showing US Military Aircraft And Their Data-Links Includes RQ-170 Sentinel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military rightly understands that the rapid transfer of information across the battlefield can give American forces a decided edge against its opponents. Over the years, the different services have adopted a variety of manned and unmanned aircraft with increasingly advanced communications gear and data-links, but haven’t always upgraded older types, creating a complex web of different systems that often can’t “talk” to each other directly. Now we at The War Zone have discovered a single master diagram that offers an amazingly granular picture of how various U.S. military combat and combat support aircraft, including the secretive RQ-170 Sentinel drone , can or can’t communicate. U.S. Air Force Major Michael Smith included the chart, titled “Integrated Airborne/Ground Net Enabled Warfare, Version 5.2” and dated May 2017, in a briefing he presented at the National Defense Industry Association’s Precision Strike Annual Review on March 20, 2018. Smith is the Chief of Weapons and Tactics for the 720th Special Tactics Group , which is part of Air Force Special Operations Command and oversees the bulk of the special tactics airmen assigned to that command. These individuals include Combat Controllers, Joint Tactical Air Controllers, and others, who variously coordinate air strikes and air drops, manage airfield operations and communications at austere locations, and often assist with mission planning, among various other specialized duties. It’s no surprise special tactics personnel have to have a good working understanding of the communications and data sharing capabilities of various aircraft. Prominently at the top of the chart are depictions of what aircraft have one of three common data links, Link 16 , Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and Variable Message Format (VMF). On U.S. military aircraft, Link 16 eclipses the use of both SADL and VMF and the diagram notes that there are plans to add Link 16 capability to more than a dozen in-service types, such as the Marine Corps AH-1Z gunship helicopters and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors and the entire U.S. Army special operations helicopter fleet , between the 2017 and 2020 fiscal years. The chart US Air Force Major Smith included in his March 2018 briefing, which has a number of immediately obvious errors, such as the “KC-135J” and “MQ-1C Predator,” but still has a wealth of other information., USAF Some aircraft are equipped with both Link 16 and SADL, though. The U.S. Air Force’s KC-135 aerial tankers , which need to be able to communicate with a variety of different types of aircraft, have both capabilities. After they receive their updates, the Army’s specialized AH-6 and MH-6 Little Birds, MH-60 Black Hawks , and MH-47 Chinooks will all have a dual capability, as will did the older Beechcraft King Air Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System ( MARSS ) spy planes. The Army has replaced the latter type with the MC-12S Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System ( EMARSS ), though U.S. Special Operations Command continues to operate a number of the MARSS aircraft . There are plans to add Link 16 to the AC-130W Stinger II gunships and MC-130J Commando II special operations transports, though the AC-130J Ghostriders already have this functionality, as well as a VMF link, according to the chart. Though not featured here, it’s worth noting that the pair of heavily modified OV-10G+ Bronco light attack aircraft that U.S. Speical Operations Command evaluated in Iraq in 2015 had Link 16, SADL, and VMF, too. The only aircraft with only Link 16 and VMF are various foreign types, such as the Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon , which American special operations airmen might come into contact with during coalition operations. According to the chart, AC-130J Ghostrider gunships, such as the one seen here, have Link 16, SADL, and VMF data links., USAF Of particular interest is the inclusion of the top secret RQ-170, which the U.S. military has released very little information about since it officially acknowledged its existence in 2009. According to this chart, it is one of the few aircraft that carries Link 16 and SADL, though it’s not entirely clear why it would need both systems. We do know that the Air Force has employed Sentinels for persistent surveillance in denied areas and in an overwatch role supporting forces on the ground, and has considered using them for bomb damage assessment in high-risk scenarios. Having both systems could give them added flexibility to communicate with other aircraft and ground-based elements. But neither of these data links are stealthy in nature, but the RQ-170 could use them passively, sucking up their transmissions and sending that information around the world via its low-probability of intercept (LPI) microwave SATCOM communications systems. When operating over lower threat territory, it could use Link 16 and SADL actively for two-way data exchanges. And clearly, the Sentinel possesses other classified communications capabilities that are not featured on this chart. If the aircraft’s had both of those data links installed since its official disclosure, the security of those systems might have been compromised following the crash of a Sentinel in Iran 2011. In addition to attempting to reverse engineer the design , the Iranians allowed their foreign partners, namely the Russians and the Chinese, to closely examine the largely intact aircraft. An RQ-170 Sentinel., USAF via FOIA It’s worth pointing out that the chart makes little mention of stealthy data links at all, only listing the F-35’s stealthy Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) and the F-22’s unique Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL) specifically. At the same time, the B-2 Spirit and the future B-21 Raider stealth bombers are simply listed as having Link 16 connectivity. The Air Force plans to integrate the F-35’s MADL onto the B-2 and the B-21 will get the same. On top of that, we know that the F-35 has full Link 16 capability. Creative tactics could allow for it to be used even while operating in stealth mode by passing information over a MADL’s directional ‘daisy chain’ and then having the F-35 farthest from the leading-edge of combat rebroadcast that data in Link 16 waveform for other aircraft to exploit. Lockheed slide The F-22 also has Link 16, but with receive-only capability. The F-15C’s ‘Talon HATE’ pod aims to connect the F-22 with Link 16 and the outside ‘tactical world’ at large. The chart, however, incorrectly says F-16s carry this system. The Ku-band satcom section only mentions the MQ-1 Predator , MQ-1C Gray Eagle , and MQ-9 Reaper drones, despite many more aircraft, such as AC-130 gunships and MC-130 special operations transports, having this type of connectivity. The RQ-170 is also missing, but this is unsurprising as it is not publically known exactly what type of SATCOM system it uses. Lockheed Martin converted this U-2S Dragon Lady into a flying communications hub for the U.S. Air Force on an experimental basis., USAF Strategic reconnaissance, communications, and command and control platforms, such as the U-2S Dragon Lady , RC-135V/W Rivet Joint , E-4B Nightwatch , E-6B Mercury , and VC-25A Air Force One aren’t on the chart, either, though this isn’t surprising as it is highly unlikely that a JTAC or combat controller would find themselves working with those types. That also explains the section on the right side dedicated to portable data links, such as Handheld Link 16 and even 4G LTE-enabled devices, that those same individuals would be carrying. Also conspicuously absent are the E-11A manned and EQ-4B unmanned Battlefield Airborne Communication Node (BACN) aircraft. These powerful communications hubs serve as an important go-between for aircraft and ground units equipped with one data link and another otherwise incompatible type. They allow ground forces, planes, and helicopters with disparate data-links, like Link 16 and SADL, to share information, and they drastically extend the range and fidelity of those communications, especially over rough terrain. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jN-dljp6k_I But despite what it might leave out, this chart is still an extremely interesting and valuable resource.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 6, 2019",V-22 Ospreys Still At Risk From Sand And Dust As Navy Attempts Third Engine Filter Redesign,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s top watchdog has released a report that offers new details and insights into the U.S. Navy’s struggle to resolve long-standing issues with the Engine Air Particle Separators, or EAPSs, on U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force V-22 Osprey tilt-rotors. This includes the revelation that there was never any requirement for the EAPS design to meet specifications from Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer of the aircraft’s two engines, to ensure proper operation in all desert conditions. EAPS failures, and by extension instances of catastrophic engine power loss and other serious issues, have been factors in a number of fatal Osprey crashes in the past decade. The Navy is on its third attempt to redesign the separators, and now the entire engine inlet configuration, in as many years. There are concerns that it may still not be able to ensure that its latest effort will adequately reduce the risks of V-22s sucking up dangerous amounts of particulate matter, especially when operating in desert environments. The Department of Defense’s Inspector General published the final report of its review of Navy EAPS redesign efforts on Nov. 7, 2019, but only released a redacted copy publicly on Nov. 12. The service initiated the latest project to improve the particle separators on the Ospreys last year. It had made two attempts to solve the issues in 2010 and 2011, but “determined that neither redesign was a viable option,” according to the watchdog’s report. The Navy is the lead service for the V-22 program overall and the Osprey Joint Program Office is part of Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). “The third EAPS redesign is intended to remove more soil from the air flowing into the V‑22 engine than the original EAPS; however, the soil ingested into the engine would be four times greater than the engine manufacturer’s specification allows,” the report explains in its executive summary. “As a result, the V‑22 remains at risk despite more than nine years of EAPS redesign attempts.” Both Marine MV-22s and Air Force CV-22s – which reached initial operational capability in 2007 and 2009, respectively – have a pair of Rolls-Royce T406 engines, also known as the AE 1107C-Liberty, which drive their two huge propellers. Each engine has an EAPS, which, in principle, is supposed to use a vacuum force to pull soil and other particulate matter out of the airstream before it gets inside. There is no indication that the engine/EAPS configuration is different on Japan’s V-22s or on the Navy’s own forthcoming CMV-22 variant . DODIG Ospreys produce an absolutely massive amount of rotor wash during short and vertical takeoffs and landings with their engines tilted upward. The blast is so strong that when Marines rushed to Nepal in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake there in 2015, their MV-22s had to avoid certain landing zones for fear of knocking over already weakened structures nearby. It can also throw up an immense amount of soil, sand, and dust, often enveloping the aircraft, creating what is called a Reduced Visibility Landing situation, or RVL. That material can reduce the amount of air getting to the engine, which can lead to a loss of power. If it gets sucked up inside, it can adhere to fan blades, case walls, and more, potentially leading to more serious issues. Sands with high alkali metal concentrations are particularly dangerous as they can melt in the heat of the engine and actually fuse to sensitive parts. DODIG EAPS problems, especially when combined with operations in sandy environments, have been linked to a number of serious and sometimes fatal accidents. This includes a notable MV-22 crash in Hawaii in May 2015 that killed two Marines and injured 20 more. The official accident investigation blamed pilot error, though it also recommended developing a new air filter and changing regulations to further reduce the maximum amount of time Ospreys could remain hovering inside a dust cloud from 60 to 35 seconds. The new Inspector General report underscores that problems with the EAPS, and subsequent impacts on the engines, have been well known since at least 2010, when the first attempt was made to redesign the system. At that time, the Navy expected the engines on the Ospreys to each run for about 500 flight hours before personnel on the ground would need to swap them out. The service had found that, in reality, this could be as low as 200 hours for V-22s flying regularly in desert conditions. A Marine MV-22 lands in a dust cloud., USMC At that time, the U.S. military had already been involved in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, where sand and dust are common environmental factors, for nearly a decade. The United States remains engaged in those countries, as well as in Syria, a significant part of which is also desert. In addition, between 2008 and 2015, there were also at least eight “engine rapid power loss events” directly attributed to particulate ingestion in the engine. “Although the eight engine rapid power loss events did not result in a catastrophic accident, the engines had degraded to a point where engine failure was possible,” the report notes. It is unclear how many “particulate-induced engine rapid power loss mishaps” V-22s have experienced since 2007, but the Navy says that there have not been any reported since it began implementing other risk mitigation techniques “more than four years ago.” This has included establishing additional limitations on total allowable flight time in sand and dust clouds, improved low engine power warning systems, and updated training regimens. We also don’t know how many other mishaps that did not involve a catastrophic power loss can still be directly attributed to particulate buildup in the engine. Officially, the Osprey has a very good safety record, despite long-standing perceptions to the contrary. The remains of a Marine MV-22 Osprey that suffered what was officially described as a “hard landing” near Creech Air Force Base in Nevada in 2013. The cause of this crash was linked to extensive “engine degradation” as a result of ingestion of particulate matter., USMC via FOIA USMC via FOIA What we do know is that the Navy was aware of the limitations of the EAPS from the very beginning. “When the PMA‑275 [the V-22 Joint Program Office] developed the specification for the original EAPS design, it did not require the EAPS to meet the Rolls‑Royce specification in all desert environments,” the report notes. Beyond that, “PMA‑275 did not include a … specification for the EAPS to define the amount of soil the EAPS would remove from the air, and subsequently the concentration of soil that would remain in the air and be ingested into the V‑22 engine.” So, in 2010, the Navy hired the Bell-Boeing team behind the V-22 to develop an interim improved EAPS with better performance. The next year, with that first effort still ongoing, the service handed them another contract to craft a more lasting solution that would meet Rolls-Royce’s specifications. “Initial flight testing of the first EAPS redesign resulted in inconsistent results,” according to the Pentagon’s Inspector General. “For example, one test showed an improvement in the amount of time that the engines could operate in desert environments, while another test showed a decrease.” The second effort was beset by delay and difficulties and the Navy finally canceled it altogether in December 2017. The following year, the service again hired Bell and Boeing to initiate a third redesign program, which is still ongoing. A Marine MV-22 sits on the ground at an undisclosed location in Syria., USMC The Pentagon’s Inspector General is also warning that the Navy may not know whether the third EAPS redesign truly works in the end, either, because the service is not planning to test it against all types of representative material that Opsreys might encounter. None of the soil samples in the test plan, at present, include all three of the major components found around the world. “The composition of the soils that exist worldwide include three main components: sand, silt, and clay,” the report explains. “For example, one soil composition the PMA‑275 intends to use to test the third EAPS redesign is 0.0‑percent sand, 100.0‑percent silt, and 0.0‑percent clay and another is 100.0‑percent sand, 0.0‑percent silt, and 0.0‑percent clay.” The Navy challenged that assertion, saying that the particulate matter it will use in forthcoming tests of the new separator system will produce the same kind of impacts as real-world soil compositions. The service has also challenged the Inspector General’s core finding that it did not develop an EAPS that meets Rolls-Royce’s specifications, but has, in doing so, highlighted a larger issue. The argument is that it cannot be faulted for not doing this because, given the limitations that Osprey’s present design impose, it is simply not technically possible to do so without a significant rework of major components. The main problems revolve around the engine inlet design and the reality that the Osprey has significantly different engine airflow requirements and parameters when operating in as a traditional aircraft from when it is hovering like a helicopter. The second EAPS redesign program specifically found that installing air filters that would be able to provide adequate protection while in hover mode prevented the engine from getting enough air in airplane mode. The Navy, in cooperation with U.S. Special Operations Command and the Air Force, is presently in the midst of completely redesigning the engine inlets on the Ospreys as part of its third EAPS redesign effort. The Improved Inlet Solution (IIS) dates back to at least 2014, based on heavily redacted documents the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, something not mentioned in the Inspector General’s report. The scope of the IIS work has already led to “cascading effects” on cost as new issues have emerged, including the need for additional anti-icing features around a new auxiliary nacelle door that allows for additional airflow while the V-22 cruises like an airplane. USN USN The Navy also says, rightly, that it is unreasonable to assume that any aircraft will be able to operate without issue for protracted periods of time in sandy, dusty, and similar environments and that its holistic approach to mitigating the risks was not taken into account. The service has also said in the past that these issues are of limited concern, in general, because pilots typically spend 10 seconds or less in these risky conditions. At the same time, the service has repeatedly downplayed these issues despite knowing their very real impacts and has often blamed serious mishaps on pilot error first and foremost. “A proper risk assessment should have prompted the pilots to choose an alternate flight profile, path or landing site that would have minimized or avoided the severe brownout conditions,” the Marine Corps said in a statement after the release of the investigation into the 2015 Hawaii crash. When and if Marine and Air Force V-22s receive the new IIS kit remains to be seen. The Navy says that it expects to complete an initial evaluation of the new system using static engine test rigs next year. The “data will inform updates to the IIS system specification prior to preliminary design review,” the service added in its response to the Inspector General’s findings and recommendations. In the meantime, those services will continue flying Ospreys that have EAPS installed that the Navy knows have limited effectiveness and not only do not, but cannot conform to Rolls-Royce’s specifications.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 4, 2019",U.S. Troops Reportedly Caught Up In Turkish Artillery Attack In Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but a report has emerged that U.S. special operations forces working with the predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, have found themselves under attack from the Turkish military in northeastern Syria . Turkey launched a major operation into the area, targeting the U.S.-backed forces, just two days ago. This incident comes shortly after U.S. Army General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that authorities in Turkey knew where American personnel were situated “down to explicit grid coordinate” in order to avoid such mistakes. Newsweek was first to report that American forces had gotten caught in the fighting on Oct. 11, 2019, citing unnamed Pentagon and Iraqi Kurdish officials with knowledge of the situation. The U.S. special operators were reportedly occupying a position on Mashtenour Hill in the Syrian city of Kobane, which sits right on the other side of the border with Turkey, when Turkish forces began shelling the area. It is unclear, at the time of writing, whether any U.S. personnel suffered any injuries. ISIS terrorists notably laid siege to Kobani in 2014. U.S.-backed local forces, with significant help from American and other U.S.-led coalition aircraft, were able to liberate the city the following year “The Turkish military is fully aware – down to explicit grid coordinate detail – of the locations of U.S. forces,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley had said at a press conference earlier on Oct. 11, 2019. Ahead of the beginning of Turkey’s intervention, which Ankara is calling Operation Peace Spring, at least one U.S. outpost had raised an American flag in place of one representing the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, also known as the YPG, the group that has provided the bulk of the manpower for the SDF. A map showing the general location of Kobane within Syria., Google Maps A map of Kobane giving a sense of just how close it is to the Turkish border., Google Maps There have been conflicting reports of how many U.S. personnel may be in the path of Operation Peace Spring and how many may have already relocated to safer areas to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. Standing beside General Milley at the press conference, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had said that less than 50 special operations forces had withdrawn from “ two small outposts ” near the Syrian-Turkish border. U.S. officials had previously told reporters than anywhere from 15 to 100 personnel had moved to other locations further away from the fighting. It’s also not clear how directly connected troops still in the field are to commander centers with their own links to Turkish forces, who would be able to help bring a halt to any inadvertent attacks.

This is not why we are in Syria.” It is important to note that U.S. forces had been very visible working to keep the SDF separate from Turkish forces, as well as Turkish-supported groups in Syria, known collectively as the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army , or TFSA, since 2017 . If the reports of U.S. personnel still occupying positions in Kobani are true, it would indicate that at least some American forces remain well within the areas where Turkey is now prosecuting Operation Peace Spring. It may also reflect the difficulty U.S. forces could easily be having in exfiltrating from those areas now as the Turkish operation has expanded. It could be increasingly precarious for American troops to use established road networks at present and it might be too dangerous for helicopters or other aircraft to fly in and extract them with risking an accidental confrontation. U.S. personnel have been relying, at least in part, on contractor-operated helicopters for mobility in the region and casualty evacuation services , highlighting how detached many of these positions in Syria are from traditional support chains.

There are reports that about half of the 2,000 American personnel that had been in the country at the end of 2018 are now gone. U.S. personnel do clearly continue to be embedded with the SDF counterpart or otherwise occupy positions nearby. Regardless, this is one of the exact scenarios that experts and observers had warned could happen after U.S. President Donald Trump at least tacitly approved Turkey’s cross-border operation in a call with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 6, 2019. There is also the risk that U.S. forces in Syria may find themselves stuck in between a host of other hostile parties, including forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his allies Russia and terrorists, such as ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria , who may try to take advantage of the increasingly chaotic situation. There have already been reports that the SDF is now refocusing its efforts away from fighting ISIS in order to respond to the Turkish incursion and that the U.S.-led campaign against the terrorists may have effectively come to a halt. To clarify: this is all counter ISIS operations in Syria by SDF and the coalition – ""we are all hunkered down."" ISR is focused on force protection. https://t.co/jymhG1Ptaa — Lara Seligman (@laraseligman) October 9, 2019 In the meantime, there is no indication that the U.S. military has any intention of attempting to intervene in the still very much developing conflict between Turkey and the SDF, despite calls for a no fly zone from America’s erstwhile Syrian partners. Esper and Milley both said that they saw no sign that the Turkish government was looking to slow down their operation, either, despite calls from the United States and others for a ceasefire and a return to an agreed-upon security mechanism that had been in place less than a week ago. Some U.S. lawmakers are now pushing for an American arms embargo and other sanctions against Turkey. A number of European nations have also been making similar diplomatic appeals , with Norway, another NATO member, going so far as to put its own arms embargo into place . Finland has done the same, which could impact ammunition supplies to the Turkish military. It remains to be seen whether or not this incident in Kobane was an aberration and how it might further impact U.S. policy regarding the situation. Trump himself has made vague threats to respond harshly, including that he would “destroy and obliterate the [Turkish] Economy,” if he believes Ankara is not proceeding in a way that he believes is appropriate. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 5:15pm EST— Turkey now says that the artillery strikes were in response to attacks from what they calling a “YPG/PKK” position just over half a mile south of the U.S. outpost in question.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 23, 2020",The Movie Star Ripsaw Mini-Tank Has Reemerged Unmanned And Packing A Big 30mm Cannon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Howe and Howe Technologies has unveiled the latest variant of their Ripsaw, a line of tracked vehicles that look ripped straight from a G.I. Joe playset – 2013’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation even featured an earlier model. The company hopes that the M5 model could meet the U.S. Army’s requirements for future unmanned ground vehicles , including semi-autonomous “wingmen” to support its future, larger optionally-manned combat vehicles . The Maine headquartered company, now a division of defense contractor Textron, revealed the M5 at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual convention in Washington, D.C., which opened on Oct. 14, 2019. The vehicle is the firm’s entry for what the Army is presently calling the Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) program, which envisions a vehicle between 10 and 20 tons. A lighter-weight derivative of this design could be a contender for the smaller, sub-10-ton Robotic Combat Vehicle-Light (RCV-L). The RCV “campaign plan,” which also includes requirements for a 20 to 30 ton “heavy” design, is part of the service’s over-arching Next-Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) effort. Howe and Howe is also competing for the Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) program contract with its much smaller Grizzly tracked unmanned ground vehicle, too. Geoff and Mike Howe began developing the first Ripsaw back in 2000 and they have been developing increasingly updated iterations ever since, including unmanned and driver-optional designs . With their angular central bodies and rubberized band tracks , the vehicles have all shared a general and very distinctive look. This, combined with speeds of up to 65 miles per hour on early, stripped-down examples helped Howe and Howe captured significant media attention over the years, including the aforementioned appearance in G.I. Joe: Retaliation . Ripsaws also appeared in Fast and Furious 8: Fate of the Furious and Mad Max: Fury Road , among other productions, as well as television shows, such as Jay Leno’s Garage . The U.S. Army has also acquired a number of iterations of this miniature tank over the years and used them in a variety of tests, including for research and development of semi-autonomous vehicle operation. These previous military Ripsaws have also included armed examples, but with lighter weaponry, such as M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Stations ( CROWS ) with .50 caliber M2 machine guns and Javelin anti-tank missile launchers . Howe and Howe even demonstrated a variant with M5 Modular Crowd Control Munitions (MCCM), an obscure less-than-lethal cousin of the M18A1 Claymore directional anti-personnel mine that has a smaller explosive charge and rubber pellets instead of steel balls, mounted on the sides for riot control missions. An earlier Ripsaw variant the Army acquired, at right, along with one of Howe and Howe’s Grizzly unmanned ground vehicles ., US Army “It’s very easy engineering-wise to move the Ripsaw into the heavier scale and completely fulfill the requirements for the medium and then downscale to the light,” Geoff Howe, Howe and Howe’s Senior Vice President, told reporters, according to Military.com . The M5’s “DNA sits right smack dab in the center of the two requirements.” The M5 that the company showed off at the AUSA show is approximately 10 tons, even with its turret, which is very similar in appearance to the one found on the Army’s up-gunned 8-wheeled M1296 Stryker Dragoon . Howe and Howe’s miniature “tank” has the same 30mm XM813 Bushmaster main gun, as a result, making it a very well-armed vehicle for its weight. It features a FLIR systems TacFLIR 280-HD sensor turret on top, which includes electro-optical and infrared cameras. There is also a digital sighting system in the turret itself. The M5’s TacFLIR 280-HD sensor turret., FLIR Systems Howe and Howe and FLIR Systems also teamed up to enable the M5 demonstrator to deploy its own smaller unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. An R80D Skyraider small quadcopter type drone can take off from and land on top of the vehicle and this newest iteration of the Ripsaw features a built-in bay in the front hull with a fold-down ramp for a Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV), which is typically used for explosive ordnance disposal and urban scouting missions. These could scout ahead of the Ripsaw, extending the range of its own sensors, or investigate harder to reach areas, including inside buildings. M5s could carry beyond-line-of-sight data links and act as a communications relay to rapidly push information to other friendly forces, giving them a better overall sense of the battlefield around them. This kind of situational awareness is absolutely essential in the extremely dense urban areas, which the U.S. military as a whole has dubbed “ megacities ” and sees as a very likely future operational environment. The M5 on display that AUSA convention showing how it would deploy a SUGV., FLIR Systems This is just one of the possible configurations for the M5, though. Howe and Howe has made it clear that its goal is to offer a modular, scalable system that they can reconfigure relatively easily to meet the Army’s various requirements. This would also make it less labor-intensive to integrate new and improved capabilities as time goes on, including new weapons and defensive systems, such as active protection systems . Improved propulsion and power generation systems are also high on the Army’s list of future capabilities for all of its vehicles in order to help reduce logistical demands, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . An Army infographic showing broad areas of interest for future technologies for manned and unmanned vehicles., US Army “Nobody has ever done that for the U.S. Army before, making it truly scalable, so you can say this mission set requirement is going to be we are going to need a payload of 6,000 pounds, it’s going to need this suspension package, it’s going to deliver this payload at this time,” Howe explained . “Or it’s going to need a 1,000-pound [remote weapons station] system, it’s going to use the same chassis, same suspension components with slight variations and you can scale it down.” In addition to specifying its weight, the Army has described the RCV-M as being a “durable system” that has a robust sensor package and data links in order to help contribute information to build a more accurate “common operational picture,” COP. This would include identifying, categorizing, and geolocating enemy forces and other objects of interest and relaying that information throughout a central network that includes manned vehicles and fixed command and control nodes. It needs to be an unmanned ground vehicle capable of taking on a number of threats by itself using some combination of guns or missiles, too. A US Army briefing slide from earlier in 2019 showing the general desired capabilities for the three size classes of Robotic Combat Vehicles., US Army It could also potentially work as “loyal wingmen” for the Army’s future Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OFMV), which is set to replace the Bradly Fighting Vehicle family, or other vehicles . At present, the service also intends to use teams consisting of a driver and sensor operator to operate any future RCV-M, but does plan to make them increasingly autonomous over time. Still, no matter how independent the vehicles become, the plan is to always have “ assured control ” by having a human operator in the loop. The RCV-L concept is much more of a scout, with weapons only for self-defense. The Army also hopes this design will be “attritable,” or low cost enough that commanders could take greater risks and accept greater losses when employing them. However, this is not a synonym for “expendable” or “disposable.” This is a general concept that is gaining traction throughout the U.S. military for various systems and the U.S. Air Force is investing heavily in the development of similarly attritable unmanned aircraft . It’s not entirely clear what unit price the Army may consider to be suitably low to meet this requirement when it comes to the RCV-L, or how readily Ripsaw may be able to meet it. Previous militarized variants have cost around $750,000 each. An earlier unmanned Ripsaw variant the Army had acquired in the past., US Army The Army expects to begin putting various potential RCV designs through the paces in 2021, two years earlier than it had originally expected. This is in line with aggressive timetables for other future armored vehicle developments, including the OMFV, which the service hopes to begin actually fielding in 2026. With this in mind, we can definitely expect to see more of action movie-esque M5, as well as competing designs, in the coming months as the different RCV programs really begin to heat up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 4, 2019",This Exotic Bullpup Rifle Is Competing To Replace The Army’s M4 Carbines And M249 SAWs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Of the companies competing to build the U.S. Army’s next standard infantry rifle and squad automatic rifle , both of which will use new 6.8mm ammunition , only one offering has a so-called bullpup configuration where the main action is positioned behind the pistol grip. There are benefits to this arrangement, namely the ability to maintain the accuracy that a longer barrel offers in a more compact package, but the U.S. military as a whole has rejected them in the past in favor of more traditional designs. General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) first unveiled its RM277 small arms line at the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual convention in Washington, D.C., which opened on Oct. 14, 2019, and wrapped up today. The Firearms Blog was first to report the guns’ designation, as well as other details about the particular features of the infantry rifle and automatic rifle variants that have emerged so far. However, GD-OTS has been relatively tight-lipped about the weapons, which are competing in the Army’s Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) program, which aims to replace the service’s 5.56mm M4 carbines and M249 Squad Automatic Weapons (SAW). The company told The Firearms Blog that its policy is not to issue formal press releases regarding systems taking part in “an active, open competition.” As noted, the basic design of both RM277 variants is a bullpup with the action, along with the magazine, situated all the way to the rear. They both also feature a large top-mounted rail for optics, night and thermal vision systems, and other accessories. There are back up sights offset to the side and there appear to be attachment points for additional rails on the sides and underneath the forend handguard. The automatic rifle variant, which has a folding bipod, has a slightly longer barrel than the rifle version, but we don’t yet know the exact dimensions of either model. The barrel on the automatic rifle version, intended for more sustained fire, is clearly fluted to reduce weight and help it cool faster. It is possible the one in the basic rifle design is, as well, and it is just not visible. GD-OTS’ RM277 automatic rifle variant, at top, and infantry rifle version, at bottom., GD-OTS via The Firearms Blog Both guns fire a 6.8mm round, with a polymer case rather than a brass one to keep weight down, that ammunition maker True Velocity developed to go along with the guns. All of the NGSW entrants will have to be chambered in this caliber. 6.8mm is roughly .277 caliber, which is the origin of the “277” in the RM277 designation. The U.S. military has been exploring polymer cases for years as a way to reduce how much weight individuals troops have to carry and it has begun to buy such ammunition, and rounds that use hybrid polymer-metal cases, already. These developments are extremely innovative and notable in their own right. True Velocity’s 6.8mm cartridge design., True Velocity The Army has also required that the NGSW submissions come along with a suppressor. GD-OTS has chosen an unusual-looking design from Delta P Design that is shorter and wider than many traditional suppressors to go along with the RM277. Most interestingly, both guns use a novel “gas and recoil-operated, impulse averaged, air-cooled” operating mechanism, according to The Firearms Blog . It’s not entirely clear how the guns function, but the description suggests that they use a combination of physical energy from firing a round, as well as propellant gas siphoned off as the bullet travels down the barrel, to cycle the action. By comparison, the U.S. Army’s standard M4 carbine uses propellant gas alone. A promotional video below shows that the barrel on the RM277 versions moves back and forth during firing, which is indicative of so-called “ long recoil ” designs. Though the basic concept of a long-recoil action has been around for decades, they have become increasingly rare and pairing it together with a gas system would be very unusual. In principle, using a combination of long-recoil and gas-operated action could help mitigate felt recoil, which would improve accuracy, even during fully automatic fire. This could also help keep weight down, by minimizing the force firing each round exerts on the weapon and, in turn, reducing the need for more robust recoil system components. Combining all of this will a bullpup configuration could also ensure maximum barrel length without needing to dramatically increase the overall length of the weapon to accommodate this operating mechanism, as well. It will be interesting to see how the RM277s fare in the NGSW competition. Bullpups offer advantages over traditional designs, including being able to be more compact without necessarily sacrificing barrel length and the associated accuracy that a longer barrel provides. At the same time, the mechanical linkages necessary to connect the trigger in front to the main action behind do not lend themselves to precision fire . In addition, though armorers can configure many designs, including the RM277, to eject cartridge cases from the left or right, to suit left- or right-handed operators, this cannot be done in the field, which can make offhand shooting in complex, constrained environments more difficult than it might already be. Critics have often cited potential difficulties in reloading, especially while lying prone or in otherwise awkward positions. GD-OTS via The Firearms Blog Proponents have countered that sufficient training could mitigate or eliminate many of these concerns, but there continues to be an intense debate over the pros and cons of bullpups versus more traditional configurations. It is worth noting that many national militaries around the world have gone back and forth themselves, with the Chinese just recently introducing a new standard infantry rifle in a conventional configuration after decades of using bullpups. The RM277 designs also have potential maintenance and logistical benefits in that the infantry and automatic rifle variants share the same action, upper and lower receivers, and the vast majority of their other key components. This would reduce the number of unique spare parts and tools necessary to service the guns. The other two NGSW contestants, Textron’s AAI division and Sig Sauer, have each submitted two distinct weapon designs to meet these separate requirements. Their automatic rifle variants are both belt-fed, rather than magazine-fed, as well. You can read more about Textron’s entries in this past War Zone piece . Sig Sauer’s offerings are derived from the company’s increasingly popular MCX line , which is itself a piston derivative of the AR-15/M16 family that the U.S. military already uses. Sig Sauer’s automatic rifle entry, at left, and its infantry rifle design, at right., Sig Sauer How much any of these designs might further evolve as testing gets underway remains to be seen, too. The Army hopes to pick final infantry and automatic weapon designs in 2022 ahead of actually beginning to field the new guns the following year. Regardless, with the RM277 in the competition, there is now the possibility that U.S. Army troops may be starting to use these exotic and unique bullpup rifles and automatic rifles four years now.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has revealed a wind tunnel model for a prospective cargo aircraft, dubbed the “Elephant,” to replace the Soviet-era An-124 Ruslan , or Condor. The Antonov company, which is situated in what is now in Ukraine, with which Russia has particularly poor relations at present, originally built the An-124s. Curiously, the Elephant’s design appears to be significantly different from previous models and artwork of the Ilyushin Il-106 , which that company had said earlier this year was already in development to replace the Ruslans. Russia’s Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, also referred to by its Russian acronym TsAGI, posted a picture of the Elephant wind tunnel model on Nov. 5, 2019. Personnel at the center built the model, which they expect to begin testing the T-106 variable-density wind tunnel soon. Experiments, including exploring potential takeoff and landing performance, is set to continue in the T-106, as well as another wind tunnel known as the T-102, in 2020. TsAGI says that the model is readily reconfigurable, which will allow them to explore various different nose, wingtip, rear fuselage, engine nacelle, and landing gear fairing configurations. It also presently lacks a tail of any kind, though the center said it was looking primarily at a single vertical tail with a two-section rudder, as is found on the An-124. Depending on how it is configured, the model can be, at maximum, just over five feet in length, a little more than a foot and a half high, and have a wingspan that is close to six feet. The aluminum and steel subscale test article can weight up to 264 and a half pounds. The Elephant wind tunnel model., TsAGI However, TsAGI did not give any sense of how large the full-size design this is supposed to be representative of might be in the end. For comparison, the An-124 is nearly 225 feet long, just over 62 feet high, and has a wingspan of 240 and a half feet. The center did offer a few details about the prospective capabilities of the Elephant, saying that Russia was aiming for a design that could carry a maximum payload of 180 tons, 60 tons more than the An-124. The plane would be able to fly up to nearly 4,350 miles at a cruising speed of just under 460 knots. The Ruslan has a typical cruising speed between 430 and 460 knots and a range of around 4,500 miles with a payload of just under 90 tons. A Russian An-124 Ruslan flying in formation with a pair of Flanker fighter jets., Sergey Kustov/Wikicommons TsAGI also says that four PD-35 turbofans would hopefully power the aircraft. This engine is a proposed derivative of the still-in-development Aviadvigatel PD-14, which is itself derived from the PS-90 , a modern high-bypass design found on Russia’s Il-96 and Tu-204/214 airliner families. Those same aircraft have served as the basis for a number of special mission aircraft, including the Il-96-300PU presidential jet , the Tu-214R spy plane , and the Tu-214ON Open Skies surveillance aircraft. As it stands now, the model, as well as TsAGI’s projected specifications for the Elephant, is very reminiscent of the An-124 planform, overall. AviationWeek ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone Steve Trimble also pointed out that it had very broad external similarities to the American Lockheed C-5 Galaxy heavy cargo aircraft, calling it a “Fred-ski.” This is a reference to the C-5’s less-than-polite unofficial nickname “Fred,” which stands for “F*cking Ridiculous Economic/Environmental Disaster.” It is also a visually distinct design from earlier concept models and artwork of the Il-106, which reports have identified in the past as Russia’s An-124 replacement. Development of that aircraft traces back to the 1990s, but reportedly suffered significant setbacks and delays. An artist’s conception of the 1990s Il-106., Ilyushin In 2016, FlightGlobal reported that Ilyushin had recycled the Il-106 designation for a new design, which it was developing as part of what was known at the time as the “prospective aviation complex for military transport aircraft,” abbreviated PAK VTA in Russian. However, in December 2018, the company’s chief designer, Nikolai Talikov, said that the “cargo cabin of the Il-106 will be the same dimension as the Ruslan,” but that it would have “new engines, new avionics, and everything else.” The wind tunnel model would seem to confirm the 2016 report that the present Il-106 has little to no relation to the earlier 1990s aircraft. The exact size of the proposed design remains unclear. Last year, Talikov had described an aircraft that was smaller than the An-124, but still slightly bigger than something like the American Boeing C-17 Globemaster III , a possibility that The War Zone had analyzed in-depth at the time. TsAGI’s descriptions about the Elephant’s projected performance would also seem to suggest that Russia is actually very much looking for a direct An-124 replacement. There’s no indication that there are multiple An-124 replacement efforts in progress, either, though the wind reconfigurable nature of the wind tunnel model would also suggest that the Elephant’s design is far from stable. Whatever the case, the Kremlin has a clear incentive to develop a Russian replacement for the An-124 of some kind, which would eliminate any remaining need to approach Antonov for help with the Ruslans. Relations between Russia and Ukraine have been effectively frozen since 2014, when Russian forces illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimea region and began directly supporting separatists in the eastern Donbass region of the country. Since then, Russia’s An-124 fleets – the Russian Air Force and other arms of the Russian government operate around 24 Ruslans, while the private Volga-Dnepr cargo airline has another 12 – have remained busy in recent years. These aircraft are regularly employed to transport heavy weapons and other equipment in support Russia’s overseas military operations, especially in Syria. The planes were a major component of an air bridge to that country when the Kremlin first kicked off its major intervention there in 2015. They’re continued to be important for resupplying that mission, including bringing in long-range surface-to-air missile systems, such as the S-300 and S-400 , in recent years. https://youtube.com/watch?v=K2ZYOzoZVEM Russia has also used the Ruslans to support non-combat deployments, such as Tu-160 Blackjack heavy bomber visits to Venezuela and South Africa in 2018 and 2019 respectively. The Kremlin employs the government-owned aircraft to deliver weapons from state-run defense companies to allies and partners, as well. An-124s have been helping with the controversial delivery of S-400 systems to Turkey this year, as seen in the video below. Persevering the capability that the An-124s offer will be key to ensuring the Russian military, as well as the Russian government, can continue with these sorts of overseas activities in the future, which are increasingly important to the country’s foreign policy ambitions. Russia is also looking to expand its military presence both in more remote areas within its borders, particularly its strategic Arctic regions , and elsewhere, where heavy airlift capabilities will be vital. Thou Russia’s economy is undeniably better than it was in the 1990s, questions still remain about whether the Kremlin has the resources necessary to support the development of the new Il-106. International sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, as well as the Kremlin’s involvement in Syria, have had real impacts and Russian defense spending has contracted to a degree. At the same time, the Kremlin has made it clear that it is still very willing to continue to invest the resources it does have in projects that it sees as particularly important to its overall strategic aims. This has included a new order for 76 Su-57 Felon advanced combat jets, progress on the development of the S-70 Okhotnik-B unmanned combat air vehicle, and a slew of nuclear-armed strategic weapons, including hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , new intercontinental ballistic missiles , and nuclear-powered doomsday cruise missiles and long-range torpedoes . Though relatively low-density, the existing An-124 fleet has clearly proven its worth and would seem to support the idea that developing a replacement is a worthwhile expenditure of limited time and funds. The wind tunnel model at TsAGI indicates that Russia is definitely moving ahead with at least one program to develop a successor design. Last year, Talikov said that the Kremlin was hoping to see the rollout of the first Il-106 sometime between 2025 and 2026. How close the final Elephant design might be to An-124, or the Il-106 proposals, and whether Russia will be able to keep to this schedule, remains to be seen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two Russian Tu-160 Blackjack bombers touched down today at South African Air Force Base Waterkloof in the country’s capital Pretoria, marking the first time these bombers have made a visit to anywhere in Africa. This comes on the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin opened the first-ever Russia Africa Summit in Sochi on the Black Sea and as the Kremlin has been working to expand its influence across the continent. South African authorities announced the Russian Air Force would be sending the bombers on Oct. 21, 2019, and described the deployment as a military-to-military cooperation event. The Tu-160s were supposed to arrive yesterday, but experienced unspecified technical issues , which pushed their trip back a day. Bad weather further delayed when they would actually land at Waterkloof. An An-124 cargo plane and an Il-62 passenger transport aircraft did make the trip as scheduled on Oct. 22, 2019, carrying supporting personnel and equipment. This is a typical support package for the Blackjacks that also accompanied a pair of bombers on a trip to Venezuela in December 2018. “The RSA [Republic of South Africa] and Russian Federation have strong historical links with diplomatic relations established between both countries on February 28, 1992,” an official South African Defense Department press release said on Oct. 23, 2019. “The ‘Military to Military’ relations between the two countries is not solely built on struggle politics, but rather on fostering mutually beneficial partnerships based on common interests.” It is worth noting that South Africa abolished its racist apartheid system that ensured White minority rule in 1991, but only held its first post-apartheid elections with universal suffrage in 1994. A year later, the new South African government, under the leadership of President Nelson Mandela, signed an agreement formalizing military-to-military ties with Russia. Russia and South African military officials speak to the press at Waterkloof on Oct. 23, 2019., SANDF SANDF SANDF SANDF For the Russians, the deployment is a visible demonstration of the country’s ability to conduct military operations far from its own territorial borders. Russia has already been conducting an increasing number of long-range patrols, including using strategic bombers such as the Tu-160 and the Tu-95MS Bear , in the strategic Arctic and Pacific regions in recent years, highlighting these capabilities. Some of the missions in the Pacific have been in cooperation with China , underscoring how the Kremlin has been looking to engage more and more regularly with its partners around the world more directly. This was also seen in the deployment of the two Tu-160s to Venezuela in 2018, which involved a combined Russian-Venezuelan patrol in the Caribbean Sea lasting some ten hours . The exact route the nuclear-capable strategic bombers took to South Africa, and how many times they needed to refuel in midair, is unclear. It was reportedly one intended specifically to demonstrate the Blackjack’s range capabilities. “I have been told that the Tu-160s are taking a longer route that’s almost entirely over the ocean,” Darren Olivier, the Director of African Defense Review who was the first to call attention to the Russian Air Force’s visit, wrote on Twitter. “A similar strategy was followed when Russia sent a pair of Tu-160s to Venezuela a few years ago. Shows impressive range.” It is very possible, if not probable that we will soon see the Tu-160s flying with South African combat aircraft, potentially on a major, long-duration patrol, near the Antarctic region. South African Air Force Gripen fighter jets and Hawk jet trainers were supposed to escort the Tu-160s to Waterkloof, but it is unclear if the Gripens actually participated in the event. Hawks did greet the bombers and accompanied them to the South African base. Regardless, as with the Tu-160s’ visit to Venezuela last year, the arrival of the Blackjacks at Waterkloof is also a very visible display of the warm relations between Russia and South Africa. African Defense Review’s Olivier said that there had been plans for such a visit in 2016, but that the Russian Air Force scrapped the deployment due to operational demands relating to the conflict in Syria. It’s not clear why this would have impacted the Tu-160s, which have seen very limited use in that conflict compared to other types , but there may have been other personnel and logistical constraints at the time, especially in terms of airlift capacity. Now, ironically thanks to the delays, the bombers’ arrival is even more symbolic. Earlier in the day, at the first-of-its-kind Russia Africa Summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met with Putin. “While in Russia, President Ramaphosa is expected to attend the inaugural Russia-Africa Economic Forum, have bilateral meetings with President Vladimir Putin of Russia and other Heads of State and Government attending the summit,’ Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement ahead of the trip. These “discussions … are framed by three thematic pillars, namely, forging economic ties, creating joint projects, and collaborating in the humanitarian and social sector,” according to the official South African Government News Agency . South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, in the foreground at left, across from his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at the first Russia-Africa Summit on Oct. 23, 2019., Ramil Sitdikov / Sputnik  via AP “We see how an array of Western countries are resorting to pressure, intimidation and blackmail of sovereign African governments,” Putin had told the Russian state-run news agency TASS on Oct. 21, 2019. In recent years, the Kremlin has been using debt forgiveness and generously financed sales of weapons and other military equipment, among other mechanisms , to expand its influence across Africa. Trade overall with African countries was worth approximately $20 billion in 2018 to the the Russian Federation, nearly four times what it was a decade earlier. The Kremlin has also reportedly employed some of its hybrid warfare strategies to try to ensure that pro-Russian leaders in various countries remain in power. Last year, there were reports that the ostensibly independent Russian private military company Wagner, which has close ties to Russian intelligence agencies if it is not taking orders from them directly, was working with the government of the Central African Republic (CAR). That country has been in the midst of civil strife since 2012, but the government reached a deal with a number of armed groups in February of this year, though there are reports that fighting continues . “Heavy weapons are necessary for us to create effective forces,” CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera said in his own meeting with Putin at the Summit in Sochi, where he also thanked Russia for its previous military assistance and asked the Kremlin to help get a U.N. arms embargo on his country lifted entirely. “Armed groups get heavy weapons by circumventing the embargo and that is why we cannot control the territory of the whole country.” Russia has also made recent arms deliveries to Mozambique , including Mi-17 helicopters equipped with the President-S directional infrared countermeasure system, sometimes misidentified as sensor turrets, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . There are also reports of shadowy Russian mercenary groups, such as Wagner, being present. This country is also experiencing an outburst of political violence that observers fear could lead to a larger civil conflict . Secretive Russian military contractors may have also tried to intervene on behalf of former Sudanese dictator Omar Al Bashir, who is now in prison following a coup in April 2019 that occurred in the midst of popular protests against him. The Kremlin also has strong ties to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar , who launched an assault on that country’s internationally recognized government earlier this year . These are just some of the inroads that Russia has been looking to make across the continent in recent years, spurred on in part by what appears to be waning U.S. government interest under President Donald Trump. The U.S. military notably announced last year that it would be significantly drawing down its African commitments. In the end, Russia’s real competitor, in this case, may be China, which has already established significant ties throughout Africa, including the establishment of a major military outpost in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti in 2017. The Chinese government also notably financed the construction of the African Union’s present headquarters, which opened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 2012. Beijing has denied reports that it also installed covert surveillance equipment in the building while Chinese construction companies were building it. Still, the deployment of the two Tu-160s to South Africa certainly sends a very loud signal that the Kremlin remains invested in that country and continues to be interested in expanding its ties across the continent, as a whole. UPDATE: 3:50pm EST— TV Zvezda , an official outlet of the Russian Ministry of Defense, says that the Tu-160s flew approximately 6,835 miles over the course of some 13 hours to get to South Africa, flying over the Caspian and Arabian Seas, as well as the Indian Ocean. A separate report from TASS says that the flight lasted only 12 hours and also saw the bombers fly through the national air spaces of seven different unspecified African countries. UPDATE: 10/24/2019— African Defense Review’s Darren Olivier has said that the discrepancies between the TV Zvezda and TASS reports may be confusion over the over-sea route that the two Tu-160s took with the overland route that the An-124 and Il-62 followed to get to South Africa. He has also offered additional clarification regarding Russia’s decision not to make this deployment in 2016.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 14, 2019",Potentially The Most Revolutionary Aircraft You Have Never Heard Of Has Flown,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last couple of years, virtually nobody has reported on the mysterious and bizarre-looking, but potentially revolutionary flying machine known as the Otto Aviation Celera 500L aside from The War Zone . Well, that is until our most recent article on the aircraft from June of 2019. That piece went viral, but nobody that we know of has followed up with any new information on the remarkably secretive civilian aircraft or the extremely shy firm that built it. Now, based on first-hand reports and images we have seen, we can state that the exotic, bullet-shaped flying machine has successfully taken to the skies. Before we proceed, take a moment and read about the Celera 500L in order to get up to speed on its proposed capabilities. Suffice it to say, the aircraft is all about shattering the traditional concepts and economies of commercial and private air travel and more. Word of the aircraft being finally spotted in the air near its Victorville, California home came early last week. A few days later, actual images of the unmistakable airframe flying with a twin-prop chase plane in tow surfaced. It isn’t clear if this was the plane’s actual first flight, but it is the first we or anyone I have talked to knows about. Considering how unique the plane looks and its commercial airport home, it’s hard to imagine it has been flying for any considerable amount of time without anyone noticing. SOCAL AIRSHOW REVIEW Now the big question is, when will Otto Aviation actually say anything about the aircraft that is basically their reason for being. Usually successful first flights are something to be grandly promoted and are a huge validation of so much tireless work by the project’s team, yet this endeavor seems to have been run in a manner far more akin to a secretive military aircraft project than a potentially transformative civil aviation one. Hopefully this highly intriguing plane and the people that built it come out of the shadows soon, but regardless, the Celera 500L is now a very real flying machine.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 8, 2020",Mysterious Laser Turret Appears On US Navy Destroyer USS Dewey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A photo from one of our awesome commenters, James Milliken, shows the American Arleigh Burk e class destroyer USS Dewey (DDG-105) outfitted with a new turreted system installed on its forward close-in weapon system pedestal—an area usually left open on the majority of Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyers. The image was taken in San Diego very recently. The use of Dewey for integrating new technologies isn’t surprising. The ship has been used to test cutting edge capabilities, like the temporarily installed Laser Weapon System (LaWS) and the firing of Hyper-Velocity Projectiles , although what we are seeing in the image above is a far more permanent capability. The installation looks most like renderings of Lockheed’s HELIOS laser system, which is set to be installed in that position on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer for its initial fielding, but that is supposed to be at least a couple of years out from occurring. The Ruggedized High Energy Laser (RHEL), a similar effort, is also in the works, but the installation of such a highly integrated system at this time also seems outside of that program’s schedule. HELIOS concept image., Lockheed Martin The Navy has three other shipboard laser programs underway beyond these two as part of its Navy Laser Family of Systems (NLFoS) initiative and its periphery programs. Just last month, The War Zone was first to report that Northrop Grumman shipped its Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) system to San Diego under curious circumstances. It will be installed on the amphibious transport dock USS Portland for trials. High Energy Laser Counter-ASCM Program (HELCAP) is another that looks to leverage the various components of NLFoS to develop a laser system capable of rapidly engaging anti-ship cruise missiles. But, by our analysis, the most likely answer to what we are seeing on Dewey is the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system, which was set to be installed on a Navy destroyer by the end of this year. USS Dewey (DDG-105), USN ODIN is a lower power laser system that will be used to blind enemy electro-optical and infrared sensor systems by shining a modulated “dazzler” laser beam at them in a similar manner as to how directed infrared countermeasure (DIRCM) systems work to defend aircraft from heat-seeking missiles. ODIN will be capable of countering ship and boat-based systems, those used by aircraft and drones, and even those used by anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles. Currently, electronic countermeasures, both expendable, like Nulka decoys, and not, like SLQ-32 SWEIP and the newer shadowy SLQ-59 , are capable at countering radar-guided missiles, but anti-ship missile systems are increasingly using passive infrared guidance , or even a mix of the two, for terminal homing. That leaves those other systems useless against them. A dazzler, on the other hand, could blind these missiles, sending them off course or into the sea as they make their kamikaze attack runs. Anti-ship ballistic missiles, namely those belonging to the Chinese, are posited to use some form of infrared terminal guidance, as well. The Navy has been aggressive about fielding the ODIN system as fast as possible. Two of these systems are scheduled to be installed on destroyers by the end of this year, with six more being fielded, or in the process of being fielded, by the following year. See the 2020 budget documents below for more details about this plan. USN USN USN With only so many places to mount directed energy systems on surface combatants, eventually, a solution that pairs the dazzler and a high-energy kill laser system together may be more ideal. This is the concept behind Lockheed’s HELIOS. On the other hand, a laser can only be pointed at one thing at one time, so it is possible that as the technology miniaturizes, multiple laser dazzlers could be dispersed around a ship to help counter multiple, simultaneous threats. This is similar to what has occurred with DIRCM systems on aircraft. Regardless, it’s clear that the Arleigh Burke class’s striking profile is about to change, with ODIN laser dazzlers being the first directed energy weapons fielded across multiple destroyers.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 14, 2019",Stunning Video And Photos Of Skunk Works Preparing An F-117 For The Reagan Library,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has released a video offering a behind-the-scenes look at the work it has been doing to demilitarize and restore a retired U.S. Air Force F-117 Nighthawk , tail number 803 and nicknamed “Unexpected Guest,” which will eventually be headed for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California. The War Zone was first to report that the Reagan Presidential Library would be getting one of these aircraft in September 2019. The Reagan Presidential Foundation, which manages the Reagan Presidential Library, had also issued a press release earlier this week detailing what it is calling Operation Nighthawk Landing. The Foundation has been working with both the Air Force and Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division, which was responsible for the development of the F-117, to get the jet ready to go on display outside the Library next to its existing F-14 Tomcat fighter jet, one of a number of aircraft in its overall collection. Lockheed Martin’s video confirms shows the F-117 heading to the Skunk Works facilities at Plant 42 in southern California on a flatbed truck. This truck, as well as the orange pickup truck escorting it, is identical to the one that bystanders in that area saw carrying a Nighthawk in mid-August and this all but confirms that the plane they saw was Unexpected Guest. A picture of an F-117 on a flat bed truck near Plant 42 in mid-August 2019. It is extremely likely that this was Unexpected Guest based on the video Lockheed Martin has released., Christopher McGreevy/ @ohwiss When we see the Nighthawk unwrapped in the video, it is “in the white,” indicating that its specialized and highly toxic radar-absorbing skin was removed before leaving storage at the secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport. This is where the remaining fleet of 51 F-117s have been in semi-active storage since their official retirement since 2008. As the War Zone first reported in August , this is also where the Air Force has built a new “media blasting” facility to strip this coating from those jets in preparation to destroy them. The service has set aside a dozen jets to go on display in the future in museums, such as the Reagan Presidential Library and the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. Though “in the white,” Unexpected Guest retained a piece of artwork on one of its main landing gear bay doors bearing its nickname and a depiction of the character Beetlejuice riding a precision-guided bomb through the roof of a building. Beetlejuice first appeared in a movie of the same name in 1988, the same year that the U.S. government officially disclosed the Nighthawk to the public., Lockheed Martin We then get to see an interesting time-lapse of personnel reattaching the wings and installing dummy fittings in place of the radar-absorbing composite fairings that originally lined the jet’s edges. This type of work would also be necessary to remove these sensitive features from other areas of the aircraft, including the exhaust area and tails. Lockheed Martin The entire demilitarization process is complex and time-consuming and also involves stripping out any other sensitive materials and equipment, as well as recovering any parts that might still be useful. You can read more about this in this past War Zone piece . The video then shows the team at Skunk Works priming and painting the jet. Since the aircraft will be on display outside, the mutliple layers of paint are also necessary to seal it against the elements. The scheme it is now waring is what it wore when it was assigned to the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron , the Ghostriders, later known just as the 416th Fighter Squadron, an operational F-117 unit that existed between 1989 and 1993. It also carries the appropriate “TR” tail code for Tonopah Test Range Airport, which is where the unit was based. The 416th was one of the units that brought the F-117 “into the light” after the U.S. government declassified its existence in 1988. The insignia of the 416th Tactical Fighter Wing, the “Ghost Riders,” on F-117 Tail Number 803 following preparations at Plant 42 to send it to the Reagan Presidential Library., Lockheed Martin capture “I was privileged to fly the airplane when the program was classified,” retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Scott Stimpert, who was among the pilots who flew this particular aircraft operationally, said in the Reagan Presidential Foundation’s statement . “It was an exciting time, and a vitally important capability, but not something you could share with friends or family. I’m glad the airplane can come out of the dark to take its rightful place in the light, somewhere it can be seen and appreciated by the people it helped to protect.” During its service life, Unexpected Guest was the most active of the F-117s, flying a total of 78 combat missions, more than all other Nighthawks, including taking part in the type’s combat debut over Panama in 1989, according to the Reagan Presidential Foundation. You can read more about the Nighthawk’s developmental and operational history, as well as about how much of a proponent of the aircraft President Reagan was, in this past War Zone piece .

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2020","Putin Names Ships, Subs That Will Get Shadowy Zircon Hypersonic Missile As Test Date Approaches","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it is upgrading a destroyer and a nuclear-powered guided-missile submarine assigned to its Pacific Fleet so that they will be able to launch the shadowy 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile , also written Tsirkon, when that weapon becomes available. This comes a month after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that a new corvette due to enter service soon would also eventually receive this capability. The Kremlin’s public plans to field these missiles are steadily expanding beyond the Kirov -class battlecruisers , which previous reports had indicated would be the first operational launch platforms, and the first test of the missile from a ship is reportedly set to occur before the end of the year. On Nov. 8, 2019, Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko made the announcement about the updates to the Project 1155 Udaloy class destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov and the Project 949A Oscar II class submarine Irkutsk following visits to shipbuilding enterprises in the country’s Far East region. Marshal Shaposhnikov is due to return to Russia’s Pacific Fleet from its overhaul next year, while Irkutsk is scheduled to go back on active duty in 2022. “In 2020, we are due to receive the upgraded ship Marshal Shaposhnikov . I am confident that the management [of the Dalzavod Ship Repair Center] will duly fulfill the assigned task and the timeframe of the ship’s delivery won’t be shifted,” Krivoruchko said, according to state media outlet TASS . “The universal launchers, which the ship will receive, will enable it to eventually employ the latest Tsirkon hypersonic missiles.” The Project 1155 Udaloy class destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov ., Liu Zheng/Color China Photo/AP Images The universal launcher in question is the 3S-14 vertical launch system, which can presently fire the P-800 Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missile and the Kalibr land-attack cruise missile, among others. Zircon is reportedly sized to fit in these launch cells, as well, making it significantly easier to integrate the weapon onto any surface ship that has or will receive 3S-14s. The upgrades to Irkutsk may be more substantial, as that submarine, at present, has launchers specifically configured for the older and massive P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missile, also known to the United States and NATO as the SS-N-19 Shipwreck . However, the Oscar II class submarines do have their launchers installed in long compartments situated between the boat’s inner and outer hulls on each side, giving them their distinctive wide-bodied hullform. This would provide ample room for the installation of new systems in place of the existing P-700s. An Oscar II class submarine., via Reddit The first-in-class Project 20385 corvette Gremyashchiy , which the Russian Navy expects to formally commission and assign to the Pacific Fleet next month, also has the 3S-14 universal launchers. So, it was perhaps not surprising when Russian President Putin said that “it will certainly have Tsirkon” when he toured the ship during a visit to Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea in October. The first-in-class Project 20385 corvette Gremyashchiy ., Severnaya Verf Russia’s Kirov class nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov is also undergoing a deep refit that will include the installation of 3S-14 arrays. Her sister ship, Pyotr Veliky , or Peter the Great , is set to go in for a similar overhaul once the work on Nakhimov is done. Prior to these more recent announcements, the Russian Navy had identified these ships as among the first ones that would be equipped with Zircon, though it seems to be increasingly unlikely that this will be the case. Nakhimov ‘s time in drydock has been extended more than once and she is scheduled now to rejoin the fleet in 2021. The fielding plan for Zircon will, of course, all depend heavily on how fast Russian can get the weapon itself ready for operational use. The missile, no conclusive pictures of which exist, has reportedly been in development since at least the early 2010s. Russian media routinely uses graphics depicting a so-called “waverider” hypersonic missile , similar to the U.S. Air Force’s X-51 Waverider , when referring to Zircon. Systems in this configuration use rocket booster to propel the actual vehicle to a sufficient altitude and speed, after which its own air-breathing scramjet engine takes over. As its name implies, the waverider configuration is designed to use its own shockwaves to generate additional lift to keep it stable and airborne. One of a number of graphics circulating on the internet purporting to show Zircon., via AINonline Actual details about Zircon, or its capabilities, remain extremely limited. There are unconfirmed reports that the missile may employ a “plasma stealth” system, which would involve creating a close of radar-absorbing ionized particles around all or a portion of the weapon. You can read more about this in this past War Zone feature . Hypersonic weapons already present a major challenge to existing air and missile defense systems given how fast they fly and their ability to rapidly and unpredictably change course on their way to the target. Their high speed also limits the amount of time an opponent has to detect and then react, at all. In February 2019, Putin offered what appeared to be some of the first pieces of substantial information about the weapon when he disclosed that it had a speed of up to Mach 9 and a range of 620 miles. If true, this would mean that Zircon would be able to strike targets out to its maximum range within around just five minutes of launch. At that time, Putin also confirmed that it would be able to strike targets at sea and on land, rather than being a pure anti-ship weapon as earlier reports had indicated. In March 2019, an unnamed Russian defense industry source told TASS that the first test of the missile from an actual ship would occur “at the end of 2019” and that the first-in-class Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov would fire the weapon. It remains to be seen just what Zircon’s capabilities might be when, and if, it finally enters service and just how widely Russia will field the weapon, no matter how many ships and submarines have the ability to fire it. It is certainly true that Zircon is part of a larger modernization effort going on in the Russian military that is largely aimed at challenging the supremacy of near-peer opponents, primarily the United States. By every indication, the program enjoys support at the highest levels, making it less likely to fall victim to any potential budget cuts, which have impacted a significant number of other major Russian defense programs in recent years. If nothing else, the Russians are clearly interested in keeping the weapon, and the threat it presents to targets, even those shielded by extensive air and missile defenses, front and center in the minds of potential adversaries.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Norweigan authorities have released dramatic footage showing the exact moment of impact when the Royal Norwegian Navy’s Fridtjof Nanse n class frigate Helge Ingstad collided with the Malta-flagged oil tanker Sola in an accident that occurred exactly one year ago . The video clip comes along with the first part of a full report into the mishap, which totaled the Helge Ingstad , and that Norway says was the result of both immediate operational and technical factors and larger organizational and systemic issues among all the parties involved. The video presentation below, which the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) produced in cooperation with the Defense Accident Investigation Board Norway (DAIBN), as well as the Marine Safety Investigation Unit of Malta and the Spanish Standing Commission for Maritime Accident and Incident Investigations (CIAIM), is worth watching in full. The footage of the actual collision, which occurred near the Sture Oil and Gas Terminal outside of the city of Bergen, begins at around 6:30 in the runtime. The video, shot from onboard the Sola , shows sparks flying on the tanker’s deck as the two ships impact and scrape against each other. Seven of the Helge Ingstad ‘s crew of 137 suffered minor injuries in the mishap. None of the 24 mariners on the tanker were hurt and that ship suffered only minor damage. The Norwegian frigate, however, experienced substantial damage along its starboard side, which subsequently led to serious flooding and the ship effectively sinking. Norway subsequently launched a major salvage operation. Workers successfully refloated the ship in April 2019 and brought it to the Haakonsvern Naval Base for further inspection. Two months later, the Norwegian government officially announced that it would not repair the ship due to time and cost reasons. Official estimates said that it could cost anywhere between $1.3 and $1.5 billion to repair the ship and that they could take up to five years, given the extent of the damage. By contrast, it would take about as long to buy a new-build ship with at least similar capabilities, but only cost $1.1 to $1.2 billion. #Norway confirms decision not to repair KM Helge Ingstad https://t.co/B81Y4D0iwI pic.twitter.com/BWODYBxjPK — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) June 24, 2019 The Norweigan accident report also highlighted a number of significant factors that played a part in the accident and found fault among all parties involved, in addition to finally giving a firm timeline of the events. “Organisation, leadership, and teamwork on the [ Helge Ingstad ‘s] bridge were not expedient during the period leading up to the collision,” an executive summary explained. “In combination with the officer of the watch’s limited experience, the training being conducted for two watchstanding functions on the bridge reduced the bridge team’s capacity to address the overall traffic situation. Based on a firmly lodged situational awareness that the ‘object’ was stationary and that the passage was under control, little use was made of the radar and AIS to monitor the fairway.” The Helge Ingstad almost entirely underwater after the mishap., Forsvaret It’s interesting to note that Issues of experience and training, as well as confirmation bias and poor decision making, were also notably factors in a pair of deadly collisions between U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers and commercial ships in the Pacific Region in 2017. You can read more about those mishaps in this past War Zone piece . At the same time, “when Sola TS set out on its northbound passage with the forward-pointing deck lights turned on, it was difficult for the frigate’s bridge team to see the tanker’s navigation lights and the flashing of the Aldis lamp, and thereby identify the ‘object’ as a vessel,” the report added. “Furthermore, radar plotting and communication on the bridge did not sufficiently ensure the effect of active teamwork to build a common situational awareness. This could have increased the time window for identification and warning of the frigate.” “Lack of monitoring meant that the VTS operator’s situational awareness and overview of the VTS [Maritime Traffic Center] area were inadequate,” the summary of the review continued. “Hence, Fedje VTS did not provide the vessels involved with relevant and timely information and did not organize the traffic to ensure the tanker’s safe departure from the Sture Terminal.” Lastly, “ Helge Ingstad sailed with AIS in passive mode,” the report noted, referring to the ship’s Automatic Identification System transponder. “This meant that the frigate could not be immediately identified on the screens at Fedje VTS or Sola TS . None of the parties involved made sufficient use of available technical aids.” The Helge Ingstad fully out of the water after being refloated and brought in for inspection, showing the extent of the damage., Forsvaret The Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) has issued 15 safety recommendations as a result of its investigation already, including calls for better training practices within the Norwegian Navy, that the service’s ships should more regularly use their AIS transponders in the active mode while they are sailing in VTS-controlled areas, and that all of the Navy’s vessels should get voyage data recorders to help with investigating future mishaps. You can find all of the recommendations, as well as the full report here . The report does not elaborate on earlier comments from the Norwegian government that the design of the frigate itself may have contributed to the extent of the damage, something that the shipbuilder Navantia has publicly denied could have been the case. The report says that this and other additional investigations are ongoing, but that “this work presumes continued good collaboration with the responsible organizations, primarily the frigate manufacturer Navantia, the Navy and the Norwegian Defense Materiel Agency, and that the AIBN is being given unhampered access to relevant information.” The video of the collision itself gives added emphasis to how serious the mishap was and shows just how close the two ships came to potentially an even more serious accident.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 8, 2019",We Have The First Official Report On Norway’s Sunken Frigate And It Isn’t Pretty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Norwegian authorities have released a preliminary report regarding the collision of Royal Norwegian Navy frigate Helge Ingstad and the Malta-flagged oil tanker Sola on Nov. 8, 2018. The initial findings detail a series of confused missteps on the part of warship’s crew leading up to the accident, but also describe potentially serious defects in the ship’s basic design, which could have far-reaching ramifications. The Accident Investigation Board of Norway (AIBN), together with the Defense Accident Investigation Board Norway (DAIBN), publicly posted the first major review of the mishap online on Nov. 29, 2018. Helge Ingstad has been slowly sinking in the water outside of the Sture Oil and Gas Terminal outside of the city of Bergen since the accident occured, but the Norwegian Armed Forces, or Forsvaret , are continuing their efforts to salvage the vessel. The Sola only suffered minor damage. “This report is a preliminary presentation of the AIBN’s investigations relating to the accident and does not provide a full picture,” the report warns up front. “The report may contain errors and inaccuracies.” Based on what the investigators have determined so far, Helge Ingstad entered the fjord heading south and checked in with the Fedje Maritime Traffic Center , or Fedje VTS, at around 2:40 AM local time. Any ship over 80 feet long has to alert this control center before entering due to the narrow nature of the waterway. Helge Ingstad sails in front of the Canadian Halifax -class frigate Ville de Québec off the coast of Norway during NATO’s Exercise Trident Juncture in October 2018., USN The ship was traveling at approximately 20 miles per hour and had its navigation lights on. The ship’s Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder was set to “receive only” mode, meaning that it was not transmitting its own position and other information to ships in the area. At 3:40 AM, personnel on Helge Ingstad ’s bridge began to turn control of the ship over the next watch. At that time, the ship’s crew was aware of three northbound ships on its radar screen and had also visually observed “an object with many lights was observed lying still just outside the Sture terminal,” according to the report. Sola did not leave the terminal until 3:45 AM. Less than 15 minutes later, the tanker’s crew radioed the Fedje VTS to inquire about a contract on their radar that was sailing with its AIS transponder apparently off. At 4:00 AM, Fedje VTS identified the ship in question as probably Helge Ingstad and the tanker and the frigate began communicating directly. Approximately one minute later, the two ships collided. A gash in the side of Helge Ingstad after the collision., Forsvaret At present, investigators say the most likely cause of the accident was the frigate’s crew mistaking the lights they saw in the distance for a static object rather than a moving ship. The watchstanders on Helge Ingstad also appeared to believe, at least at the beginning, that they were communicating with one of the three other vessels they had previously identified on their radar. This determination is based in no small part on the response from Helge Ingstad to Sola ’s demand at that the warship immediately turn hard to starboard to avoid a collision. The frigate’s crew indicated that they couldn’t turn in that direction because they would hit the “lighted object” along the shore, which turned out to be the tanker in motion well away from the actual shoreline. The warship’s crew had told their counterparts onboard Sola that they planned to pass this object before turning, which could explain why they made no attempt to maneuver until right before the collision. This doesn’t explain why Helge Ingstad was unaware that there was a fourth ship heading north in the fjord, since Sola ’s AIS transponder was on and transmitting. Publicly available radar tracks, seen below, show the tanker, as well, meaning it should also have been visible to the frigate’s own radars, too. There also appears to have been a lapse in good judgment in crew’s decision to change the watch on the bridge while they were in the middle of a congested shipping lane. The preliminary report also raises questions regarding training and procedures for positively identifying ships and other potential hazards, especially in the dark. A final report on the incident should contain more thorough explanations of exactly how the final moments of the collision played out and recommendations for the Norwegian Navy to try and prevent these sorts of accidents in the future. “So far, the AIBN has not seen any indication of technical systems not working as intended up until the time of the collision,” the report notes. Separate from its findings regarding the events leading to the collision, the AIBN has also uncovered a serious technical issue that could have impacts well beyond this particular accident. Norwegian officials have alerted both the country’s navy and Spanish shipbuilder Navantia , which built the Helge Ingstad and Norway’s four other Fridtjof Nansen -class frigates , with concerns they have about the basic “watertight integrity” of the ships. “The AIBN has found safety critical issues relating to the vessel’s watertight compartments,” an annex to the main report explains. “This must be assumed to also apply to the other four Nansen-class frigates. It cannot be excluded that the same applies to vessels of a similar design delivered by Navantia, or that the design concept continues to be used for similar vessel models.” After the collision, the frigate’s crew identified flooding in three compartments, the aft generator room, a crew quarters, and the stores room. Damage parties were uncertain about whether or not the steering engine room, the ship’s aftmost compartment, was also filling with water. All of these compartments are all supposed to be watertight, specifically to help contain damage from spreading. Unfortunately, the frigate’s crew found that water was rushing from the generator room into the gear room, which was not otherwise breached, through the hollow propeller shaft tubes. Stuffing boxes in bulkheads in the gear room also failed, leading to flooding in the adjacent aft and fore engine rooms. “This meant that the flooding became substantially more extensive than indicated by the original damage,” the report explains. “Based on the flooding of the gear room, it was decided to prepare for evacuation.” Needless to say, this is a major problem. It calls into question the ability of the ships to withstand any serious damage to their aft compartments, something that is pretty important for a surface combatant. The five Fridtjof Nansen -class ships form the very core of Norway’s naval surface warfare capabilities, too. The loss of Helge Ingstad by itself has forced the Royal Norwegian Navy to reassess its deployment schedule and has prevented it from fulfilling the full scheduled extent of its obligations to Standing NATO Maritime Group One ( SNMG1 ). The Forsvaret continues to hope the frigate will only be temporarily out of commission, though this seems increasingly unlikely given the news about the extent of the damage and flooding. The first-in-class Fridtjof Nansen alongside the Helge Ingstad in Oslo in 2010., Bjoertvedt via Wikimedia Even more worryingly, the frigates are derived from Navantia’s F100 design , of which Spain has five in service, known as the Álvaro de Bazán -class . Navantia is also building a class of enlarged F100-derived destroyers, known as the Hobart -class , for Australia. Beyond that, the Spanish firm had unsuccessfully pitched a derivative of the design to Canada . It is still proposing one, through a partnership with U.S. contractor General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, to the U.S. Navy for that service’s FFG(X) program . If the watertight integrity issues are present in any of these other ships, it could have serious immediate impacts on the ability of the Norwegian and Spanish navies abilities to conduct operations. If the issues are widespread, and depending on how difficult and labor intensive they might be to fix, it could also delay work on Australia’s future Hobart -class ships. An artists conception of General Dynamics Bath Iron Works’ F100-derived proposal for the US Navy’s FFG(X) program., Bath Iron Works Even if Navantia worked out a relatively easy solution, that this problem escaped notice for so long – the first Fridtjof Nansen -class frigate entered service in 2006 – could make potential customers reticent to consider F100-derived ships or other designs from the company in the future. All told, the issue potentially opens up the shipbuilder, which is a Spanish-government owned enterprise, to lawsuits and financial losses. “Navantia has offered, since the very beginning, its collaboration with the [Royal Norwegian Navy] in order to clarify the accident,” Esther Benito Lope, a Navantia spokesperson, told Defense News . “Navantia will analyze all the possibilities, considering that some of the mentioned possibilities … are concluded from a very preliminary investigation.” The full extent of the damage and the exact nature of any design flaws won’t be known until Norway raises Helge Ingstad from the seabed and gets her back into port. This salvage process is still underway, but has been significantly delayed since the frigate almost completely sank on the night of Nov. 12-13, 2018. Bad weather has further hampered the recovery effort. On Nov. 29, 2018, the Forsvaret said that contractors had attached additional chains to help keep the ship in place and prevent it from completely sinking beneath the waves. Ships and other equipment from private maritime company BOA , which is leading the salvage operation, including the floating crane barge Rambiz and diver support ship Risøy , are in the area and waiting for the weather to clear to resume work. The crane barge Rambiz at work at the site of the mostly sunken Helge Ingstad ., Forsvaret With all the factors at play, there is no firm timeline for when the Norwegian Navy might get Helge Ingstad into a dry dock so inspectors can get a full look at the ship, inside and out. If nothing else, Norway is down at least one frigate and it’s already looking to reassess whether the four it has left are truly combat ready.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 4, 2020",Russian Drone “Strike Groups” Jammed And Bombed Air Defenses During Huge Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian military reportedly integrated unmanned “strike groups” consisting of armed Orlan-10 unmanned aircraft, as well as other variants of that drone with sensor and electronic warfare payloads , to locate and try to destroy critical air defense systems, command posts, communications nodes, and more during a major exercise earlier this year. This news comes a month after researchers at Russia’s Zhukovsky Air Force Academy announced it was working to develop a drone swarm to attack enemy convoys, among other potential target sets. On Nov. 7, 2019, Russian newspaper Izvestia , citing anonymous officials within Russia’s Ministry of Defense, first reported the use of the drone strike groups during an exercise in September 2019 called Tsentr-2019, or Center-2019. This was the culmination of a series of exercises that had begun in June. The Kremlin holds these drills each year to demonstrate its ability to prosecute a potential large scale conflict in the center of the country. The 2019 iteration was especially large , with around 128,000 personnel from Russia, as well as China, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The Russian military’s reportedly employment of armed Orlan-10s is notable by itself. In July 2019, Izvestia had reported that Russia was looking to field small armed drones, but that these would likely be quadcopter type designs carrying very small grenade-like payloads. A member of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet prepares an Orlan-10 drone for a mission in March 2019., Alexey Malgavko / Sputnik  via AP The Orlan-10 only has a maximum takeoff weight of around 33 pounds, which would suggest that whatever weapons it might be able to carry are quite small. It certainly calls into question Izvestia ‘s description of their new arsenal as including “special guided missiles.” It’s also possible that there was some confusion in the information from its sources and that the armed component of the drone strike groups was actually another type of unmanned aircraft, such as the Carnivore , which Russian firm NPP Mikran unveiled in 2018. This unmanned aircraft is larger than Orlan-10, with a maximum weight of around 88 pounds, and a promotion video showed one potential variant carrying a payload of six standard Russian RGD-5 hand grenades , as well as small sensor turret. The other components of the strike group were Orlan-10s carrying sensor turrets with electro-optical and infrared cameras or the Leer-3 electronic warfare systems. Both of these are known variants that have been in service for some time now. The concept of operations demonstrated during Tsentr-2019 involved the sensor and electronic warfare-equipped Orlan-10s locating and classifying targets of interest. The armed drones would then move in to conduct mock attacks. Depending on the size of the weapons these Russians actually expect these unmanned aircraft to employ in real combat, the goal may be more to achieve mission kills on target systems through the destruction of radars, antennas, or other smaller, but nevertheless vital components. This sounds very much like the next logical evolution of tactics the Russians have already honed in Ukraine, where Orlan-10s with sensor and electronic warfare payloads have been conducting similar operations to locate targets, as well as jam them, for years now. However, in that conflict, at least so far, mortars and other artillery weapons have been the primary assets called upon to actually destroy the targets that the drones find. The Russian drone strike groups operating during Tsentr-2019 also worked to wreak havoc on enemy rear areas, including targeting convoys of reinforcements, according to Izvestia . The story noted that even small munitions could cause substantial damage to fuel and ammunition depots. Though not mentioned in the Russian newspaper story, in 2017, Ukranian officials initially suggested that a massive explosion at the country’s largest ammunition depot in Balakliya was the result of a small drone dropping an incendiary device onto the facility. Ukranian officials subsequently revised their position , saying they still suspected sabotage, but that there was no evidence that a drone delivered the weapon that set off the blast. It is very likely that Russia is exploring tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing armed drones, in general, as it gets closer to fielding larger, longer endurance types, such as Predator-sized Orion-E. On Nov. 1, 2019, state-run media outlet TASS , citing an anonymous source within Russia’s defense industry, reported that Orion-Es had carried out strikes using unspecified munitions in Syria as part of a field test earlier in the year. The Russians are also developing an armed version of the Forpost drone, itself a license-produced version of the Israeli Searcher II . The Kremlin is proceeding with the development of the Altius-U , which flew for the first time in August 2019 and is also expected to be able to carry weapons, as well. These efforts are in addition to the much more advanced S-70 Okhotnik-B unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) program. In October 2019, researchers with the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy had separately announced that they were working on a drone swarm concept, known as Flock-93, which could involve up to 100 small vertical take off and landing capable unmanned aircraft, each with an explosive payload weighing around five and a half pounds. It is unclear what specific type of drones Zhukovsky plans to use as part of Flock-93, but the goal is for the swarm to have a range of just around 95 miles. The researchers from Zhukovsky also did not say if they will be designed to drop a weapon on their targets or operate as suicide drones , though the latter seems much more likely. They did note that their plan was to develop a true autonomous swarm, where if one drone were to get shot down, another would immediately take over the tasks its fallen comrade had been performing, according to C4ISRNet . Networked swarms, especially those utilizing drones with various different capabilities, offer a host of other benefits, which you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone piece . Group Kronstadt, the firm behind Orion, and Autonomous Aerospace Systems-GeoService are also involved in Flock-93. Zhukovsky itself is notably responsible for developing multiple iterations of an owl-shaped reconnaissance drone . https://youtube.com/watch?v=idprk-J_YiQ The main target for Flock-93 is reportedly enemy convoys consisting of lightly armored or unarmored vehicles, including supply vehicles in rear areas, similar to the missions that the drone strike groups reportedly conducted during Tsentr-2019. Drone swarms, by their nature , are ideal for confusing and overwhelming hostile air defenses, as well. “Russia has not demonstrated a UAV swarm in action yet,” Samuel Bendett, a researcher with the Center for Naval Analyses think tank, told C4ISRNet . “So the statement that Flock-93 will have dozens of UAVs is an interesting one – we have not seen Russia working with such a large number of unmanned aerial systems, at least not publicly.” However, what is clear is that the Russians are very invested in expanding the size of their drone fleets and the scope of operations they are capable of undertaking. The evolution of Russia’s use of the Orlan-10 in Ukraine, as well as Syria, by itself, was a good indicator of this even before Izvestia new report on how the drones performed during Tsentr-2019. Beyond that, the Kremlin has experienced for itself just how destructive and otherwise frustrating even relatively low-tech mass drone attacks can be during its campaign in Syria and has otherwise been watching unmanned developments unfold around the world. In addition, small cheap swarming drones would be a low-cost, but high-reward capability for Russia, even just as a deterrent against potential adversaries . Homemade drones, including one carrying improvised munitions, that the Russians said they recovered following a mass drone attack on their personnel at Khmeimim air base in Syria in 2018., Russian Ministry of Defense This reality is only becoming more apparent, in general, in hotspots around the world. Other large nation states, such as China, are making similar investments in increasingly advanced unmanned aircraft and drone swarm technologies , but smaller countries and non-state actors are increasingly gaining access to more limited, but still very valuable drone capabilities, too. Unprecedented suicide drone and cruise missile attacks on oil-related sites in Saudi Arabia in September 2019 underscored just how much damage it is possible to do with relatively simply technology and limited resources. There is evidence that Iran at least actively supported these attacks, if it did not carry them out directly. The over-arching significance of this incident was something the War Zone highlighted at the time and has been sounding the alarm about for years . For Russia, the use of drone strike groups involving multiple unmanned aircraft with diverse capabilities operating together during Tsentr-2019 is certainly new, but, by every indication, it is also something that looks set to become a very common component of how that country wages war in the future.

At any given time, thousands of U.S. Navy sailors are plowing the seas all around the world, and sometimes in some very rough neighborhoods in which relative peace and turn into outright hostility in a matter of seconds. We hear quite a bit from the officers aboard everything from supercarriers to nuclear submarines, but not enough from those who actually make the Navy’s goals even remotely achievable, the enlisted crew , some of who aren’t even old enough to legally consume alcohol. This stark reality is precisely why I really enjoyed this mini-documentary that gives sailors’ perspectives of life aboard the Navy’s most numerous surface combatant, the Arleigh Burke class destroyer, in this case, USS Paul Hamilton (DDG-60). There is a lot to take away from this video. I always find it fascinating how so many enlisted crewmen knew little about the Navy, its ships, and the various positions required to make them run, before joining the service. Under such circumstances, enlisting seems like a bewilderingly brave leap for an individual to make that seems almost alien to me. Considering how new to all of it so many of its freshly minted sailors are, it is amazing how well the Navy actually runs and how dedicated to the job these sailors quickly become. Also, even on a destroyer with a crew of a few hundred people or so, the social structures that manifest themselves among a bedrock of camaraderie at the unit department level is fascinating. Without it, I don’t think any of this would be possible. As we approach Veteran’s Day, the bottom line to comprehend is that the U.S. military largely runs on youth. These are kids out there doing the hardest jobs long day in and long day out, without complaints, so that the rest of us back home can sleep soundly at night. It really is a remarkable thing.

On Nov. 6, 2019, Ivan Androsov, CEO of the Moscow Design and Production Center Universal, a division of the Russian state-owned Technodinamika holding company, announced that his firm would conduct the dynamic drop testing of the 2S42, according to state media outlet TASS . The Central Scientific Research Institute for Precision Machine Engineering, also known by its Russian acronym TsNIITochMash, is leading the development of the Lotos. Both Technodinamika and TsNIITochMash are themselves subsidiaries of Russia’s main state-run industrial conglomerate, Rostec. “Universal is currently taking part in this R&D work,” Androsov explained to TASS . “We have made a set of the landing system for this gun to confirm the possibility of air-dropping this weapon and are planning to hold dynamic drop tests before the end of the year.” A 2S42 Lotos prototype., RIA Novosti The 2S42 is mounted on a lengthened derivative of the chassis from the existing BMD-4M air-droppable infantry fighting vehicle, which is also used for the 2S25 Sprut-SD assault gun. The BMD-4M chassis only has five roadwheels on each side, while the Lotos and Sprut-SD have seven. A Russian BMD-4M airborne infantry fighting vehicle., Vitaly Kuzmin All of these vehicles have an adjustable suspension system that makes them more compact for airdrops and can help with getting over obstacles once they are on the ground. The drop testing will be critical for determining if the vehicle and its suspension can handle the shock of landing after getting parachuted out of a cargo aircraft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=tmXKHBz8QQI TsNIITochMash says that the Lotos, which it formally unveiled to the public at the Army 2019 exhibition at the Patriot Park military theme park in Kubinka outside of Moscow in June 2019, weighs approximately 18 tons , nearly four and a half tons heavier than the BMD-4M. The 2S42’s 450 horsepower diesel engine can reportedly propel the vehicle up to a maximum speed of nearly 43 and a half miles per hour on improved roads. The Lotos also has a much larger turret than the BMD-4M. The 2S42’s main weapon is the contains the 120mm 2A80-1 gun-mortar. This weapon has reportedly been in Russian service with regular ground forces since at least 2011 on the 2S34 Hosta , which shares the same chassis as the 2S1 Gvozdika 122mm self-propelled howitzer. The Lotos also has a machine-gun armed remotely operated weapon station so the crew can engage secondary targets from within the safety of the armored hull, as well as smoke grenade launchers to help conceal the vehicle if necessary. A pair of 2S34 Hostas, which use the same 120mm gun-mortar as the 2S42 Lotos., Vitaly Kuzmin Gun-mortars are, as the name suggests, hybrid weapons that straddle the definitions of conventional main guns on armored vehicles and traditional mortars. Most commonly found on vehicles, they offer an artillery piece that is far lighter than traditional howitzers, but with better range than similarly sized standard infantry mortars. They also provide better direct-fire capabilities than typical mortars, which are generally restricted to high-angle indirect fire, too. As such, Russia has developed a wide array of ammunition for the 2A80-1 to suit both indirect and direct fire applications and the gun-mortar can reportedly fire the laser-guided Kitolov-2M round. The Lotos’ main role is still indirect fire missions, though, with the Sprut-SD, which packs a 125mm main gun similar to the ones found on Russian main battle tanks, providing a more robust ability to take on heavier armored vehicles and fixed targets. A 2S25 Sprut-SD airborne assault gun., Vitaly Kuzmin For airborne forces who rely heavily on the vehicles and other equipment that they can bring with them in the initial stages of an assault, a design such as the 2S42 still provides valuable and flexible added firepower, both as an artillery piece and a lighter assault gun. The Russian Army, and the Soviets before them, had recognized this and had introduced the 120mm 2S9 Nona self-propelled gun-mortar back in 1981. This design utilized a modified version of the chassis from the BTR-D armored personnel carrier, which was itself based on the earlier BMD-1 airborne infantry fighting vehicle. Russia has been trying to replace the 2S9 since at least 2015. That year the country revealed it was working on the 2S36 Zauralets. Previously reports conflict about the exact configuration and capabilities of this vehicle, with Russian officials saying that it would be available armed with both 120mm and 152mm weapons. The 2S36 was also reportedly going to be based on the BMD-4M. The Kremlin suspended work on Zauralets in 2016 and subsequently shifted its focus to the 2S42. There is no mention at this time of a 152mm version, which could require the development of a new, larger gun-mortar or some sort of lightweight, low-recoil howitzer . A model of the Lotos emerged the following year. Leveraging the existing chassis and main weapon certainly give the Lotos the appearance of a lower-risk, and potentially lower cost, project. The hope now is for the vehicle to complete all the necessary tests by the end of this year so it can begin entering service sometime in 2020. The 2S42 model that TsNIITochMash first displayed in 2017., Vitaly Kuzmin The 2S42 is part of a broader modernization effort aimed at expanding the capabilities of air-droppable armored vehicles available to Russian airborne units. This also includes the development of the Sprut-SDM1 variant, which will reportedly carry the improved 2A46 125mm main gun, the same one found on early models of the T-90 main battle tank, as well as other upgraded full-size Russian tanks, such as the T-72B3 and T-80BVM . This mirrors similar developments within the U.S. Army, which is also looking to a new light tank to equip its airborne units and a turreted gun-mortar system to go on a future variant of its Stryker 8×8 wheeled vehicle family. Last year, the 82nd Airborne Division began receiving a small number of second-hand 8×8 LAV-25A2 light wheeled armored vehicles from the U.S. Marine Corps to provide an interim air-droppable armored vehicle capability. With any luck, Russian airborne units may be getting close to finally receiving a replacement for their Cold War-era 2S9s in the new year.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon recently released a video showing U.S. Air Force special operations CV-22 Ospreys equipped with a new cabin floor and ramp system rapidly inserting and extracting personnel on snowmobiles during an exercise in Norway in a scene straight out of an old G.I. Joe comic. However, this tactic could be of very real importance in the future as the U.S. military and its allies increasingly prepare for the potential for a large scale conflict to occur in and around the strategic Arctic region . https://youtube.com/watch?v=8N7vzg1dVYo The U.S. Department of Defense’s official Twitter account included the footage in a post on Nov. 5, 2019, but did not say when the exercise occurred or what American units were involved specifically. At least one other copy appeared on YouTube the day before. There Air Force’s 7th Special Operations Squadron , part of the 352nd Special Operations Wing , is equipped with CV-22s and is forward-deployed at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom, but units from the United States also regularly travel to various locations in Europe to conduct training exercises. The clip shows Norweigan military personnel actually operating the snowmobiles, as well as exiting the Ospreys on skis. American special operations forces , as well as conventional units across the U.S. military , regularly train to insert and extract personnel riding on various types of motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles , other light vehicles , and even boats , using Ospreys and heavy helicopters, as well as larger aircraft . These tactics allow personnel to rapidly move away from a landing zone, making it more difficult for opponents to respond to the insertion, and quickly get back onto aircraft at the end of a mission, limiting the amount of time the entire force is vulnerable on the ground. The Air Force has now developed a dedicated system for supporting snowmobile operations in conjunction with the CV-22, which keeps the cabin floor protected from potential damage and allows operators driving the vehicles to get safely in and out of the tilt-rotor. The exercise in Norway appears to be one of the first opportunities to test an improved version of this configuration in a real-world environment. CV-22s assigned to the 7th Special Operations Squadron covered in snow at RAF Mildenhall., USAF “The V-22s had already worked a little bit with snowmobile insertion and extraction, bringing them to where we need them and then picking them back up,” an unnamed Air Force special operator says in the video the Pentagon released. “We knew that the users were wanting more Arctic operations. We knew that snowmobiles were becoming a little bit of a high-interest item.” That same individual said that originally Osprey crews working with snowmobiles had installed rubber horse stall mats in the main cabin of the aircraft and attached them to the floor with carabiner clips in a “makeshift” arrangement. Personnel also added extensions to the CV-22’s rear ramp, created by cutting up an old tread from a snowmobile into multiple sections, for the vehicles to drive up inside the aircraft. “The issues that we found with that was that the conditions had to be exactly right in order for the snowmobile to actually get on the ramp,” the air Force special operator noted. “The way we had to use the existing ramp system just hindered us in too many ways.” The video shows that there is now an improved set of cabin mats that screw securely to the floor inside the Osprey and a purpose-built three-piece rubber ramp extension. This is known as the Snowmobile Loading and Transportation System (SLATS). The CV-22’s rear-mounted .50 caliber GAU-21/A machine gun is already on a mount that swings out of the way so personnel and vehicles to rapidly exit and enter the aircraft. It works the exact same way in conjunction with the snowmobile system. A screen capture from the Pentagon’s video showing an Air Force special operator installing the new screw-in rubber mats for snowmobile operations inside a CV-22 Osprey., DOD capture Another screen capture highlighting the three-piece rubber ramp extension., DOD capture That this capability was on display during an exercise in Norway is hardly surprising. The NATO member began hosting regular rotations of U.S. Marines in 2017 as part of broader changes in the alliance’s posture in Scandanavia, which are aimed at a countering potential Russian aggression in that region. Last year, the Norweigan government agreed to allow even larger contingents of Marines to deploy for longer periods as part of this rotating mission. In 2018, Norway also hosted Trident Juncture, the largest NATO exercise in decades , which involved forces from alliance members, and other regional partners, on land, in the air, and at sea. More than 50,000 personnel in total, along with hundreds of aircraft and dozens of ships, took part. U.S. special operations and conventional forces from across the services have been taking part in a growing number of smaller exercises and other more routine training events in the region in recent years, as well. Over the last few years, Russian combat aircraft have conducted a number of exercises that have included mock attack runs on a strategic radar site in Norway’s far north, a facility that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , as well. There have also been unconfirmed reports this year that Russia has actually infiltrated special operations units onto Norweigan soil above the Arctic Circle. The Arctic, overall, is only becoming of greater significance to various countries, including the United States and Russia. The Russian military has been building and expanding a number of air bases and other facilities in its far north regions, which are increasingly able to support heavy aviation operations and more. Russia has also begun to develop a number of ground vehicles , including its own combat snowmobiles , with fully-enclosed cabs to allow for greater comfort in extremely low temperatures, specifically for operations in this region. During a potential major conflict in the region, special operators, as well as conventional forces, could easily find themselves needing to rapidly get in and out of remote areas to conduct various missions, including long-range intelligence-gathering patrols and direct action raids. Ospreys, as well as other aircraft and helicopters, inserting small units on snowmobiles could be an important component of these types of operations. Ospreys have the added advantage of being able to fly further and faster than traditional helicopters, which could be critical for accessing remote Arctic areas. They can also do so while flying at very low levels, under any weather conditions, and at night, which normal helicopters can’t. These capabilities could also make CV-22s carrying forces on snowmobiles a valuable asset for responding to reports of hostile infiltrators, as well. Members of the US Army’s 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) train to use snowmobiles in Colorado in February 2019. The bulk of this unit is based at Fort Carson, Colorado, but its 1st Battalion in forward-deployed in Germany., US Army All told, as the Air Force special operator narrating the video said, snowmobiles are becoming a more integral part of U.S. operations in places like Norway. So, while it might seem like something out of an action movie, the U.S. military’s real interest in being able to deploy forces with these vehicles rapidly, using aircraft such as the CV-22, will only continue to grow in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 26, 2019",Airbus’s Secret Stealth Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Research Program Breaks Cover (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Airbus has just released images and information about its previously undisclosed Low Observable UAV Testbed (LOUT) program that worked to provide the company with a better understanding of cutting-edge very low-observable (stealthy) design, material and manufacturing sciences, and other associated technologies. The program dates back well over a decade, but is just breaking cover now and it stands to portray the European planemaker in a different light when it comes to its ability to produce next-generation combat aircraft. LOUT was based on a Skunk Works concept of program execution, which you can read all about in detail in this past post of ours . The initiative incorporated holistic signature reduction techniques across RF, IR, visual, and acoustic domains. It also worked to better understand how to integrate advanced electronic warfare and countermeasures into a stealthy design to increase its survivability. Advanced mission control and sensor fusion software that compared the aircraft’s signature against threat capabilities in its environment was also part of the initiative as was the integration of advanced sensors beneath its stealthy skin. All areas of stealth technology, from the aircraft’s air inlets , to its exhaust , to its sensor apertures, and other radar defeating sub-structures were incorporated into the design. Stealthy low-probability of intercept (LPI) communications and sensors and even cybersecurity were also parts of the program. So, we are basically talking about a huge risk reduction and research program that could work as a pre-runner to eventually designing and producing a stealthy operational airframe. From what we know about the program at this point in time, no flying airframe was ever built or tested. This risk reduction and knowledgebase expansion effort has some parallels to BAE’s “Replica” demonstrator , which was part of the Royal Air Force’s Future Offensive Air System (FOAS) initiative in the 1990s. That program also resulted in a high-end mockup that worked to build knowledge about next-generation low-observable technologies. Check out images below of LOUT in the anechoic chamber . Note that the canopy is not representative of a manned design, but the modular platform was used to investigate all types of low-observable apertures, including translucent canopies for manned low-observable aircraft. And yes, it looks a lot like Bird of Prey’s canopy ! Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus A series of slides that were distributed regarding the program’s timeline and objectives. Note that it looks like two large prototypes were built. The one shown looks similar in planform to the X-47A Pegasus , while the other looks more like a traditional stealthy flying-wing unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) design. Here is the slide presentation in full: Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus While the whole LOUT exercise appears to have been an endeavor to develop competitive intellectual property that will help keep the company in the air combat aircraft space for years to come, looking at these pictures, I feel like this is the aircraft America should have had in the air long ago—or maybe it actually did. For years, I have written about the ‘missing link ‘ between the RQ-170 Sentinel and its RQ-3 Darkstar progenitor and the grandfather of penetrating, persistent reconnaissance, Northrop’s Tacit Blue demonstrator . A still-secret manned aircraft that theoretically could have looked very similar to this, often referred to informally as the TR-3A Black Manta, which would have been able to penetrate and persist within enemy air defense networks to gather intelligence, may have been that missing link. Regardless of historical speculation, a subsonic, very low observable tactical platform, similar to the one shown above, would be very useful in an age in which advanced integrated air defense systems (IADS) will increasingly challenge even the United States’ best stealth fighters like the F-22 and F-35—aircraft that were optimized to evade a narrow group of radar bands typically associated with fire control radars. Beyond that, the burning question of where are America’s mysteriously missing unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) is maybe the biggest pet topic of this site—one that we have delved into deeper than anyone else and it is a question for which the answer remains a mystery. You can read all about this strange and potentially damning situation in this special feature of ours. This remains the case even as America’s potential foes and friends alike are rapidly and overtly developing their own UCAV capabilities . Setting aside the hype surrounding sixth-generation fighters , swarms of advanced and autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles, along with less capable unmanned systems and swarming munitions , are the future of air combat. With all this in mind, in a way, maybe the photos above of LOUT also inadvertently and tangentially represent parts of America’s own hidden aerospace history staring back at us. Regardless, what we know for is that the European aerospace giant hasn’t rested when it comes to understanding next-generation stealth technology and how to integrate it into an airframe and that fact makes its Future Combat Air System (FCAS) initiative a bit more plausible and well assured than it seemed yesterday. UPDATE: 7:30am PST— We now have additional details on the LOUT, including that the pictures Airbus provided are of a four-ton model with a wingspan of just over 39 feet that Airbus used for aerodynamic and anechoic chamber testing, according to FlightGlobal . Aviation Week has also reported that this test article is a subscale representation of a 20-ton design. FlightGlobal says that Airbus revealed that the LOUT’s twin intakes are blended into the upper fuselage and feed air to the engines via “diverterless inlets,” a technology that Lockheed Martin pioneered in the 1990s. You can read more about why these features are important in this past War Zone piece . There has also been work on incorporating radar-absorbing structures into the intake ducts themselves. The design has an exhaust that is shielded from below, specifically to help protect the aircraft against ground-based air defenses, as well. Mario Hertzog, the program manager at Airbus for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) effort who had been on hand to talk reporters through the LOUT project, did not say whether or not the German government was interested in a full UCAV development program based on this demonstrator. He did say that the lessons learned from the program would inform the still evolving FCAS effort, which is working to develop a family of air combat systems including a manned fifth-generation fighter jet and various types of unmanned aircraft, including “ loyal wingmen ” drones. Germany, France , and Spain , are working together on FCAS. Hertzog added that the LOUT effort could lead to future upgrades for the Eurofighter Typhoon , which a European consortium that includes Airbus produces, too. This might become an additional selling point for those advanced fourth-generation fighter jets. This comment may be aimed most immediately at Germany, which is considering Typhoon , as well as other aircraft, including the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , to replace its aging Panavia Tornado swing-wing combat jets.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2019",Saudi Troops Are Using This Huge Grenade Launcher Gun That Looks Like An Action Movie Prop,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures and a video have emerged online reportedly showing a Saudi Arabian soldier engaged in the conflict against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen using a Chinese-made Norinco LG5 man-portable 40mm grenade launcher. This appears to be the first evidence of the weapon, which looks like a prop gun from a Hollywood blockbuster, being in service outside China, as well as its first use in combat anywhere. Twitter user SulaimanAldoosari , who also goes by SAUDI_POWER0 on Instagram, posted the images of the LG5 in use with Saudi forces in Yemen on social media on Nov. 3, 2019. It is unclear how long the Saudis have been using the weapon, but Defence Blog reported in February 2018, citing unnamed sources, that Chinese state-run arms company Norinco had secured an order for the grenade launchers from an unspecified “Middle East customer.” The LG5 is the export version of the People’s Liberation Army’s QLU-11 , which Norinco first introduced in 2011. The primary difference between the two is that the PLA’s version fires the Chinese military’s standard 35x32mm grenade, while the model intended for foreign sales uses ubiquitous 40x53mm rounds, an ammunition type that the United States originally developed. Both launchers feed from drum magazines of various capacities. The 35mm variant has versions that can hold three, five, and seven rounds, while the 40mm version has five and 15-round types. The QLU-11/LG5 is a curious weapon often described as “sniper” grenade launcher and can be used in a shoulder-fired configuration with a bipod as a very large anti-materiel rifle. In this configuration, the QLU-11 version weighs just around 29 and a half pounds. For comparison, the iconic Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle weighs around 30 pounds, depending on the exact variant. The Chinese weapon uses a recoiling barrel and recoil-absorbing stock assembly, as seen in the video below, to help reduce the shock of firing and keep weight to a minimum. https://youtube.com/watch?v=tXB0XtMs18w There is limited information available in English about the LG5, but it is very possible that the 40mm LG5 weighs more given the added strain on the weapon, and the shooter, when firing the more powerful cartridge. The video of the Saudi soldier using the weapon in Yemen, which shows him exerting a not-insignificant amount of effort to get it into a firing position, makes it clear that it is anything but light regardless of its exact weight. It’s worth noting that the U.S. military does not have any shoulder-fired 40x53mm weapon in service, using that ammunition only in heavier automatic grenade launchers mounted on tripods or vehicles. Previous experiments by the U.S. military and Western defense contractors to develop individual weapons firing the 40x53mm cartridge, or medium-velocity derivatives, have not been successful. Still, there has been clear interest in the United States and elsewhere in larger, multi-shot grenade launchers. The U.S. Marine Corps and American special operators have adopted six-shot revolver-style grenade launchers, but which fire the low-velocity 40x46mm round. With all this in mind, it’s perhaps not surprising that the QLU-11/LG5 can also be used in a tripod-mounted configuration more akin to a traditional automatic grenade launcher. This would seem almost necessary when using the weapon in conjunction with one of the larger ammunition drums. A promotional picture of an LG5 on a tripod with a 15-round drum magazine, as well as a computerized optic., via Wikimedia The Chinese were reportedly inspired to develop the QLU-11/LG5, in part, by the U.S. Army’s work on the XM109 “ Anti-Materiel Payload Rifle ” in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The XM109 was a derivative of the .50 caliber Barrett that used 25mm ammunition that the service had developed for a series of abortive future weapons, including the XM29 Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW), XM307 Objective Crew-Served Weapon (OSCW), and the XM25 Individual Semi-Automatic Airburst System (ISAAS) or Counter-Defilade Target Engagement (CDTE) system. The Barrett XM109., US Army Norinco had also developed the QLZ-87 grenade launcher , which is very similar in general form and function to the QLU-11/LG5, in the late 1980s. This weapon also fired the 35x32mm round and soldiers could use it in shoulder-fired and tripod-mounted configurations. The QLZ-87 has already seen some export success of its, primarily to countries in Africa. A Ugandan soldier in Somalia with the African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, holds a QLZ-87 while manning a defensive position in 2012., AMISOM As with the older QLZ-87, in the bipod-equipped configuration, the new QLU-11/LG5 is useful as both an area fire weapon against groups of lightly armored and unarmored targets, as well as potentially a point-fire weapon against individual threats. The LG5 reportedly has a maximum effective range around area target of around 3,280 feet, but can saturate a larger area with less accurate fire up 7,220 feet away, depending on the type of ammunition used. There is a diverse array of ammunition available, including high-explosive dual-purpose rounds with anti-personnel and light armor-piercing effects, as well an air-burst type to engage enemy forces hiding behind hard cover such as rocks or inside structures. With this in mind, it seems well-suited to Saudi Arabia’s fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who primarily use modified civilian vehicles or operate on foot. Significant parts of the country are also mountainous, making the LG5’s range and ability to neutralize threats shielded by rocky outcroppings even more valuable. Houthi rebels ride in a Toyota pickup truck with a mounted DShK 12.7mm machine gun in the Yemeni capital Sana’a in December 2018., Hani Al-Ansi/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Though the Saudi version we have seen so far has a simple telescopic optic, China has offered the LG5 with a computerized optic that includes laser range finder. This would help improve the accuracy of the weapon, which could make it even more lethal. Regardless, the LG5 also offers a weapon that is more readily portable by small units in rugged terrain than heavier automatic grenade launchers, especially those mounted on vehicles that may have more difficulty operating in mountainous environments. At the same time, it also offers increased firepower and range, as well as a greater volume of fire, over single-shot grenade launchers , including stand-alone types or examples that troops can carry attached to standard infantry rifles and carbines. It will be interesting now to see if reports emerge about how effective the LG5 turns out to be in actual combat. At the same time, it’s worth noting that the conflict in Yemen has called into question the general quality and capability of Saudi forces, which The War Zone has previously explored in detail . If the Saudi experience with this action movie-esque “sniper” grenade launcher is at all positive, it may help China secure further export sales of the LG5 in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019",U.S. Special Ops Soldier Talks To Reporter In Syrian Oil Fields As Mission Remains In Flux,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. forces are now patrolling oil and gas-related sites in at least two distinct regions of Syria, including one that is situated close to where Russian personnel aligned with the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad are also operating as part of a deal between Russia and Turkey. American troops in that particular area are also working together with members of the U.S.-backed, predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces within a so-called “safe zone” along the Turkish border, despite a separate agreement between Washington and Ankara that those local forces would withdraw from such locations entirely. This all comes as U.S. forces elsewhere in northern Syria have again found themselves at risk of attack from Turkish-backed forces, though thankfully the artillery fire did not cause any American casualties. On Nov. 4, 2019, an unnamed U.S. special operator confirmed to local journalists that, at least for the time being, the United States expects to continue having a presence in and around the Rmelan oilfield in far northeastern Syria. Some of the first reports that American personnel riding in M-ATV mine-resistant vehicles had returned to this area appeared on Oct. 31, 2019, but it was unclear what their mission and final destination might have been at the time. That same day, U.S. Army Bradley Fighting Vehicles and additional American troops had made headlines when they arrived in Deir Ez Zor in eastern Syria to guard strategic oil and gas fields in that part of the country. U.S. forces have withdrawn from a number of major operating locations in northern Syria since Turkey launched a major intervention in the country, targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), on Oct. 9, 2019. A map showing the general locations of Rmelan, in the far northeast corner of the country, and where US forces are operating near Deir Ez Zor further to the south., Google Maps “We’re just finding out all this information right now and we’re going to continue our presence up here,” the unidentified U.S. special operator told Rudaw , a news network based in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, on Nov. 4. “We’re working with the SDF and they’re letting us know the situation up here as they see it.” What’s immediately curious about this deployment is that it would appear to be in violation of a deal that the United States and Turkey had agreed to on Oct. 17, 2019. That plan called for the withdrawal of all elements of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, also known as the YPG, which have formed the core of the SDF, from areas within 18 miles of the Turkish border. The city of Rmelan is just over 10 miles from the Turkish border and the surrounding oil fields are also within this “safe zone.” There is no specific clause in that agreement that demands the United States cease its activities in this area, but there is also no caveat allowing for the SDF to remain if they are working together with U.S. troops. The American special operator who spoke to Rudaw made it clear these local forces remain in the area and continue to work closely with U.S. forces, despite the Oct. 17 deal. In addition, U.S. forces patrolling in and around Rmelan are doing so very close to where Russian troops are now operating as part of a separate arrangement that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to on Oct. 22, 2019. That deal specifically laid out plans for Russia to patrol an area approximately 6 miles deep along much of the Syrian side of the border. A map the Russian Ministry of Defense released regarding the country’s agreement with Turkey on the division of responsibilities in Syria. The dashed line represents the approximately 6-mile deep zone that Russian troops will patrol along much of the Syrian-Turkish border, while the dashed and dotted line is the full extent of the “safe zone” where SDF forces are no longer supposed to be operating. The green triangles represent Russia’s plans to establish fixed observation posts. The shaded area in the center reflects a zone that Turkish forces will patrol themselves. The light yellow areas in northeastern Syria represent areas that had been under the control of the U.S.-led coalition and its SDF partners, which have contracted somewhat as a result of the Turkish intervention., Russian Ministry of Defense The U.S. force’s exact mission in Rmelan is not entirely clear, either, though it seems inline with recently publicly stated goals from President Donald Trump and the Pentagon to secure various oil and gas resources in order to prevent ISIS or other terrorist groups, as well as the Assad regime, from being able to exploit them. “We did leave soldiers [in Syria] because we’re keeping the oil. I like oil. We’re keeping the oil,” Trump told reporters on Nov. 1, 2019. https://youtube.com/watch?v=otP-AxlKKTE Experts and observers have raised serious questions about whether or not such an objective would be legal under U.S. or international laws. There have also been reports that the Pentagon specifically framed its desire to remain in Syria to hold ground against ISIS and Assad around natural resources to help sway the opinion of Trump, who has repeatedly expressed a desire to withdraw from the country entirely. There are indications that U.S. military officials are still trying to align their actual objectives with the President’s statements and that personnel on the ground in Syria have not received clear orders themselves about how to proceed. The obvious concern is that U.S. forces continuing to operate in Rmelan and other areas inside or near the designated “safe zone” face increased risks of deliberate and inadvertent altercations with a diverse array of potential opponents. Underscoring the complexity and fluidity of the situation, the Russian Ministry of Defense was actually first to reveal that elements of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA) launched an artillery attack on U.S. forces driving along the M4 highway near the town of Tel Tamir on Nov. 3, 2019. This is an area that is also within the agreed-upon buffer area that lies some 90 miles to the west of Rmelan. The public affairs office for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria subsequently confirmed the attack occurred to Military Times on Nov. 4, but stressed that the incoming rounds landed approximately just over a mile from American troops and caused no casualties. There have been an uptick in such incidents recently, but there have been periodic skirmishes between the TFSA and U.S. personnel and their SDF partners for years now . The Russian announcement of this latest incident is also a reflection of the fact that that country’s troops have already begun to conduct patrols along the Syrian side of the border in accordance with the deal between Moscow and Ankara. This means they are now routinely operating just miles from where American troops and their SDF partners are present in Rmelan, as well. There has been a steady flow of pictures and videos showing U.S. and Russian forces passing by each other in northern Syria. Russia has also now occupied a number of forward operating locations that American personnel have abandoned in recent weeks. It is unclear what, if any, immediate mechanisms are in place to deconflict any of these activities. “All Coalition military operations are de-conflicted with other forces operating in the region,” the U.S.-led coalition told Military Times in a statement in regards to the Tel Tamir incident. “Coalition forces maintain their inherent right to self-defense to ensure the success of our operations while prioritizing the safety of our troops.” Still, it is not clear just how readily able troops on the ground can put these mechanisms into action to avert potentially serious misunderstandings in the field. U.S. Central Command does continue to operate a high-level deconfliction hotline with its Russian counterparts in Syria, which it recently used to help clear the way for special operations forces taking part in the raid that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Oct 26, 2019. The U.S.-led coalition was also able to contact Turkish officials last month to call off an artillery attack that threatened American positions near the Turkish border last month, but this came after the Pentagon had insisted that Turkey was aware of the exact locations of all U.S. personnel in the country. Three M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles from 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry, a unit of the South Carolina Army National Guard, after arriving in Syria’s Deir Ez Zor province on Oct. 31, 2019., US Army Of course, beyond the potential for altercations between U.S. forces and Turkish and Turkish-backed forces, as well as Russian personnel and their Syria allies, there is also the persistent threat of terrorist attacks. ISIS, despite the recent loss of Baghdadi and his second in command, Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, looks to be poised to make gains as U.S. and SDF attention has shifted to responding to Turkey’s intervention. Other terrorist groups, such as Al Qaeda’s franchise in the country, could also exploit the chaotic situation, which has produced a new humanitarian crisis , as well. All told, while patrolling oil and gas-related sites seems to be an increasingly significant mission for the American forces that remain in Syria, the situation in the country remains extremely complicated and often confusing, overall. It is very possible that the character of U.S. operations could evolve yet again in the near future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The SR-71 Blackbird continues to capture the public’s imagination like no other aircraft on Earth even two decades after it was retired. Any new stories , video , pilot interviews , historical tidbit , or whatever about the jet are gobbled up like fine desserts by fans of the plane, or of just engineering, technology, and history, in general. Case in point the crazy photo above. The image’s backstory is unknown, as far as I can tell ( see update at the bottom of this post ). It popped up in my Twitter feed after @Kobaz4 posted it and I retweeted it with what was probably pretty much everyone else’s reaction: It shows a Blackbird with a Skunk Works tail-flash maneuvering relatively low over a populated area at twilight with full afterburner selected. The only way to capture such a shot was with high-speed, grainy film, but that quality actually adds to the photo’s mystique, in my opinion. Multiple SR-71’s wore the Skunk Works tail flash, so it is near impossible to understand what aircraft this was. Best guess was it was a test bird out of Palmdale towards the end of the SR-71’s career, but that is just a wild guess. The Blackbird’s Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet engines were one of the biggest triumphs of aerospace development in the history of manned flight. Their thrust wasn’t extreme by today’s standards—they put about the same amount in afterburner and in military power on the test stand as an F119 engine in an F-22—but they were specially designed to retain high thrust at extreme speeds beyond Mach 3 and very high altitudes, double that of what a fighter typically flew at. They also ran on special JP-7 fuel and were capable of burning special additives to create a stealthy cloud of plasma behind them to hide from enemy radars. All of this happened internally, of course, but one of the coolest byproducts of the J58’s operation was its huge afterburner plume that included a string of shock diamonds measuring dozens of feet trailing from behind the Blackbird’s barrel-like exhaust. During the day, the Blackbird’s burners looked awesome, but at night, it turned the SR-71 into something that looked otherworldly. This is probably the best shot I have seen that captures this. In fact, it is probably the best photo that shows off the incredible thrust that made the “Sled” slide through the atmosphere like a hot knife through butter, ever. UPDATE: The highest time SR-71 pilot ever, BC Thomas , reached out to me about the photo. Here is its awesome backstory: The photographer was Lt Col Bill Flanagan, taken from our SR-71 Flight Test T-38 chase plane #10363. Lt Col Tom Tilden was the T-38 pilot. I was the SR-71 pilot and my RSO was Lt Col JT Vida. The takeoff was from Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, CA, around 1986, with Palmdale in the background. Note the two small Mach diamond reflections, lower left, in the canopy of the T-38. The aircraft was #972, the SR-71 which graces the entrance to the Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum at Dulles International Airport, and the aircraft which holds the world’s speed record coast-to-coast (Lt Cols Ed Yeilding and JT Vida crew). So, there you go! We now know the origin of this amazing photograph. You can read about one of BC’s most eventful SR-71 missions in this piece I published with him in 2016.

The combat dog that was injured in the successful raid against ISIS kingpin Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has become the face of the historic operation, with President Trump tweeting repeatedly about the super pooch. As predicted, the Belgian Malinois named Conan is set to meet the President at the White House this week. Now the dog has now become the subject of a wild Saturday Night Live sketch, where a real dog playing Conan ‘took questions’ in the White House Briefing Room. The sketch was pretty funny as there is always a lot of unpredictability when animal actors take the live stage. The “translations” the military “dog interpreter,” played by Cecily Strong, provided pretty damn hilarious, too. Check it out: Maybe the best line was Conan summing up what missions like the one that killed al-Baghdadi are like as a special operations dog. The reporter asks “How does it feel to be getting all the credit for killing Baghdadi?” To which Conan replies—through his dog interpreter—“Honestly, it was a team effort from day one. It’s always been, I sniff your ass, you sniff mine.” It will be big news when the real Conan gets the red-carpet treatment at the White House this week. Stay tuned!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Army Medevac Black Hawks In Syria Are Flying With Unique Laser Countermeasures Installation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged that appear to be among the first to show U.S. Army HH-60M medical evacuation, or “Dustoff,” helicopters flying in Syria with a unique interim directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system configuration. Two years ago, the service had hit setbacks in integrating this defensive suite, known as AN/AAQ-24, onto its Black Hawks, as well as AH-64 Apaches and CH-47F Chinook helicopters, which it planned to use until it was able to field a new system of its own across all of its aviation units. The U.S. Marine Corps released the pair of HH-60M pictures on Oct. 31, 2019, with the caption saying that they showed the aircraft at an “undisclosed location” in Syria. Newsy ‘s Jake Godin, who was among the first to spot them, wrote on Twitter that the location looked similar to a known base in the vicinity of the northern Syrian city of Sarrin. However, the other information provided indicates that the helicopters, which are from an unknown unit, are attached to elements of Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Central Command (SPMAGTF-CC). U.S. Marine Corps units rotate through deployments with this regional contingency force, which in turn has supported U.S.-led operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq over the years. The exact U.S. force posture in Syria remains extremely fluid more than three weeks after the Pentagon announced plans for a near-total withdrawal of American forces from the northeastern part of the country following the start of a Turkish operation. More recently, some U.S. troops have moved back into Syria to take up positions elsewhere, including guarding oil and gas fields in the eastern Deir Ez Zor province, as the overall character of the United States’ presence continues to evolve. Whatever the case, it’s not surprising that the HH-60Ms are carrying a directional infrared countermeasures system (DIRCM). There have long been concerns about terrorists or other militant groups in Syria, including militias aligned with the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Asad, employing shoulder-fired, heat-seeking, short-range surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems or MANPADS , against U.S. helicopters and other low-flying aircraft. These are threats that are present throughout the Middle East , as a whole, and well beyond. An Army HH-60M at an undisclosed location in Syria equipped with DIRCM system, part of which is visible just behind the drop tank suspended under the left stub wing., USMC The Dustoff Black Hawks, in this case, are equipped with a version of Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24 system, also known somewhat confusingly as the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) system. Despite its name, variants of the LAIRCM is in use on a wide variety of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft across the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force for more than a decade, including on the Air Force’s highly specialized VC-25A “Air Force One” and C-32A “Air Force Two” presidential jets. This configuration for the HH-60M consists primarily of six missile warning sensors and two turreted lasers, also known as Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies (GLTA). A centralized control system links it all together. Pictures show that the GLTAs are mounted, on each side of the helicopter, via what may be a single bracket, or two individual brackets mounted close together, attached to the underside of the fuselage. A close up of one of the HH-60Ms showing the mounting arrangement for the GLTAs., USMC This would provide an arc of coverage on either side, similar in general to how the AN/AAQ-24(V)25 is installed on Marine CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters. It works in the exact same way, as well, detecting incoming heat-seeking missiles via the warning sensors and then cueing the lasers to fire at the threat’s seeker head, blinding or confusing it and throwing the weapon off course. It’s not clear how widespread the use of this particular DIRCM system may or may not be on Army Black Hawks. The Army has been working on acquiring a standardized DIRCM system for all of its helicopter types since 2009, but the Common Infrared Countermeasures (CIRCM) program, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , experienced significant delays. The final CIRCM system, another Northrop Grumman design that uses laser turrets with distinct transparent “bubble” housings, is only now in the early phases of entering operational service. One of the first US Army UH-60M Black Hawks equipped with the CIRCM system. You can see the turrets on top of the fuselage, between the engine exhausts, and underneath the fuselage, in front of the red anti-collision light and two other antennas., US Army So, in 2017, the Army had, as an interim solution, turned to the existing and proven LAIRCM as an option for UH-60L and M Black Hawk variants, as well as its Apaches and Chinooks, operating in higher threat environments, such as Syria. That same year, pictures emerged of AH-64s in that country equipped with their own version of the AN/AAQ-24. A report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, released in January 2018, but covering developmental activities during the 2017 Fiscal Year, detailed a number of major issues with this interim program. You can read about them in greater depth in this past War Zone piece . A US Army AH-64 Apache gunship seen flying in the background of another one of the SPMAGTF-CC pictures from Syria, which is also equipped with a version of the AN/AAQ-24 LAIRCM that includes the two GLTAs installed on the tips of its stub wings., USMC “The Army began airworthiness and safety flights on the UH-60M” in Fiscal Year 2017, which ended on Sept. 30, 2017, the report explained. “Structural failure of the UH-60 M/L mounts for the GLTAs requires a redesign.” The Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation did not include an update on Army’s efforts to integrate the AN/AAQ-24 onto its helicopters in its report for the 2018 Fiscal Year, which it released earlier this year. The pictures from Syria clearly show that the structural issues were resolved to a sufficient degree for operational use and that some number of the service’s Black Hawks are flying with this DIRCM system. It is certainly better than nothing. It remains curious that the Army did not choose to go with the LAIRCM configuration found on the Marine Corps’ VH-60N VIP helicopters , which have the GLTAs mounted on the bottom of the fuselage. This may have had to do with a desire to preserve the standard UH-60’s sling load capabilities or requirements to keep the underside clear of obstructions. If that was the case, it is worth noting that the new CIRCM system on the Black Hawk includes one of the laser turrets installed underneath the fuselage. A US Marine Corps VH-60N with its version of the AN/AAQ-24 LAIRCM, which has the laser turrets on the bottom of the fuselage., AP Depending on how the fielding of the CIRCM system progresses, and how the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria does or doesn’t proceed, this particular DIRCM configuration for the Black Hawk may remain largely obscure. At the same time, it is possible that these systems could remain in depots in the region for continuing use, as necessary, even if the units using them now redeploy to lower threat countries or back to the United States entirely. In the meantime, though, these two HH-60Ms, at least, will continue to use this particular defensive configuration to help protect them from the potential threat of MANPADS.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019",Guided Rounds Will Turn The Beloved Carl Gustaf Recoilless Rifle Into A Precision Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saab successfully tested a precision-guided round for its M3E1 Carl Gustaf recoilless rifles earlier this year and is set to demonstrate it for U.S. special operators next year. The new projectile will also double the maximum range of the weapon compared to when firing existing unguided ammunition, while still being safe to fire from enclosed spaces, such as from the window of a building. Military.com was first to get the updates on the new round after talking with Michael Höglund, head of Saab Dynamics’ Ground Combat Business Unit this week. The Swedish defense contractor teamed up with American firm Raytheon in 2017 to develop the precision-guided ammunition. Raytheon had displayed a mock-up of the round at the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual convention the following year. “The Guided Carl-Gustaf Munition is a next step in the evolution of the Carl-Gustaf system,” Görgen Johansson, head of Saab Dynamics, said in a subsequent press release. “It will be the most advanced Carl-Gustaf munition yet and will offer greater precision, minimise collateral damage and deliver outstanding performance with pin-point accuracy and multi-target capability.” The new guided round for the Carl Gustaf that Saab and Raytheon have been developing., Saab The current version that Saab and Raytheon have been testing looks largely unchanged externally from the one on display two years ago. It features two sets of pop-out fins to steer itself to the target. The new round also features a rocket motor giving is significant additional range. The precision-guided projectile hit two stationary targets nearly 4,600 feet away and a moving target at a range of just over 5,900 feet during tests at the Saab Bofors Test Centre in Karlskoga, Sweden, in September 2019, Höglund said, according to Military.com . None of the weapons in these tests had live warheads. A Raytheon press release said that the missile had successfully completed a total of 11 test flights, including some at the Mile High Range in Sierra Blanca, Texas, with no failures. Right now, the M3E1’s maximum range using existing ammunition options is around 3,280 feet. The goal is to eventually be able to demonstrate that the precision-guided round can effectively engage threats out to at least 6,560 feet, if not further, depending on the exact launch parameters. Even with this added range, Saab says that troops can still fire it from inside buildings or other confined areas without fear of the backblast damaging their position or even injuring them. Recoilless rifles already often have very large danger zones behind them during firing, to begin with, due to their specific method of operation, which you can read about in more detail in The War Zone ‘s past profile on the Carl Gustaf family. It’s not entirely clear how this “confined space” system works in the case of Saab and Raytheon’s guided round, but a video that Raytheon released of some of the testing, seen earlier in this story, shows that the round has a two-stage propulsion system with a small booster motor to first get it out of the launcher and to a safe distance before the main motor kicks in. Many man-portable guided anti-tank missile launchers, such as the U.S. military’s FGM-148 Javelin , use a similar propulsion arrangement. Being able to fire from inside a building or other constrained firing positions is extremely valuable, especially for fighting dense urban environments, which the U.S. military, among others see as an increasingly likely possibility in the future. Back in 2017, Saab and Raytheon had also said that the weapon would use semi-active laser guidance, which requires either the gunner firing the M3E1 or another individual to keep a laser beam pointed at the target until the moment of impact. Ty Blanchard, the program manager at Raytheon for what is formally known as the Guided Carl-Gustaf Munition, told Military.com that this is still the case, but that future seeker upgrades could give it a fire-and-forget capability. Saab’s press release says that it and Raytheon have already demonstrated other “seeker technolgoies” that could be applicable. This included imaging infrared, which the Javelin, a weapon Raytheon developed with Lockheed Martin, uses, according to that statement. There was no specific mention of millimeter-wave radar, but this is another popular option found on various smart munitions . It’s also not clear how much modification the existing M3E1 may or may not need to be able to fire the round. It may be as simple as adding a new sighting system to the launcher, which could then transmit any necessary pre-launch information to the round wirelessly, which is how a number of existing programmable ammunition types work already. Saab also offers the latest version of the Carl Gustaf with a digital sighting system with an integrated laser range finder and ballistic computer. An M3E1 Carl Gustaf equipped with a computerized sighting system., US Army Right now, Saab and Raytheon are preparing for at least three more tests of the guided round next spring with live warheads. We don’t know what the warhead configuration will be, but two years ago Saab and Raytheon said that the projectile would have a tandem warhead , which could be useful against armored targets and hardened structures. The tandem warhead arrangement could help it defeat certain add-on armor packages on vehicles, including explosive reactive armor, or break through the wall of a building or a bunker before the second warhead detonates within for maximum effect. This kind of capability would fit well with the three upcoming test targets, which are three layers of brick wall, an eight-inch section of reinforced concrete, and an up-armored sport utility vehicle, Blanchard said, according to Military.com . “Raytheon and Saab have spent the last 12 months working together to develop a precision-guided munition that will penetrate multiple targets, such as light armor, bunkers and concrete structures, at extended ranges,” Sam Deneke, Raytheon Land Warfare Systems’ Vice President, also said in a statement . “This lightweight round can overmatch potential adversaries while decreasing collateral damage, making it an ideal weapon when fighting under restricted rules of engagement.” The test shots are part of a $2.5 million rapid innovation contract that the two companies received from the U.S. Army , in support of a U.S. Special Operations Command requirement, last year to continue the development of the precision-guided ammunition. The U.S. special operations community were the first within the U.S. military to begin using the Carl Gustaf, which has been popular around the world for decades. A US Army Green Beret from the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) fires a Carl Gustaf during a training exercise., US Army However, regular U.S. Army units, as well as those in the U.S. Marine Corps, are now also increasingly using these weapons, as well. In 2017, the Army notably approved a purchase order of more than 1,000 of the launchers. Both of these services will no doubt be interested in the precision-guided round, as well. As noted, the Carl Gustaf family of launchers is in widespread use around the world, which means there is a well-established potential export market for guided ammunition, too. Saab said that the tests in September had been “in the presence of an international audience.” The cost of the rounds could be an important factor in future sales. Precision guided missiles can be exorbitantly expensive, leading commanders to be reticent to use them, except when absolutely necessary, which was one of the driving factors in the Army’s decision to adopt of the Carl Gustaf for widespread use two years ago. A single Javelin missile costs around $80,000 . By comparison, the costliest unguided ammunition for the M3E1 is around $3,000 per shot. Still, even if Saab and Raytheon’s guided projectile is just as expensive as something like the Javelin, that may not be as problematic for cost-conscious customers given that the Carl Gustafs can still readily fire the existing suite of unguided ammunition. This includes anti-tank, general-purpose high explosive, and white phosphorus smoke shells, as well as ones containing illuminating flares. There is another one for specifically for engaging threats inside hardened structures and a “close-in protection” round for targeting enemy troops in the open loaded with 1,100 small metal darts, also known as flechettes. A display showing the wide selection of unguided ammunition already available for the Carl Gustaf. The “close-in protection” round is third from the right. A disposal AT-4 recoilless rifle, another Saab product that is effectively a single-shot derivative of the Carl Gustaf, is seen above., Joseph Trevithick This high degree of flexibility means that even small units could carry a variety of different ammunition and save expensive precision-guided options for situations that specifically require the added range or moving target engagement capability. Those same forces would be able to more readily switch between different types of rounds while still maintaining a greater volume of fire than could be achieved using guided anti-tank missile launchers. All told, Raytheon and Saab appear to be making good progress on developing this new precision-guided round, which could significantly increase the capabilities of the already beloved Carl Gustaf.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 16, 2020",These T-72 Tank “Costumes” For Idaho Army National Guard Humvees Aren’t For Halloween,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the obvious joys of Halloween is being able to dress up in fantastic or ridiculous costumes and enjoy the night out with your friends. So, it seems somehow very appropriate that the Idaho Army National Guard recently chose to highlight how it has been dressing up Humvees in their own “costumes” of sorts so they can masquerade as low-cost substitutes for Russian-designed T-72 tanks and 8×8 BTR-90 wheeled armored personnel carriers during training exercises. The Idaho Army National Guard recently worked together with WestEfx to transform a dozen M1097 Humvees into a mix of surrogate T-72s and BTR-90s at the Orchard Combat Training Center. The California-headquartered company, which now has a dedicated military services division for this kind of work, started out first doing special effects for commercials, music videos, and Hollywood movies, including blockbusters such as Men In Black II and recent entries in the Taken and James Bond series. The firm has been working with various National Guard units since 2018, when the main National Guard Bureau first hired it to help with improving its the Exportable Combat Training Capability program, or XCTC. “We will be able to train against a realistic enemy,” Sergeant 1st Class Clinton Doramus, who manages the Idaho Army National Guard’s fleet of “visually modified” vehicles, or VISMODS, at the Orchard Combat Training Center said in a statement . “These kits aren’t going to look and act like a Humvee. They are going to look and act like T-72s and BTR-90s.” Members of WestEfx Military Services work to install a T-72 VISMOD kit on an Idaho Army National Guard M1097 Humvee., Idaho Army National Guard WestEfx’s kits primarily consist of lightweight framing holding fabric coverings and inflatable features that, when installed on a standard Humvee, mimic the visual signature and silhouette of the vehicle in question. The T-72 version also has a rotating turret assembly and others make use of the Humvee’s own turret to provide a simulated weapons station. In addition to the T-72 and BTR-90 offerings, the company has developed ones that mimick 6×6 and 4×4 wheeled armored vehicles, such as the Soviet-era BDRM-2. Some of these will also work with commercial pickup trucks, rather than Humvees, underneath, as well. The various vehicles also feature gas-operated mock weapons and smoke generators to add to the realism. These vehicles are fully compatible with the Army’s Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System, or MILES . This is a family of training devices that attach to various vehicles and weapon systems that allow for troops to “fire” at each other and register “hits” and “kills” during exercises. WestEfx’s website doesn’t say anything about the kits being able to mimic the signature of the real vehicle in question when viewed through sensors such as infrared or thermal cameras. The modified Humvee, even with the added weight of the kit, around 1,700 pounds in the case of the T-72 version, is unlikely to give the exact appearance of a heavier armored vehicle while it’s on the move, either. That’s not to say that the kits still don’t offer an important measure of realism during training exercises and give National Guard units and opportunity to square off against simulated enemies riding in vehicles that don’t just look like their own. Perhaps most importantly, it also allows smaller training centers, such as the Orchard Combat Training Center, the ability to offer these kinds of capabilities without the costs and complexities associated with maintaining either actual examples of the vehicles troops might encounter in combat, which has only ever occurred on a very limited level historically , or higher fidelity surrogates. The kits can be more readily swapped between Humvees, as necessary, such as if one breaks down during an exercise. US military personnel set up an actual Soviet-era Scud short-range ballistic missile transporter-erector-launcher, which American forces had captured in Iraq in 1991, with a dummy missile during a training exercise nicknamed Roving Sands in 1997., DOD “No enhanced battlefield training simulators can compare with the functionality, realism, durability, and cost-effectiveness of this new VisMod vehicle,” WestEfx’s owner and lead designer of the kits, Erick Brennan, said. “They are pretty amazing and we are really proud of them.” The U.S. Army has, for years , employed an array of very high fidelity VISMODs at large training centers, especially the National Training Center in California, in addition to actual foreign-made vehicles that it has obtained from various sources. In the past, these VISMOD fleets were largely centered around retired M551 Sheridan light tanks modified to look similar to T-72 tanks, BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, and even ZSU-23-4 Shilka self-propelled anti-aircraft guns. A convoy of M551 VISMODs on the move at the National Training Center in 1986. In from is one configured to look like a BMP-2 fighting vehicle, followed by one in the ZSU-23-4 configuration. A number of “tank” variants are following behind., US Army The underlying M551s eventually became difficult to operate and sustain and the Army switched to M113A3 armored personnel carriers in various “Opposing Forces Surrogate Vehicle” configurations. Also known as OSVs, these vehicles come in variations intended to mimic Russian tanks in the T-72 and T-80 families , as well as BMP-2s. There is also a more robust OSV conversion for the Humvee to transform it into a BDRM-2 look-a-like. An M113A3-based OSV modified to look like a BMP-2, as well as Humvee configured to mimic a BDRM-2., US Army An M113A3 OSV in the “tank” configuration., US Army These are still costly options. They’re kits are also definitely less expensive than using more modern American-made armored vehicles to play the role of enemy forces during exercises – and that’s if there are even enough available to fully equip a sufficiently large opposing force to meet certain exercise requirements. “A Humvee costs approximately $30,000 plus another maybe $5,000 to maintain for the year, whereas an M1A1 tank costs a lot more,” Doramus, the Idaho Army National Guard Sergeant 1st Class said. “It’s initial and maintenance expenses that make these kits a lot more cost-effective to do on Humvees than tanks or Bradleys. Plus the Army doesn’t just have 60 spare tanks sitting around somewhere.” A Humvee-turned-BTR-90. The underlying vehicle’s CROWS II remote weapon station is seen above., WestEfx Military Services As it stands now, WestEfx is under contract to supply up to 48 kits to the National Guard Bureau for use at sites around the country over the next three years. These will all be part of the XCTC program, which supports 21-day mobilization combat training exercises that National Guard units go through before deploying overseas . So, unlike an actual Halloween costume, we may be seeing more of these spooky adversaries all year long in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Crash trucks at the Royal Netherlands Air Force’s Leeuwarden Air Base were supposed to provide a water cannon salute to mark the arrival of the country’s first operational F-35A Joint Strike Fighter to be based in the country, but covered it in firefighting foam by accident instead. The base firefighters had reportedly responded to an actual emergency involving an F-16 Viper fighter jet earlier and forgot to switch back to shooting regular water for the ceremony. The F-35A arrived at Leeuwarden at around 3:30 PM local time and landed after flying a lap around the base, according to an official press release . The jet had flown from the final assembly and checkout (FACO) facility in Italy, where Leonardo had assembled it under license from the primary manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The Dutch Air Force already has eight other Joint Strike Fighters, but they are all in the United States where they support test and pilot training activities. Those aircraft have made multiple visits to the Netherlands since 2016, but are not permanently based in the country. The country is buying 46 of the jets in total, including nine more it agreed to purchase just this month . Amusingly, despite including pictures clearly showing the mixup, the official release makes no mention of the mixup. The foam is seen dripping from the plane as the pilot, Ian Knight, the commander of the 323 Test & Evaluation Squadron, exits the aircraft to greet a crowd including various government dignitaries. “The air base fire department was on standby for the water salute when they were called to an actual emergency with an F-16,” according to Reddit user krijgnog5eurovanje . “When they returned for the water salute they forgot to switch from ‘foam’ to ‘water.'” Dutch Ministry of Defense Dutch Ministry of Defense It’s not clear what this might mean for the aircraft, which ingested some of the foam into the engine intakes and the engine itself, as it taxied to the ceremony area after the impromptu foam party. Reports regarding past military aviation mishaps involving the accidental release of firefighting foam onto aircraft in hangars typically say that firefighting crews later used water to wash it away without any mention of serious lasting effects. Whether that applies to stealthy aircraft, such as the F-35, which have very sensitive external features, especially the specialized radar-absorbing coatings that cover their skin, is unclear. The foam bath certainly didn’t appear to dampen the spirits of those who attended the ceremony. Dutch Air Force Lieuentant Colonel Laurens-Jan ‘Sjoak’ Vijge gave a brief speech to the crowd in which he explained his own experience of flying the F-35 for the first time. “Holy crap! For a moment, I felt like a teenager on a very cool skateboard in Florida,” Vijge said, referring to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where Dutch Joint Strike Fighter pilots have been training for years now, according to the official press release. “This thing flies like a rocket.” “A little over 40 years ago, the first Dutch F-16 was welcomed here. It was called ‘the aircraft of the future.'” Dutch Defense Secretary Barbara Visser said in her own remarks at the ceremony. Leeuwarden will now serve as the Dutch base at the center of the country’s next major leap forward in aerial combat capability. The F-35A flying around Leeuwarden before landing., Dutch Ministry of Defense Hopefully, the first experience that personnel at Leeuwarden have with this new operational jet won’t be having to strip it down to remove any traces of the mistaken foam salute.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 14, 2019",Check Out These Shots Of America’s New Supercarrier Ripping Through High-Speed Turns,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Ford class supercarrier program has been a massive boondoggle , which I have been reporting on it at great length for years, and the problems it is experiencing were so avoidable one can’t help but cringe. Putting those issues aside, or the fact that a single ship costs $13B —it’s the most expensive warship ever made, in fact, it’s the most expensive weapon ever made—it is pretty damn cool looking. These photos, which show the 1,106-foot long nuclear-powered ship executing some impressive high speed turns and heading out on sea trials following a long servicing period, are the best I have seen of her yet. USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN Visually speaking, the Ford class varies substantially from the Nimitz class configuration that proceeded in multiple ways. Ford’s angular and smaller island superstructure is set farther back by 140 feet, opening up a large amount of deck space in front of it. The island is set so far back that it is a bit offputting at first as it looks quite close to the landing area. Regardless, it redefines the classic silhouette of the American nuclear-powered supercarrier. USN USN USN There are six flush-mounted active electronically scanned arrays (AESA) on the island that make up the ship’s new Dual Band Radar, which will be short-lived production-wise, with it only planned to be installed on two of the Ford class carriers. It will be replaced with the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) starting on future USS Enterprise (CVN-80). You can read all about this new system in this past piece of ours . Generally speaking, the island has an overall cleaner and more svelte look. Even the mast atop the island is less cluttered than what we are used to seeing due to the Dual Band Radar, among other factors. Because of these changes, there are now two aircraft elevators on the starboard side of the carrier, both of which are situated in front of the island. Another one is located on the opposite side of the ship on its aft waist area. In comparison, the Nimitz class has four aircraft elevators, an interesting development considering the purpose of Ford’s new design is to supposedly increase sortie rates and ease movement around the deck. USN USN Another big change in appearance is caused by the big ‘wing’ platforms that extend from the rear of Ford’s hangar deck. These significantly expand the service spaces in the carrier’s hangar bay and also offer large platform areas on each side of the ship that can be used to accommodate new weapons and sensors over the ship’s planned 50-year service life. It looks a bit awkward from some angles, but having the space available to support things like directed energy weapons and possibly even a future vertical launch system , among so many other possibilities, is pretty exciting. USN Here are some shots of Ford leaving port for its latest round of sea trials: USN USN USN USN USN USN USN After examining this set of photos taken on Ford ‘s latest shakedown cruise, two questions come to mind. First off, I don’t see any electronic warfare systems fitted. Neither the SLQ-32 SEWIP or SLQ-59/62 are seen in their usual spots. This could be because electronic warfare systems are not needed yet and will be fitted later on. An operational deployment for the ship is still years away (as far off as 2024!). It is possible that the SLQ-32 Block II is actually fitted atop the mast in a large eight-sided enclosure. This would be a far higher mounting position than we have ever seen for a carrier electronic warfare system. You can read all about the Block II variant of the SEWIP here . The second thing I noticed is that there are no target illuminators dispersed around the ship to guide RIM-166 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs). ESSM Block II does not need an illuminator as it can be guided via data-link—you can read all about ESSM Block II in this past article of ours—but as far as I know, it is too heavy for the Mk 29 launchers found on carriers and big-deck amphibious assault ships. Mk29 launcher firing a ESSM aboard a Nimitz class carrier. Note the target illuninator below the launcher paltform. , USN Maybe Ford’s launchers are upgraded and/or its dual-band radar can provide target illumination. The latter is more likely the case as the Block I ESSM can be guided by the SPY-1 phased array radars on U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, as well as other allied ships that use other phased array radars. Ford has already come back from its short shakedown cruise. How everything went remains unclear, but with so much focus on the troubled ship, we should find out soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 31, 2020",Army National Guard Bradley Fighting Vehicles Are Now In Syria Guarding Oil And Gas Fields,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than three weeks after the United States announced it would be withdrawing the bulk of its forces from Syria, a contingent of U.S. Army National Guard M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and other troops have traveled aboard U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft to a forward position in Deir Ez Zor in the eastern portion of that country. This also comes just days after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi during a U.S. special operations raid in Syria. This new deployment appears to be the first wave of heavy armored forces headed to the area as part of plan , aimed at ensuring that ISIS and the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad do not regain control of oil and gas fields in that province, which the Pentagon formally announced last week. NBC News first reported the deployment early on Oct. 31, 2019. U.S. Army Colonel Myles Caggins, the top spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, Tweeted out three pictures of U.S. personnel loading a Bradley from the South Carolina Army National Guard’s 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry onto a C-17 at an unspecified base in the Middle East later that day. The base in question appears to be Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait based on hardened aircraft shelters and other features seen in the background. Caggins also included a fourth picture showed one of the battalion’s M2A2s on a training range in Kuwait earlier in the week. The social media post did say specifically that troops from 4-118th were headed to Deir Ez Zor. . @USArmy troops in 4-118th Infantry Regiment, @30thabct , @NCNationalGuard attached to the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, @SCNationalGuard , load M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles to support the @CJTFOIR mission in Deir ez Zor, Syria. #DefeatDaesh pic.twitter.com/ZbFsvIemRW — OIR Spokesperson (@OIRSpox) October 31, 2019 “What we want to do is ensure that ISIS is not able to regain possession of any of the oil fields that would allow them to gain income going forward,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, had told reporters regarding the overall plan during a press conference on Oct. 30, 2019. “As of right now, we have secured the oil fields at Deir Ez Zor, generally east of the Euphrates River, in the vicinity of [the] Conoco [Gas Plant] and Green Village.” A map showing the general zones of influence in Syria as of March 2019.

Additional American personnel in M-ATVs moved into Syria from Iraq on Oct. 31, 2019, as well, but it is not clear if they are also headed further east. #EXCLUSIVE : US special forces in an area of northern #Syria near the Turkish border conduct a patrol between the towns of Rimelan and Tirbespiye, outside Qamishli. (Photos: Kurdistan 24/Akram Salih) #TwitterKurds #Turkey pic.twitter.com/gpC2Df4RYs — Kurdistan 24 English (@K24English) October 31, 2019 However, on Oct. 25, 2019, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had confirmed that the final force posture in Deir Ez Zor would include “some mechanized forces,” a term that typically refers to tanks or other heavy armored vehicles. Previous reports, citing unnamed sources, had said that M1 Abrams tanks would also be among this particular group of troops. 4-118th is a combined arms battalion equipped with both Bradleys and Abrams and had those vehicles with it when it deployed to Kuwait sometime earlier in the month. The battalion is part of the Army National Guard’s 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team, the bulk of which is part of the North Carolina National Guard, but which also includes troops from the South Carolina and West Virginia Army National Guards. The 30th began arriving in Kuwait last week to relieve the regular Army 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. An M2A2 Bradley, at left, and three M1 Abrams tanks belonging to 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry conduct routine training in Kuwait on Oct. 28, 2019., US Army National Guard The Army always has a forward-deployed armored brigade in that country as part of Operation Spartan Shield . Forces deployed in support of this operation are on call to be able to respond to any potential contingency in the Middle East and the War Zone had posited last week that whatever brigade was deployed to Kuwait was the most likely force provider for the new mission in Deir Ez Zor. Units from the various brigades that have rotated through this deployment over the years have already taken part in operations in Syria. It is not clear yet whether the battalion is also sending some of its tanks into Syria. The M2A2s, with their 25mm automatic cannons and TOW anti-tank missiles, are certainly better armed and armored than lighter vehicles, such as M-ATVs. They also have a more robust suite of sensors that will help troops monitor the areas around their positions, especially at night. However, the Bradleys would still not offer the same anti-armor capability as even a small group of M1s with their 120mm main guns, which could be important if the force finds itself facing off against a more conventionally armed opponent. In 2018, a force aligned with the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad, with the support of Russian mercenaries and equipped with tanks and heavy artillery, notably attempted to eject American forces and their local partners from a position near the Conoco Gas Plant in Deir Ez Zor. A massive counterattack involving air and artillery strikes was necessary to repel that threat. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jh1oe_Kdx8c The full size and scope of force that will take up positions in Deir Ez Zor remains unclear, as well. Previous estimates have ranged anywhere from 200 to 700 troops in total, which would be in addition to U.S. personnel who have been occupying the position near the Conoco Gas Plant since at least the beginning of 2018. “We’ve got forces at Deir ez-Zor, that is – we have brought in some reinforcements there,” General McKenzie had said on Oct. 30. “We’ll await further decisions of the U.S. government about how that plan is going to look in the long term.” It’s also important to note that this deployment very publicly shifts what had been a U.S. special operations forces-led mission in Syria to a more outwardly conventional military operation. Of course, conventional forces had been supporting special operators for years in large numbers and had been assisting local forces in what was already a largely conventional conflict . The exact scope of the mission has been a matter of debate, as well. As McKenzie had said, the primary official goal was to prevent ISIS from retaking the area, which could be a potentially lucrative source of income for the terrorists. It has also been widely reported that the Pentagon is eager to ensure that Assad and his regime in Damascus, as well as its Russian and Iranian allies, cannot take advantage of these resources, which had been a major source of income for Syria in the past, and otherwise cannot reassert themselves in the eastern part the country. With regards to ISIS, despite the recent loss of its leader in a U.S. special operations raid, and its second in command , in an airstrike soon thereafter, there are concerns that this group may be regaining strength amid the chaos in Syria that a Turkish intervention in the north that began earlier this month has unleashed. Turkey’s operation has targeted the U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have been instrumental in rolling back ISIS, and have drawn their attention away from that mission. It also precipitated a hasty withdrawal of American forces from much of northeastern Syria. The Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad, together with its Russian and Iranian allies, has also made territorial gains and could be looking to launch a new push to retake Deir Ez Zor. US personnel load a mine-resistant vehicle into a C-17 at the Kobane Landing Zone in Syria on Oct. 24, 2019, as part of the withdrawal of American forces from northeastern Syria., US Army However, President Donald Trump, as well as members Congress, have also indicated that the United States may be looking to find some way to help reestablish more robust oil and gas extraction operations in Deir Ez Zor, which could involve American companies. “What I intend to do, perhaps, is make a deal with an Exxon Mobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly,” Trump had said on Oct. 27 , amid remarks regarding the operation that led to the death of Baghdadi. “This is a win-win: The SDF will get more money if we can modernize the oil fields,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and major political ally of President Trumps, who was initially critical of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, said on Oct. 29. “We’re not going over there to enrich America – we’re over there to help our allies, deny our enemy resources that will allow them to get stronger over time and finally – and this is O.K. – to lower the cost to us.” There are questions about whether this oil-and-gas-related mission is even legal under existing U.S. and international laws. Russia has, unsurprisingly, already criticized the American plan as violating Syrian sovereignty. Russian Defence Ministry comments on the statement of the head of the Pentagon on the retention of the US military personnel group in Eastern Syria, allegedly “to prevent Islamic State access to oil fields” https://t.co/E3FynD0ECP #mod pic.twitter.com/kz8c8dXS2i — Минобороны России (@mod_russia) October 26, 2019 Reports, citing anonymous sources, have also indicated that the U.S. military deliberately framed the issue around those resources in order to win President Trump’s support for remaining Syria to combat ISIS and to prevent Assad and his allies from regaining control of the eastern part of the country. Trump had originally announced his intention to fully withdraw American forces from the country in December 2018. Experts also debate just how lucrative the oil in Deir Ez Zor might be for anyone, given that production there has historically been low in both quantity and quality. Still, while it hasn’t been a major factor in global oil markets, it had provided up to 25 percent of the the Syrian regime’s total annual revenues in the past and could be equally valuable for a small, non-state actor, such as ISIS. The SDF itself has been working with Syrians tied to Assad in order to sell the oil anyway, for lack of other realistic options, though the U.S. government might be looking now at ways to cut out these middlemen for good. As the War Zon e noted in its initial reporting , questions also remain about just how viable a U.S. presence of any kind will be in Deir Ez Zor in the long term. These positions could be especially precarious if they become increasingly isolated as American forces withdraw from much of the rest of the country, ceding territory to other actors in the process. You can read more in detail about the complex logistical and force protection issues involved in our previous story here . Regardless, the U.S. force posture in Deir Ez Zor, at least for the time being, will now feature M2A2 Bradleys and could be home to other U.S. heavy armored forces soon.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 28, 2019",Our Analysis Of New Info And Video From The Raid That Killed ISIS Head Al Baghdadi,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The top U.S. commander in the Middle East has now briefed reporters on the U.S. special operations raid this past weekend that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an isolated compound near a village located close to the Turkish border in western Syria. The presentation also included video footage showing portions of the raid as it occurred and the subsequent destruction of the compound after the operation was complete. President Donald Trump had already offered significant information about the raid, as had press reports before and after, which you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting on the operation. Here are the basic new details that U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), provided on Oct. 30, 2019: CENTCOM, with approval from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley, briefed President Trump on the details of the planned raid on Oct. 25, 2019, the day before its execution. CENTCOM leadership, from the command’s headquarters in Florida, ordered the raid to commence at approximately 9:00 PM EST on Oct. 26, 2019. The plan included the assumption that children would be at the compound during the raid. This was a U.S.-only operation and no personnel from any other countries or non-state groups, such as the Syrian Democratic Forces, were involved. The heliborne task force traveled to and from the compound from a pre-staged, but unspecified location within Syria. The total flight time from that staging base to the compound in Barisha in Syria’s Idlib province was approximately one hour. An official map the U.S. military released showing the general location of Baghdadi’s compound in Barisha, Syria., CENTCOM A screengrab from video surveillance of the compound during the raid., CENTCOM Armed helicopters, unmanned “strike aircraft,” and fourth- and fifth-generation manned fighter jets provided air cover for the raid. U.S. officials contacted both Turkish and Russian authorities for deconfliction purposes only ahead of the raid. Militants, which the U.S. military does not believe were ISIS-affiliated and who had been in two separate nearby positions, reacted to the raiding force arriving at the objective. They fired on the raiding force as it approached and escorting gunship helicopters neutralized both groups with two separate airstrikes. An annotated map from Google Earth showing the approximate locations of the compound, the blue arrow, and the fighters that U.S. forces engaged during the raid, the red arrow, roughly a third of a mile away, based on the available information from the U.S. military and other sources., Google Earth The U.S. military does not know how many of these other fighters were killed in the operation or what group or groups they were affiliated with. U.S. special operations forces then established a perimeter around the compound. They urged the occupants to come out peacefully in Arabic. This annotated map from Google Earth shows the vector the raiding force took to get to the compound., Google Earth A group consisting of an unknown number of non-combatants, but which contained 11 children, was initially detained and later released. Two additional men were detained and remain detained at an unknown location. The raiding force killed one man and five women who “were behaving in a threatening manner” and did not respond to Arabic commands to surrender and warning shots. At least some of these individuals were wearing suicide vests. There were also concerns that the compound was booby-trapped. The U.S. military now says that only two children died when Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest, not three as was initially reported. The military working dog on the mission was injured as a result of coming into contact with exposed wires in the tunnel. The dog, which is a male, is a four year veteran of the U.S. Special Operations Command K-9 program and has been on approximately 50 missions. The dog, the name of which has not been officially released, has returned to duty. Baghdadi’s remains were buried at sea “in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict” and within 24 hours of his death. Baghdadi’s identity was confirmed by checking DNA samples from the raid against an on-file sample from his internment at Camp Bucca in Iraq in 2004. There is only a 1 in 104 septillion chance that the DNA is not from Baghdadi. An unclassified briefing slide from the Defense Intelligence Agency regarding the positive identification of Baghdadi., DIA An unmanned aircraft employed unspecified munitions against the compound initially. “U.S. standoff munitions” were employed to completely destroy it and left the site looking “pretty much like a parking lot with large potholes right now.” A declassified video of the subsequent airstrikes on the compound to destroy it show at least six individual munitions. The total destruction of the compound was aimed at trying to ensure that it would not become a shrine or pilgrimage site for militants in the future. Satellite imagery from September 2018, at left, and from after the raid in October 2019, showing the totality of the destruction., Google Earth These additional details help clarify a number of additional points. Notably, the use of a staging base in Syria, something The War Zone had posited initially was extremely likely, as it explains how the helicopters were able to arrive within previously reported timeframes, as well as the one that President Donald Trump had disclosed in his own remarks on Oct. 27. While we don’t know where this staging location was, the U.S. military still had access at the time of the raid to a number of suitable facilities in Eastern Syria that would have been close enough for the helicopters to have made the trip in around an hour, including the Kobane Landing Zone . U.S. special operations forces could easily have established a temporary forward arming and refueling point, or FARP , from which to launch the mission, as well.

Heavily armed special operations MH-60M Black Hawk helicopters from the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, configured as so-called Direct Action Penetrators (DAPs), remain a very likely possibility. Depending on the forces available, regular U.S. Army AH-64 Apaches, which have been a regular part of U.S. operations in Syria in recent years, may also have provided this escort.

We still don’t know what aircraft were involved or where they flew from, but we do know that a variety of suitable platforms are forward deployed in the Middle East, including MQ-9 Reapers, fifth-generation F-22 Raptors and F-35A Joint Strike Fighters , and fourth-generation combat jets such as the F-15E Strike Eagle . However, these aircraft could have easily flown in from Turkey or any number of bases in continental Europe or the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, such as the island of Cyprus . Approaching from the east or the south is still a possibility, albeit a less likely one. Given the proximity of Baghdadi’s compound to the Turkish border – Barisha is less than five miles to the south – any aircraft that didn’t need to be flying overhead, such as the drones and helicopters providing overwatch support, would not have even had to enter Syria, necessarily. They could have been orbiting in Turkish airspace and still be in a position to be over the target area literally in a matter of seconds, if need be. We also still don’t know when and how an unknown number of AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ( JASSM ) cruise missiles were employed during the operation. The video that CENTCOM released that it says showed precision-guided “U.S. stand-off munitions” destroying the compound does not appear to show these weapons, but rather unpowered, guided bombs, such as GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). Depending on the release altitude, JDAMs can hit targets around 15 miles away, which would still have given them some stand-off range, especially, again, considering the location of the target to the Turkish border. They could have been dropped inside of Turkey and still hit their target with a large margin to spare. F-15E launching a JASSM., USAF The use of the JASSMs is puzzling, especially given the compound’s proximity to Turkey. The only reason we can think of as to why JASSMs would have been employed is if another strike was deemed necessary sometime after the entire operation wrapped up and all the contingency forces had left the area. Such an act would make some sense if bomb damage assessments showed that the compound was not destroyed to the level of satisfaction of commanders. Thus, another strike would be needed. Doing so with JASSM, which can be launched hundreds of miles away and needs no support of any kind to execute its mission, would make some sense under those circumstances. General McKenzie could not speak to the electronic or other forms of intelligence recovered at the scene, but said, not surprisingly, that it would be exploited to the full extent and would likely help in the targeting of other senior ISIS members. It is not clear whether or not any information acquired from Baghdadi’s compound contributed to other operations against the terrorist group’s leadership in the immediate aftermath of the raid in Barisha, including airstrikes that led to the death of Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir. Muhajir had been Baghdadi’s second in command and ISIS’ principal spokesperson. Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot – Now he is also Dead! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 Whatever the case, McKenzie stressed that the fight against ISIS was far from over. Still, the raid in Barisha definitely took out one of history most notorious terrorists and from everything we’ve learned today went relatively smoothly for such a complex and dangerous operation.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has approved the potential sale of a major upgrade package for a significant portion of Japan’s F-15J Eagle fleet that would bring them up to a standard called the Japanese Super Interceptor, or JSI. Jets in this configuration would get new active electronically scanned array radars, improved mission computers, updated electronic warfare suites , and more. The U.S. State Department approved the sale on Oct. 29, 2019, and the U.S. military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) subsequently notified Congress and issued a public notice . The possible deal, which covers 98 of the Japan Air Self Defense Force’s around 200 F-15Js, has an estimated value of $4.5 billion. It is important to note that this announcement does not automatically mean that the Japanese government will actually proceed with this purchase and that it would also have to negotiate the final terms of any relevant contracts. That being said, Japan has been publicly looking to upgrade at least a portion of its F-15J fleet for over a year and 2previous reports have already indicated the country’s preference for many of the systems described in the DSCA announcement, including Raytheon’s AN/APG-82(V)1 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and BAE Systems’ AN/ALQ-239 Digital Electronic Warfare System (DEWS). “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability, and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region,” DSCA said in its announcement . “This proposed sale will provide Japan a critical air defense capability to assist in defending the Japanese homeland and U.S. personnel stationed there. Modernized F-15J assets will better enable Japan to respond to airborne threats and defend its airspace.” A Japan Air Self Defense Force F-15J Eagle wearing a special commemorative paint scheme., Cp9asngf/wikicommons The proposed upgrade package includes the following according to the DSCA notice : The Government  of Japan has requested the upgrade of up to ninety-eight (98) F-15J aircraft to a Japanese Super Interceptor (JSI) configuration consisting of up to one hundred three (103) APG-82(v)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar (includes 5 spares); one hundred sixteen (116) Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II) Mission System Computer (includes 18 spares); and one hundred one (101) ALQ-239 Digital Electronic Warfare System (DEWS) (includes 3 spares). Also included are Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) with software, training and support; Selective Availability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM); ARC-210 radio, aircraft and munition integration and test support; ground training devices (including flight and maintenance simulators); support and test equipment; software delivery and support; spare and repair parts; communications equipment; facilities and construction support; publications and technical documentation; personnel training and training equipment; U.S. Government and contractor engineering; technical and logistics support services; studies and surveys; and other related elements of logistical and program support. The estimated total program cost is $4.5 billion. It is also important to note that DSCA said Boeing is, not surprisingly, already slated to be the prime contractor for this prospective deal through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. In addition, its notice says that Japan will source other unspecified items and services for this upgrade program via direct commercial sales with Japanese firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). MHI has been involved with the F-15J from the beginning , building various components and assembling the bulk of the aircraft in Japan under license from McDonnell Douglas/Boeing. The upgrades that DSCA has announced, which would come from Boeing, are extensive by themselves. The AN/APG-82(V)1 radar, formerly known as the AN/APG-63(V)4, is already becoming the standard on U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles. It will be found on that service’s upcoming F-15X, as well. Israel has also chosen this radar as part of an upgrade program for its F-15I Ra’am variant of the Eagle and it is a standard option for any country in the market for new, Advanced Eagle variants . The improved radar on the F-15J JSI is likely to be used in conjunction with new air-to-air missiles in the future. Japan already has the advanced AAM-4B , which has its own AESA seeker, but there are reports that the country might consider acquiring variants of the U.S.-made AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The AIM-120s are smaller than the AAM-4B and reportedly have a shorter maximum engagement range, but the F-15J JSI may be able to carry substantially more missiles of the American weapons, which could compensate for that relative loss of capability. https://youtube.com/watch?v=i7ejWPt7UK0 Beyond that, Japan is working with European missile consortium MBDA’s division in the United Kingdom to develop the Joint New Air-to-Air Missile ( JNAAM ). This weapon will reportedly leverage the seeker and other components of the AAM-4B together with features from MBDA’s ramjet-powered Meteor . With these new weapons, and potentially more of them in total, the F-15J JSI would be a valuable companion for Japan’s F-35As , offering a reliable alternative for performing routine air defense sorties. The stealthy Joint Strike Fighters could also work together with the upgraded Eagles, flying ahead and feeding targeting information to the non-stealthy jets, exploiting their greater load-carrying capacity. A JASDF F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., JASDF These are exactly the same sorts of benefits the U.S. Air Force is hoping to realize through a future force mix that includes both F-35s and F-15Xs. It would also align with the JASDF’s existing plans to only replace around half of its F-15J fleet with Joint Strike Fighters and continue flying the remaining Eagles for the foreseeable future. Improving the F-15J’s ability to spot, track, and engage aerial threats at extended ranges is important for ensuring that the Eagles will be able to continue in their primary mission of defending the airspace over and around Japan’s Home Islands and the country’s outlying territories. Aerial activity by potential adversaries, such as Russia and China who are now also conducting long-range patrols together, has been growing significantly in recent years. Japanese combat jets scrambled nearly 1,000 times in response to foreign military aircraft getting close to the country’s borders in 2018, nearly 100 more times than the year before. Of course, this is still fewer scrambles than occurred in 2016, a peak year when there were 1,168 such incidents. A graphic the Japanese Ministry of Defense released earlier in 2019 showing the areas where Chinese aircraft, in red, and Russian aircraft, in yellow, had approached its borders the year before., Japanese Ministry of Defense It is also worth pointing out that the APG-82(V)1 is optimized for multi-role missions. So, despite the Japanese Super Interceptor name, this may point to JASDF plans to expand the roles and missions of at least this portion of the F-15J fleet. In 2017, there had been reports that Japan was looking to potentially transform some of its Eagles into cruise missile carriers , exploiting the jet’s inherent range and payload capabilities to turn them into valuable stand-off strike assets. The proposed weapon of choice for this mission will reportedly be Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). However, this weapon’s range will well exceed that of the APG-82(V)1, meaning that this sensor will not be useful for targeting during certain long-range stand-off strikes. The F-15J JSI’s arsenal could still grow to include other ordnance, including anti-ship missiles, that might have more use of the radar’s air-to-surface capabilities. Japan is also buying U.S.-Norwegian-developed Joint Strike Missiles (JSM) for its F-35As, which could also find their way onto other aircraft and would make good use of the jet’s new radar. Concept art of an F-35 launching Joint Strike Missiles., Raytheon Regardless, as the War Zone has noted on multiple occasions in the past, Japan is facing a number of growing regional security concerns, including threats from North Korea and challenges to various territorial claims. It could be very valuable to have additional options for striking North Korean targets or helping to deter potential amphibious operations against disputed islands, such as the Senkakus in the East China Sea, which both China and South Korea claim , as well. With those latter concerns in mind, the APG-82(V)1 could further increase their air-to-ground capabilities and would also enable them to perform more robust maritime patrol and interdiction missions, if necessary. U.S. Air Force Strike Eagles were recently seen flying over the Persian Gulf in this exact capacity. The new Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II) Mission System Computer and AN/ALQ-239 DEWS will only further increase the capabilities of the Japanese Super Interceptor configuration. The DEWS is another system that Boeing has been offering on Advanced Eagle variants, including Saudi Arabia’s new F-15SAs . https://youtube.com/watch?v=xqkTYP4yAr0 The upgrade package that DSCA has described notably lacks any mention of other features that are becoming increasingly common on other modernized Eagles, including large, wide panel cockpit displays, improved heads-up-displays , and infrared search and track (IRST) sensors. With China, in particular, fielding growing numbers of J-20 stealth fighters and developing other manned and unmanned stealth platforms, an IRST capability would seem to be increasingly essential for the F-15J if the jets are to continue to perform the air defense mission for years to come. It is very possible that these and other items will be among those that will be sourced from Mitsubishi. Japan has already explored an integrated IRST system for the F-15J to some degree in the past and the country is also flight testing a podded system now. An integrated IRST system on an F-15J in 2008., Hunini via Wikimedia Japan could look to acquire some of these items, especially a podded IRST system that could also work with other combat aircraft in the JADSF’s inventory, as part of separate foreign military sales deals in the future, as well. It will be interesting to see what the complete Japanese Super Interceptor configuration looks like in the end and how it stacks up against other advanced F-15 variants entering service and Eagle modernization efforts underway around the world. Japan is hoping to take delivery of the first Japanese Super Interceptor by July 2023. No matter what, the JASDF looks set to be operating much more capable F-15Js for many years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2020",Ukrainian Officer Details Russian Electronic Warfare Tactics Including Radio “Virus”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Ukranian military officer has offered new insights into the scale and scope of Russian electronic and cyber warfare capabilities , including details on GPS jamming and spoofing tactics, and how they have evolved since a conflict erupted between the two countries more than five years ago. He also said that Russia’s capacity to launch some types of attacks may be waning to a degree thanks to American and other international sanctions that have made it difficult for the Kremlin to source key components for these systems. Ukrainian Colonel Ivan Pavlenko offered this information during a presentation at the 56th Annual Association of Old Crows International Symposium and Convention in Washington, D.C., as well as on the sidelines of that event, on Oct. 29, 2019. Pavlenko is presently the Deputy Chief of Combat Support Units of the Joint Forces Headquarters of the Joint Staff Armed Forces of Ukraine, but between 2009 and 2017 he had served as the Chief of the Electronic Protection Section in the Electronic Warfare Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is well known that Russian electronic warfare capabilities have been a major factor in the fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region since the war there erupted in March 2014. A month earlier, the Kremlin had launched an operation to seize control of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, as well. Russian-backed separatists in Donbass have received extensive support from the Kremlin, including reinforcements in the form of regular Russian military units with heavy armor and artillery. Russia’s forces have also employed a variety of very capable electronic warfare systems to jam and intercept communications signals, jam and spoof GPS receivers, and tap into cellular networks and hack cell phones. A Russian R-330Zh Zhitel electronic warfare system, which is used to jam cellular satellite communications and is among the many electronic warfare platfroms Russia has deployed to Ukraine over the years.., Vitaly Kuzmin In the early years of the conflict, communications security was extremely difficult for Ukranian forces. In 2015, Pavlenko said that Russia had been able to engage in mass sabotage of Russian-made radios that Ukraine was using at the time by triggering some sort of kill switch, which he described as a “virus,” remotely. This raises questions about what sort of failsafe devices Russia may be hiding inside the military equipment is sells to partners around the world, which could allow them to disable key features remotely if those countries were to turn on them for any reason. The tactic also appears to have had the secondary benefit of forcing Ukranian forces to switch to much more vulnerable commercial radios and cellular networks, which the Russians then also relentlessly attacked . “In 2014-15, Russia effectively jammed Ukrainian Motorola radios in 137-180MHz and 400-470Mhz frequency bands,” Pavlenko explained, according to a Tweet from the event from AviationWeek ‘s Defense Editor Steve Trimble. “Russians frequently target the smartphones of Ukrainian soldiers.” This is well in line with previously available public information , which has also indicated that Russia used direction-finding systems in addition to jammers to zero in on Ukranian positions and launch artillery strikes on those locations. Pavlenko said that Ukraine’s increasing use of jamming resistant, frequency-hopping radios from U.S. company Harris and Turkish firm Aselsan had improved the situation. Not surprisingly, he was unable to offer more specific details about how those systems were fairing against Russian electronic attacks. Still, Pavlenko did hint at potential limitations for the Kremlin when fighting countries using Russian-made military equipment, as well. He said that Ukrainian forces had actually experienced very little jamming targeting their satellite communications capabilities, noting that Russia and Ukraine use the same Ka-band satellites for this purpose, according to Trimble. However, Pavlenko did not say whether or not there were any similar trends with regards to Russia’s jamming of its own GLONASS satellite navigation network, which the two countries also share to a degree. He did say that there was GLONASS jamming and spoofing, as well as similar attacks on GPS systems , capabilities that have also been well documented outside of Ukraine . Underscoring how effective these attacks have been, Pavlenko said that Ukraine had lost about 100 small unmanned aircraft due to GPS jamming and spoofing between 2015 and 2017. Russia also continues to hack into individual cellphones , with Pavlenko saying that the Russians had gotten into his phone at least twice in 2018. He also confirmed that Russia has used its ability to tap into cellular networks to send SMS text messages to Ukranian troops These are tactics that the Kremlin has also reportedly used against NATO countries, including the United States , and allows Russia’s intelligence services to both scrape potentially useful personal information and possibly insert disinformation onto these devices. The texts can also be psychological warfare tools , with past reports that some were purely insulting or threatening. Using hacked personal information, those threats could include very distressing ones directed at family members or significant others. The Ukranian officer also offered details about how Russian electronic warfare tactics appear to be evolving. For instance, Russian forces in Ukraine have been using small unmanned aircraft with electro-optical cameras and electronic direction finders to specifically locate and then jam counter-battery radars ahead of mortar and other artillery strikes. Variant’s of Russia’s Orlan-10 drones , which have been employed in Ukraine, reportedly have these capabilities . Counter-battery radars, such as the AN/TPQ-36 Firefinders that Ukraine has received from the United States or the country’s own new 1L220UK , the latter of which is seen in the video below, are designed to detect and track incoming artillery rounds, providing valuable early warning so troops can try to get to cover. They can also determine the full trajectory of the rounds to help friendly forces locate enemy artillery positions. So, jamming counter-battery radars immediately before an artillery attack greatly reduces an opponent’s ability to avoid the incoming shells or mortar bombs or launch a counterattack. Targeting those radars as part of the attack can also degrade an enemy’s capacity in this regard going forward. Pavlenko said that the Russians had employed a version of this tactic against Ukraine’s own jamming systems designed to bring down unmanned aircraft, too. Still, despite Russia’s extensive and capable electronic and cyber warfare systems, and the country’s clear emphasis on the value of these assets in combat, Pavlenko said that Ukrainian forces had noticed a drop in GPS spoofing and jamming in particular. This trend does not appear to be linked to anything Ukraine has done and it’s not clear how recent this shift may be. Earlier this year, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which is charged with monitoring the implementation of the so-called Minsk II agreement , which is supposed to help deescalate the conflict in Donbass, reported that there had been an increase in these types of electronic warfare attacks. An official map the Ukranian Ministry of Defense released showing reported locations of Russian electronic warfare systems in Donbass between 2016 and 2018., Ukranian Ministry of Defense The Ukranian officer suggested this reflected the withdrawal of various electronic warfare units from Donbass, but it’s not clear why this would have been the case. One possibility is that these forces are necessary to support other, more pressing Russian engagements, such as the ongoing conflict in Syria. The Kremlin recently struck a deal with Turkey under which Russian troops will take responsibility for patrolling a vast swath of northern Syrian territory along the Turkish border. Russia has announced plans for the deployment of additional forces to the country to support this mission. Russia’s electronic warfare systems have also been a major component of the country’s intervention in Syria, which is ostensibly focused on eliminating rebels and terrorists on behalf of the regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad. U.S. forces operating in Syria in the past have reportedly encountered extensive Russian electronic attacks , as well. Pavlenko said that there might be another underlying reason for this reduction in Russia’s electronic warfare capacity in Ukraine, sanctions. “They’re like a virus,” he told Military.com ‘s Oriana Pawlyk. Sanctions may have made it increasingly difficult for Russia to sustain many of the systems it has in service now, which use, at least in part, components from sources outside the country. Setting up domestic supply chains for certain parts could prove to be difficult, if not impossible in some cases, and the Russians might have to develop all-new electronic warfare systems designed from the ground up to use alternative options. Western sanctions on Russia, many of which are in place over the country’s involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, have also had a notable impact on Russia’s economy more broadly, which, in turn, appears to have had impacts on defense spending . All told, what kind of impact sanctions, combined with other operational demands, may have actually had on Russian electronic and cyber warfare systems, or will in the long run, remains to be seen. What is clear is that the Kremlin remains heavily invested in these capabilities, which continue to be major threats on battlefields in Ukraine and elsewhere.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 5, 2020",Russia Sends Ten Subs Into North Atlantic In Drill Unprecedented In Size Since Cold War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The most extensive Russian underwater exercise since the end of the Cold War is currently underway in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic. No less than 10 Russian Navy submarines are reported to be involved, eight of which are nuclear powered, according to Norwegian intelligence. The massive exercise is thought to include tests of new weapons and stressing of capabilities of individual classes of submarines involved, including long-duration, deeply submerged operations. The exercise is also likely to test U.S. and NATO forces’ ability to track Russia’s most capable boats as they push through the Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom Gap, better known as the GIUK Gap—a major strategic bottleneck that is closely monitored. If Russian submarines can break through undetected, they have a far better chance of disappearing into the Atlantic to go about their potentially very deadly business without being traced. During a time of war, this can include wreaking havoc on Allied shipping and naval flotillas and executing pinpoint attacks on key land targets. Norwegian news outlet NRK , which originally broke the story, states that Norwegian intelligence thinks it has a decent idea of where at least some of the submarines currently are, but this could change as the exercise could last as long as two months. The Barents Observer has the areas listed: Two nuclear submarines are west of the Bear Island, between Svalbard and Finnmark, the northernmost part of mainland Norway. Two submarines are south and east of the Bear Island, guarding the entrance to the eastern part of the Barents Sea. Two Sierra class nuclear submarines are training in the northern part of the Norwegian Sea. The Sierra II class is among Russia’s most capable fast attack submarines, with their titanium hulls capable of withstanding greater depths than their steel counterparts. They are known to be extremely quiet, as well. Sierra II class SSN., Unknown source via HIsutton.com Also noted by NRK are the assumed goals of the large-scale drill (translated): “The goal for some of the submarines is to get as far out into the Atlantic as possible without being discovered. The entire voyage from the Northern Fleet bases in the Murmansk region has been submerged… Russia’s goal is to show that they are able to threaten the US East Coast… Russia wants to say that “this is our sea”, we can do this. We are able to reach the United States… They want to test the West’s ability to detect and handle this…” GIUK Gap map from the Cold War. , CIA.gov Russian submarines could also flood into the GIUK Gap and the waters off Norway in a defensive posture to keep American submarines and surface combatants from pushing northward during a crisis. This would protect strategic Russian naval ports on the Barents Sea, Russia’s ballistic missile boats patrolling the northernmost latitudes and hiding under the polar icecap, and its increasingly strategic territorial holdings in the Arctic. After decades of atrophy, the U.S. and its allies are slowly rebuilding their anti-submarine warfare capabilities in and around the GIUK Gap. Most notably, the US Navy has bolstered its detachment of P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft that operate out of Iceland. The US Navy has also reactivated the 2nd Fleet and has greatly increased patrols and exercises in the North Atlantic. Still, if a number of Russian submarines, including some of the country’s most elusive types, push south suddenly during the exercise, the U.S. and its allies may be very hard-pressed to keep track of all of them. This all comes at a time when America’s own submarine force is overtasked, as well . No matter how powerful a high-end nuclear fast attack submarine is, it can only be in one place at one time, and that place is the pier more often than not. Other U.S. and Allied naval assets with anti-submarine capabilities aren’t exactly in great supply either . There is some good news in terms of extra help with keeping tabs on submarines in the North Atlantic coming in the not so distant future. The United Kingdom received the first of nine Poseidon MRA Mk1 (P-8A) Poseidons today. Once the fleet of aircraft is fully operational, it will plug a long-standing gap in the UK’s maritime patrol capability and could help greatly in monitoring and hunting for Russian submarines pushing south through the GIUK Gap.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 25, 2019",Behold The Hero Combat Dog That Ran Down ISIS Leader Al Baghdadi,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The military’s working dogs are absolutely amazing. They are true heroes that fight right alongside their human teammates in literally the most dangerous scenarios one can imagine. They have a long and downright impressive history that is increasingly being appreciated . Case in point, Saturday’s raid to capture or kill one of the most despicable human beings in modern history, the leader of ISIS and the mastermind of its heinous caliphate, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. You can read our complete in-depth coverage on the raid here , but we are elated that the brave combat K9 that was brought on that mission and supposedly injured after chasing scumbag al-Baghdadi down a dead-end tunnel where he killed himself by detonating a suicide vest is going to survive. And yes, we now have a picture of him! President Trump released a photo of the dog on Twitter on Monday, stating “We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!” Trump made the following statements about the dog during his press conferences on Sunday morning: Yeah. We thought, for three days, this is what was going to happen. It was actually — look, nobody was even hurt. Our K-9, as they call — I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog — was injured and brought back. But we had no soldier injured. And they did a lot of shooting, and they did a lot of blasting, even not going through the front door. You know, you would think you go through the door. If you’re a normal person, you say, “Knock, knock.  May I come in?” The fact is that they blasted their way into the house and a very heavy wall, and it took them literally seconds.  By the time those things went off, they had a beautiful, big hole, and they ran in and they got everybody by surprise. … Our dog was hurt. Actually, the K-9 was hurt, went into the tunnel. But we lost nobody. … Then they went in, they blasted their way in — you’ve heard. They blasted their way in so quickly. It was incredible. Because this building was quite powerful, strong. They blasted their way in, and then all hell broke loose. It’s incredible that nobody was killed — or hurt. We had nobody even hurt. And that’s why the dog was so great. We actually had a robot to go in the tunnel, but we didn’t get it because we were tracking him very closely. But we had a robot, just in case. Because we were afraid he had a suicide vest on, and if you get close to him and he blows it up, you’re going to die. You’re going to die. He had a very powerful suicide vest. US Army On Sunday, I called for the dog to be formally recognized and maybe even work as a mascot for all the dedicated special operators and intelligence people who made the raid possible, but cannot accept credit for it publicly. This is a great first step. And what a good looking pooch it is! You couldn’t ask for a more handsome dog from Hollywood animal actor casting. Some sources state that his name is Conan and he is supposedly a Belgian Malinois: The special operations community’s combat dogs jump out of airplanes, run into firefights, chase down terrorists, detect explosives devices, and even carry critical gear into the fight. They have become increasingly visible within the community. One was also famously brought along on the Bin Laden operation. You are probably asking what can you can do to support these furry four-legged warriors. The answer to that doing just that is all too simple, donate right now to a military working dog foundation, such as Warrior Dog Foundation or Mission K9 , which see that these amazing animals have a great life once they are retired from active service. It doesn’t have to be a lot, just $5, $10, or $20 dollars can make a difference. Let’s hope we will hear more about this amazing dog in the days and weeks to come.
