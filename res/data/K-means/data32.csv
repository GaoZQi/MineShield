By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has refuted claims that its personnel “surrendered” or demanded a “reset” after squaring off against U.K. Royal Marines in a recent exercise in the United States. Multiple newspapers in the United Kingdom had earlier run stories about how British forces had “dominated” the Americans in the drill, but those reports downplayed or even entirely left out important context about exactly what had happened. The exercise in question was the latest iteration of one nicknamed Green Dagger, which the Marine Corps runs in the Mojave Desert from its base at Twentynine Palms in California. Green Dagger is a multinational event, and contingents from Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates also participated in the drill, which lasted for five days between the end of September and the beginning of October. This particular Green Dagger exercise was a lead-in to a larger training event known as Marine Air Ground Task Force Warfighting Exercise 1-22 later in October, which involved the same U.S. and foreign units. Per The Telegraph and other British outlets , Royal Marines reportedly proved so superior to U.S. Marines in the exercise that the latter surrendered halfway through, and their simulated losses were reset to allow them to continue fighting. By the end of the drill, the British contingent was in control of 65 percent of the exercise area, 45 percent more terrain than had been under its control at the start. This is hardly the first time media outlets in the United Kingdom have courted this kind of controversy in their framing of the performance of British forces in multinational exercises. “During this exercise, a U.S. Marine Regiment augmented with subordinate units formed an adversary force to actively challenge and test a peer regiment of U.S. Marines,” the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) at Twentynine Palms told The War Zone in a statement. “This training opportunity increased warfighting readiness and interoperability of the U.S. Marine Corps with multinational forces.” This is the particularly important immediate context that many of the initial media reports at best glossed over. The Royal Marines were attached to a larger force that included elements of the U.S. Marine Corps itself, as well as Canadian, Dutch, and Emirati troops. The British contingent reportedly worked directly alongside personnel from the Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) and the UAE’s Presidential Guard, a specialized force modeled after the U.S. Marines , among other elements, for this exercise. “This training opportunity increased warfighting readiness and interoperability of the U.S. Marine Corps with multinational forces. Exercise scenarios are adjusted as needed to assist commanders in meeting training objectives,” the statement from the MCAGCC continued. “‘Winners’ are never determined. This exercise does not provide an opportunity to ‘surrender,’ ‘keep score,’ or ‘reset.’ The objective of the exercise is to heighten unit performance and increase readiness.” Statements directly from the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy regarding the exercise were certainly triumphant but were also much more nuanced and grave credit to allied and partner forces for their victories during the exercise. “Victorious! @RoyalMarines triumph in part of multinational team on Exercise Green Dagger 21,” a post from 40 Commando, Royal Marines’ official Twitter account read. 40 Commando formed the core of the British force in the drill. After the initial British media stories emerged, members of the U.S. military and veterans were quick to take to social media themselves to point out the discrepancies in the framing of those reports. Many of them further pointed out that, even if the description of what had happened was entirely accurate, exercises are intended to evaluate units’ abilities to carry out various mission sets specifically to identify potential weak areas before they might have to put those skills to the test in a real-world contingency. What could be reasonably described as the “resetting” of units, including those playing the role of enemy troops , does happen, especially if one side succeeds in gaining the upper hand for any number of reasons. This ensures that the drills can continue and meet the desired training objectives. Exercises impose real and artificial limits on how and when forces can engage each other and what tactics and weapons they can employ. All of this appears to have impacted what really happened recently at Green Dagger. “The US and allied unit successfully isolated and destroyed the US pure force,” George Hasseltine, CSO at investment company Xenon Partners and a Marine veteran, wrote on Twitter based on what he said he had learned from contacts at Twentynine Palms. “Seems a waste to stop so they regenerated and kept fighting over the scheduled days of the exercise.” How decisions to reboot or otherwise restructure an exercise while it’s in progress are made can definitely be controversial if the intent looks to be to mask failures , but there’s no indication that the Marines won’t be learning valuable lessons from this experience. “The exercise was conducted in a free-play environment designed to stress commanders, derive learning points and allow participants to improve their ability to conduct offensive and defensive operations, and adapt to changes on the battlefield,” MCAGCC said in its statement. Beyond that, exercises like Green Dagger offer an environment to explore how certain tactics, techniques, and procedures, including all new concepts of operation, might hold up in an actual conflict. The Royal Marines who came to Twentynine Palms brought with them an entirely new method of doing things, known as the Littoral Response Group (LRG) concept , which their service is in the process of refining. Being presented with new ideas, and challenges, can only be valuable for all of the participants in any exercise. “Our success has proved the new commando force concept is more lethal and sophisticated than ever before and I am immensely proud of every member of the LRG and their vital contributions,” British Lt. Col. Andy Dow, head of 40 Commando, said in a statement . “Operating alongside our partners from the USA, Netherlands, Canada, and the UAE gives us a fantastic opportunity to test, integrate and continue to push our capabilities in new and innovative directions.” “Throughout this deployment, our focus has been on integrating game-changing capabilities from across the commando force to deliver disproportional effect in the face of a free-thinking peer adversary,” he added. By all accounts, what really happened at Twentynine Palms during Green Dagger 21 seems to have been that a British force performed very well, but as part of a group that included American and other allied and partner troops, and the lessons learned will be valuable all around.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 11, 2021",Israel Begins Testing Giant Radar Blimp For Spotting Low-Flying Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel has launched a new early-warning aerostat , a type of unmanned tethered airship, described as one of the largest of its kind in the world. Developed by Israeli industry with U.S. assistance, the High Availability Aerostat System, or HAAS, will be expected to provide advance warning of low-flying threats, such as cruise missiles , weaponized drones , and other aerial threats. The general concept is well established in Israel, where the successful deployment of surveillance balloons of this kind to track low-flying threats, in particular, is in stark contrast to the U.S. Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, or JLENS , a multibillion-dollar program that was ignominiously canceled in 2017. In a tweet yesterday, the Israeli Air Force (IAF), which will be responsible for operating HAAS, announced the introduction of the high-altitude aerostat after several years of development. Stationed at an unnamed location in northern Israel, the platform will be used “to detect and warn of advanced threats,” with its primary sensor being the long-range Sky Dew elevated radar. At this stage, the HAAS is still under test, with the milestone yesterday referring to the initial inflation of the aerostat’s gas envelope after installation of the radar equipment. While we are awaiting details of the specifications of the aerostat, its immense size is immediately clear by comparison to the cranes and other vehicles seen in the video below: “The Sky Dew system will be a significant component in strengthening the protection of the country’s borders in the face of a variety of threats and will contribute to the capabilities of building a more accurate and broader picture of the airspace,” said Maj. Gen. Amikam Nurkin, commander of the IAF. The IAF confirmed that the HAAS was developed by the Elta division of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in cooperation with the IAF, the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO), and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The balloon itself was produced by the American TCOM company, a specialist in this field that also produced the aerostat for JLENS. A general view of the High Availability Aerostat System, or HAAS, gives an idea as to its immense size., IAI “In several flight test campaigns conducted in recent months, we have demonstrated the outstanding capabilities of Israel’s multi-tier missile defense — including against cruise missiles,” explained Moshe Patel, director of the IMDO. “The IMDO and MDA, together with the IAF and defense industries are constantly improving Israel’s threat-detection capabilities.” While smaller sensor-equipped aerostats are a familiar feature of military operations around the world, typically providing localized surveillance for forward bases in conflict zones , for border areas, or other points of interest, large-size balloons with radar payloads are far less common. But they offer significant advantages, including their persistence — being able to remain on station for many days at a time. By avoiding ground clutter and topography, they are also able to surveil a wider portion of airspace, all the way from ground level up to high altitude, meaning they are especially useful for detecting low-flying threats. At the same time, their upper-altitude limits far outstretch those of ground-based radars, providing a far longer line-of-sight to the horizon. The idea of using an aerostat to provide warning of incoming cruise missile attacks also underpinned the U.S. Army’s JLENS program, which ran between 1996 and 2017 but failed to provide an operational capability before being canceled amid delays and cost overruns. Prototypes of JLENS were fitted with either a VHF-band surveillance radar or an X-band fire control radar. Though JLENS failed, including an embarrassing and widely publicized incident in which the aerostat broke free of its moorings in Aberdeen, Maryland, before floating across Pennsylvania, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) does operate a network of smaller Tethered Aerostat Radar Systems (TARS) along portions of America’s southern borders. Other countries have introduced similar aerostat-based long-range surveillance systems, including China, which has deployed aerostats that may carry radars above its man-made islands in the South China Sea . Annotated satellite imagery showing a tethered aerostat above a Chinese man-made island in the South China Sea in November 2019., IMAGESAT INTERNATIONAL Israel itself has sold tethered aerostats with radars to other countries, including IAI’s ELM-2083 with its L-band active electronically scanned array (AESA). The manufacturer claims it is able to track up to 500 targets, with a detection range of more than 135 nautical miles against a fighter-sized target and coverage from the ground up to 24,000 feet. Customers for the ELM-2083 include India and Singapore, the latter at least using it in conjunction with a TCOM-designed balloon. For the IAF, providing persistent, multi-directional airspace surveillance from its high-altitude perch, the HAAS will be able to detect different threats at long range, and at low level, with targeting data then fed into Israel’s multi-layered air defense architecture , essentially complementing any existing sensors within the ground-based surveillance network, as well as airborne sensors mounted on planes and drones. In addition to manned fighter jets , the cutting edge of the Israeli air-defense system includes missile systems ranging from the Arrow 3 ballistic-missile defense system down to the Iron Dome that can counter rockets , artillery shells, and mortar rounds, and which is increasingly also expected to tackle more sophisticated threats. All these systems and more would potentially benefit from the additional surveillance capacity offered by an aerostat-based radar, especially against the kinds of low-flying threats that might leak through traditional radar coverage. Official Israeli Ministry of Defense video of the Iron Dome air defense system in action: Israel is keenly aware of the potential of cruise missile attacks from regional adversaries, chief of which is Iran, as well as potentially non-state actors. Israel’s most immediate adversaries, especially the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah, have made significant strides in recent years in expanding and improving their own rocket and missile arsenals, which presents new challenges for the country’s entire multi-tier missile-defense architecture. But there is a growing risk that those groups, and others in the region, are fielding new systems, among them suicide drones and cruise missiles, which Iron Dome may not be best equipped to respond to in its present form. That realization has driven efforts to expand the target sets for the Iron Dome and perhaps also the development of HAAS. It’s notable that the Iron Dome has already demonstrated a burgeoning ability to engage cruise missiles and small drones, as well as low-flying aircraft. The U.S. Army has recently acquired the Iron Dome with a view to using it to provide localized defense against incoming cruise missiles on the island of Guam , recognizing one of the most prominent threats outlined in the Pentagon’s last Missile Defense Review . As well as their specific application in defense against cruise missile attacks, radar-toting aerostats like the HAAS contribute more generally to improved situational awareness. For a relatively small country like Israel, faced by a wide variety of different threats and surrounded by potential flashpoints, advanced warning of this kind is always going to be in demand. The HAAS could also help counter the more familiar kinds of threats posed by the Hamas militant group in Gaza, as well as the Hezbollah group in Lebanon. These are armed with significant arsenals of rockets that are capable of hitting major cities in Israel. During the Gaza conflict earlier this year, barrages of rockets were fired in an effort to overwhelm Israeli air defenses. The Iron Dome system saw extensive use during the 11-day conflict, and The War Zone discussed its performance in depth at the time . In addition, these militant groups are making increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles including suicide drones carrying explosive payloads. A Hamas militant prepares a Shehab suicide drone for launch against Israel from the Gaza Strip., Hamas However, placing the HAAS in northern Israel suggests that the main concern may be threats approaching from Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Lebanon, rather than from Gaza. In Lebanon in particular, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group has an enormous and sophisticated arsenal of missiles and drones, with the range to reach Israel. It’s also notable that Israel has placed blame on Iran more directly in the last year in relation to longer-range attempted drone strikes and the threat posed by drone strikes launched by Iranian proxies in Iraq or Syria has been increasingly discussed . At the same time, the mountainous terrain of the north of the country would generally appear better suited to an elevated top-down-looking radar such as Sky Dew. A primary mission of JLENS was to protect Washington, D.C., from cruise missile attack, which remains a major concern . It’s also worth bearing in mind that, while we don’t know the detailed capabilities of HAAS, JLENS was billed as being able to monitor the airspace from Virginia to New York or Boston, along a front that was some 500 miles long. Israel’s territory doesn’t stretch more than 500 miles at its longest point, so locating it in northern Israel could well provide coverage in other directions. The ability to remain aloft for extended periods, normally in different types of weather, means that surveillance aerostats like HAAS can offer cost-effectiveness and reduced maintenance demands, especially compared with airborne early-warning aircraft . On the other hand, we don’t know how much has been invested in the Israeli program so far and, as JLENS demonstrates, this can be a highly expensive capability to realize. There have been reports suggesting that development was paid for “almost entirely” by the U.S. government, via Foreign Military Financing. Nevertheless, Israel seems convinced that large-size aerostats offer an important adjunct to its already powerful air-defense network. As the HAAS heads toward operational service, it will be interesting to see whether other countries adopt similar solutions as they seek to counter similar low-flying threats.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2021",China’s New Ballistic Missile Subs Could Strike The U.S. Without Sailing Into The Pacific,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. By now, it’s no secret that the Chinese government is in the midst of a significant expansion of its strategic nuclear arsenal. This includes the unexpected construction of hundreds of new silos for intercontinental ballistic missiles and the more novel development of a fractional orbital bombardment system that utilizes a hypersonic glide vehicle . A new Pentagon report has highlighted progress on a much more expected, but nevertheless significant capability. This is the development and fielding of longer-range submarine-launched ballistic missiles that could be fired from less vulnerable “bastions” closer to the mainland, maybe even while in port. The Pentagon released the unclassified version of its annual report to Congress on Chinese military and security developments earlier today. The review, which is just over 190 pages long, covers a wide variety of developments that are not strictly limited to nuclear deterrence. This includes a first-ever mention of the Chinese development of a next-generation “tactical bomber,” along with the H-20 advanced strategic bomber , bringing it in line with a public Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report from 2019 . China continues to build large numbers of other combat aircraft , as well as ships and ground-based weapon systems, as it expands and modernizes its conventional forces. A truck carries a JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile during a parade in Beijing in 2019., AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein Still, significant space is devoted to China’s nuclear weapons programs, including the aforementioned silos and the potential for the country to have 700 warheads by 2027 and 300 more by 2030. That assessment is an increase from the one the Pentagon included in its China report last year , which said the officials in Beijing might be aiming for 400 warheads in the coming years. All of this is a significant increase over the estimated size of the current Chinese stockpile, which remains “in the low-200s,” according to the Pentagon. There is no mention of China’s in-development fractional orbital bombardment system that was reportedly tested twice earlier this year , with the glider completing a full orbit before coming back down to Earth in at least one of these experiments. This makes some sense given that “this report covers security and military developments involving the PRC until the end of 2020,” according to the document’s preface. The report includes some new details about China’s submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) and its nuclear ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) fleets, as well as how the Pentagon expects the Chinese to field those capabilities in the future. At present, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has six Type 094 SSBNs, also known as the Jin class, each of which carry up to 12 JL-2 SLBMs . A new Type 096 SSBN is now in development, as is a new JL-3 SLBM . The Pentagon had already publicly assessed last year that the PLAN’s existing SSBN fleet armed with JL-2 represented “the country’s first viable sea-based nuclear deterrent.” “Type 096 SSBN reportedly will be armed with a follow-on SLBM, and it will likely begin construction in the early- 2020s,” according to the Pentagon’s latest China report. “Based on the 40-plus-year service life of the PRCs first generation SSNs [nuclear attack submarines], the PRC will operate its Jin and Type 096 SSBN fleets concurrently.” “The current range limitations of the JL-2 will require the Jin to operate in areas north and east of Hawaii if the PRC seeks to target the east coast of the United States,” it continues. The exact maximum range of the JL-2 is unknown, but publicly available estimates put it at between 8,000 and 9,000 kilometers , or between 4,970 and 5,592 miles. The PLAN’s Yulin Naval Base , where the bulk of the Type 094s are based, is some 5,000 miles from Alaska, nearly 6,000 miles away from the Hawaiian islands, and more than 7,000 miles from the West Coast of the contiguous United States. A satellite image showing two Type 094 SSBNs, along with another type of submarine at the northernmost visible pier, docked at China’s Yulin Naval Base in March 2020., Google Earth “As the PRC fields newer, more capable, and longer ranged SLBMs such as the JL-3, the PLAN will gain the ability to target the continental United States from littoral waters, and thus may consider bastion operations to enhance the survivability of its sea-based deterrent,” the Pentagon’s latest China report adds “The South China Sea and Bohai Gulf are probably the PRC’s preferred options for employing this concept.” This may seem like a simple and obvious thing, but SSBNs inherently represent a highly flexible and survivable nuclear deterrent capability, especially for use in a second-strike role to ensure an ability to retaliate after an initial enemy onslaught. Those attributes are only increased if the future JL-3, which could have a range of up to 7,500 miles , enables launches against the United States from China’s own littoral areas, or even Chinese ports. The latter tactic is something the Soviet Union demonstrated during the Cold War and is something the Russian Navy reportedly still trains to do today. “Bastions” where the PLA could work to keep opponents out, at least for a time, using its extensive array of anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) assets, would present additional challenges. While the South China Sea remains contested , despite Beijing’s efforts to declare the entire region as its sovereign territory , the Bohai Gulf, also known as the Bohai Sea, is shielded on three sides by the Chinese mainland. The first reported test of the JL-3 took place in the Bohai Sea in 2018. A map showing the general locations of the Bohai Sea, to the north, and the South China Sea, to the south. The Pentagon has identified these bodies of water as potential “bastions” where future Chinese SSBNs armed with longer-range SLBMs could operate under a greater protective umbrella, while still being able to hold targets in the United States at risk., Google Maps It can take even the fastest nuclear submarines days to cross the Pacific. So, a Type 094 or Type 096 being able to launch from much closer to the Chinese mainland significantly shortens the total time necessary between the decision to launch, or even just get into position to do so, and a missile potentially leaving their launch tubes. Similarly, being able to carry out those launches from denied areas that an opponent has a limited ability to monitor further limits available early warning options while providing additional protection for friendly SSBNs. Keeping SSBNs closer to home could help ease command and control requirements and otherwise simplify operational and logistical demands for the PLAN, which still has limited experience conducting nuclear deterrent patrols. It’s unclear when China might reach an operational capability with the JL-3 together with the new Type 096. Past reports have said Type 096s armed with JL-3s could be in service as early as 2025. The PLAN might also be looking to integrate the missiles onto its older Type 094s . Of course, Chinese SSBNs, regardless of their capabilities, will also continue to be just one part of an increasingly robust and diverse Chinese nuclear arsenal. “The PRC has possibly already established a nascent ‘nuclear triad’ with the development of a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) and improvement of its ground and sea-based nuclear capabilities,” the Pentagon’s new China report says. At the same time, while other Chinese nuclear developments have garnered significant attention, the country is getting ever closer to a more capable and survivable second-strike deterrent in the form of its SSBNs able to conduct launches from the safety of waters closer to home.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2021",Video Shows U.S. Destroyer’s Very Intimate Standoff With Iranian Vessels Over Seized Oil Tanker (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has released dramatic video footage of an incident in the Gulf of Oman, which reportedly took place last week. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized the Vietnam-flagged tanker ship Sothys and then appears to have sent small boats to swarm two U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers , as well as U.S. Coast Guard cutters , in what by every indication is an unprecedented altercation. From what we can see in the footage, members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) swarmed the Sothys using small boats, including the unusual catamaran vessel Shahid Nazeri , and also landed a boarding party on the tanker’s deck using a Bell 412 helicopter . The IRGC has used similar tactics when seizing other commercial tankers in the past. Other clips indicate that the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS The Sullivans (DDG-68) and USS Michael P. Murphy (DDG-112), which are both known to be operating in the region , arrived on the scene. At least one U.S. Coast Guard Sentinel class Fast Response Cutter is also seen in the footage. The Coast Guard sent two of these vessels , the USCGC Charles Moulthrope and USCGC Robert Goldman , to the Middle East earlier this year. At least one MH-60R Seahawk helicopter is seen in the footage, which would have been launched from either The Sullivans or Michael P. Murphy . The helicopter appears to be carrying two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. What is then seen in the video clips are a series of very close interactions between at least The Sullivans , which came up alongside the Sothys , and Iranian boats. IRGC personnel are seen pointing deck-mounted machine guns at the American ship, though there is no indication any shots were fired. There are various overhead views of the entire event, which would have been filmed by Iranian manned aircraft or drones , showing the numerous ships and small boats all in very close proximity around the tanker. capture via Fars News capture via Fars News While we don’t know exactly how close U.S. and Iranian vessels came to each other, it is clear that some of the distances involved were extremely short. At one point in the footage, as seen below, IRGC boats cut right in front of the bow of The Sullivans . These kinds of interactions can be highly dangerous for all parties involved because of the risks of collisions. Larger ships, such as an Arleigh Burke class destroyer —which is more than 500 feet in length and displaces more than 8,000 tons — may not even necessarily see a smaller vessel and could have trouble stopping or otherwise maneuvering out of the way in these kinds of situations. capture via Fars News A collision in a scenario like this could then prompt further escalation. There were a number of instances earlier this year in the Persian Gulf where U.S. naval forces actually fired warning shots at IRGC vessels that were operating in unsafe and unprofessional ways nearby. The Sullivans would also have been very vulnerable in this situation to other kinds of attacks. For instance, if one of these small boats had been laden with explosives , it could have done significant damage to the ship. The details about exactly what prompted this particular episode are still murky. Iranian state media outlets first disclosed the incident earlier today but provided only limited details about what had happened. A subsequent report from Newsweek , citing a U.S. official, said that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ seizure of the Sothys occurred last week, but it remains unclear exactly when these events took place. Satellite imagery indicates that Sothys is now anchored near Iran’s Qeshm Island in the Strait of Hormuz, which links the Gulf of Oman to the Persian Gulf. A U.S. Air Force RC-135W Rivet Joint and a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II , both of which are intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, were spotted flying today over the Gulf of Oman in the general vicinity of where the incident is likely to have occurred. However, American ISR flights in the region are commonplace , and it is unclear whether this activity is directly linked to this recent tanker seizure. Iran claims that the IRGC’s actions were prompted by attempts by the U.S. government to “steal” Iranian oil onboard the ship and that they blocked an attempt to recapture the Sothys . Iranian authorities further asserted that American forces had previously detained a different tanker carrying Iranian oil and then transferred it at sea to the Sothys . The United States has publicly announced the seizure of vessels carrying Iranian oil in violation of American sanctions before. There is satellite imagery that shows Sothys alongside the Oman Pride , a sanctioned tanker, off Oman in June, which could point to a ship-to-ship transfer, as well. However, “we’re refuting the Iranian claims that they prevented us from taking back this vessel,” the unnamed American official told Newsweek . “Here’s the bottom line. This occurred last week. U.S. naval forces in the Gulf of Oman observed Iranian naval forces seize this oil tanker.” When reached for comment, the U.S. Navy’s Office of the Chief of Information redirected The War Zone to U.S. Central Command. CENTCOM subsequently said it had no statement to offer about the reported incident at present. U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) similarly declined to comment, but said it was aware of the various media reports, according to The Guardian in the United Kingdom. There are separate unconfirmed reports that the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Essex was harassed by Iranian drones during a transit of the Strait of Hormuz in the past day or so. The War Zone has reached out to NAVCENT for more information about that reported incident. It is important to note that the veracity of the video clips, seen below via Iran’s semi-official Fars News , now circulating online cannot be readily verified independently. There is the possibility that portions of the footage may not necessarily all be from this recent reported incident or may have been otherwise altered in some way. If the footage the Iranians released is an accurate depiction of the reported events last week, even in part, it certainly reflects yet another serious high-seas encounter between the two countries. It certainly underscores the risks inherent in the U.S. government’s efforts to enforce crippling sanctions on the regime in Tehran. Sanctions relief continues to be a major sticking point in indirect negotiations between Washington and Tehran regarding the U.S. government’s potential return to a controversial multinational deal over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. In the meantime, now that Iran has released all of this video footage to support its version of events, it seems likely that the U.S. government will at have to respond more directly to those claims. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Updated 10:25 PM EST: Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby responded to questions regarding this incident, which he said took place on Oct. 24, at a press conference earlier today. Kirby insisted that American forces on the scene were simply monitoring the situation, rather than attempting to intervene, and refuted Iran’s claim that the oil Sothys was carrying had been seized earlier by the United States. He declined to confirm the identity of the tanker at the center of the incident himself or explain why the U.S. military had not previously disclosed that this altercation had occurred. The full exchange between him and members of the Pentagon press pool on this matter is as follows: Q: Hello John, the Iranians have said that U.S. tried to seize some Iranian oil. And they prevented it and I wanted to have your side of the story to explain me what happens? MR. KIRBY: I’ve seen the Iranian claims they are absolutely totally false and untrue. There was no such effort by U.S. naval assets to seize anything. What this refers to is back on the 24th of October, U.S. Navy assets did monitor Iranian forces, illegally boarding and seizing a merchant vessel in international waters in the Gulf of Oman. United States Fifth Fleet directed two ships and aerial assets to closely monitor that situation at no time were U.S. forces attempting to retake or otherwise engage in the situation’s — we acted completely in accordance with the law. So, it’s a bogus claim. Q: OK. They said that, actually, there were two tankers, that the U.S. seized the oil from the first tanker and put it in second tanker. You don’t confirm that? MR. KIRBY: I not only don’t confirm it. It’s a ridiculous claim. It’s absolutely not true. And I would add that Iran’s actions, the ones that are true of them, illegally boarding and seizing a merchant vessel constitute a blatant violation of international law. That undermines freedom of navigation in the free flow of commerce. Q: Do you know, that… MR. KIRBY: The only seizing that was done was by Iran. Q: Do you know the nationality of the tanker they seized? MR. KIRBY: I do, but I’m not at liberty to say that. I think we would refer to that individual nation to speak to that. Q: On this topic. MR. KIRBY: Yes. Q: So, based on the video from the Iranian side, and what you just stated. There were U.S. Navy assets and airplanes? MR. KIRBY: And I said that, they were monitoring. Q: My question is about the monitoring part. I mean, you have NAVCENT, and you have the IMSCC. Combined together their mission is basically to maritime — to ensure maritime stability security of the sea lines of communication, deter state sponsored malign activity, reassure the merchant shipping in that region. I mean, evidently the U.S. didn’t do any of that. I mean, where’s the assurance? And where’s the deterrent effect of your presence? MR. KIRBY: What I can tell you is we acted in accordance with international law, unlike the Iranians, and I’ll leave it at that. Q: There was an intentional effort not to escalate the situation? MR. KIRBY: We acted in accordance with international law, unlike the Iranians. And we do believe our forward presence in that part of the world has and will continue to act as a deterrent. Does it deter every action by the Iranians and the particularly the IRGC maybe? No, that’s one of the reasons why we’re there to help as I said, support freedom of navigation and free commerce. That’s one of the reasons why we have a naval presence there. As well as many of our allies and partners. But we acted in accordance with international law. And I think your question would also be well put to the folks in Tehran. Q: Our correspondent is in Tehran, my follow up on this is what did the (unintelligible) wait until today, to come out with its version of what happened? MR. KIRBY: There was no waiting Fahdi. We were monitoring, we monitor a lot of activity in that part of the world. It’s not about waiting. We are reacting to false claims that the Iranians made today. So, if you’re asking me, why am I talking about this today, because you’re asking me about it today. Because the Iranians lied about it today. But we monitor maritime traffic every day out there, and not all of it rises to the level of us putting out a press release or talking about it overtly from the podium. Patty. Q: If you looked at the video, those small ships, small boats were really close to that destroyer. As you know, and we know, after the Cole, that was a huge concern. Did the captain, that the crew do anything to try and sort of swat away the small boats. Were they allowed to do anything? Or were you — just to order to avoid escalation? MR. KIRBY: I don’t know. I mean, I wasn’t there, Patty. So, I’m not going to speak for the commanding officer of the destroyer. And what force protection measures they might have taken. What I can tell you is that the commanding officers of our ships always have the right to self-defense. And multiple ways to defend their ship, and their crew. And they know they had those authorities. They know, they had those capabilities. Now, what actually transpired aboard that particular destroyer, I wouldn’t get into. I’d refer you to the Navy or to the central command to talk about that in more detail. Yes. Q: Was there any possibility that the ship was engaged in piracy of any sort or illicit oil transfers or anything like that? MR. KIRBY: I don’t have any additional information about the ship that the Iranians illegally boarded and seized? And again, I just don’t have more. Q: Why were we tracking? MR. KIRBY: Why were we tracking? Q: Yes, why were we tracking? MR. KIRBY: We monitor a lot of traffic in that part of the world? Yes, Abraham.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 11, 2021",Rare Pod Simulated AIM-120 Missile Engagements During Massive War Game,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has employed a little-known testing pod associated with the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile , or AMRAAM, during a recent large-force exercise. Images of an F-16C fighter jet carrying the AMRAAM Captive Equipment, or ACE, pod appeared after the latest Test Flag Enterprise , or TFE, which fuses together geographically separated drills using datalink networks. This relates to the Pentagon’s emerging Joint All-Domain Command and Control architecture, or JADC2, which aims to connect sensors from all U.S. military services into a single network . The images showing the ACE pod were published by the Air Force together with details of the TFE, in which, for the first time, the Air Force combined three major exercises run in different locations, in real-time. The F-16 carrying the pod was seen at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on October 26 and was one of those assigned to the resident 96th Test Wing. A 96th Test Wing F-16C taxies prior to an Emerald Flag mission at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on October 26. An ACE pod is carried on the center hardpoint under the port wing., U.S. Air Force/1st Lt. Karissa Rodriguez As for the pod, this essentially provides the aircraft carrying it with all the functions of the real missile, being interfaced with the jet in such a way that it’s treated as a live round, while the pod contains all the support equipment needed to monitor a simulated launch, including a datalink. Unlike a real AMRAAM, of course, the ACE pod’s combination of actual missile components and environmental conditioning equipment allows the pilot to simulate multiple launches — a significant benefit in a target-rich large-force exercise , or when various different launch parameters need to be assessed. Importantly, the pod’s missile seeker also goes active (as it would for the terminal phase of the engagement), to demonstrate all performance parameters of the seeker. This is critical data to not only certify the capabilities of the missile, but to improve and upgrade it so that it performs better against countermeasures and under unique employment circumstances. Basic AMRAAM modes. With upgraded versions that have full networking capability, additional flexibility has been added beyond what this graphic shows., USN In the past, at least, the ACE pod was created by putting AMRAAM missile components into an adapted drop tank. Over time, this has morphed into more purpose-built configurations. More details on how the ACE pod works are provided in a report on AMRAAM testing with the F/A-18 Hornet fighter from Naval Weapons Test Squadron Point Mugu, California, available from the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC): “After simulated launch, the ACE pod receives the datalink and, when in range of the target will activate its onboard transmitter and attempt to acquire the target. The ACE pod utilizes the same tactical software as an actual missile. All missile functions are captured and transmitted in real-time through secure telemetry channels. The post-flight analysis includes a detailed analysis of aircraft datalink, missile functioning and track file activity, and TSPI [time-space position information] comparison of actual versus system targeting information. ACE flight data is utilized post-flight to both help verify simulation validity and to improve the fidelity of the datalink database.” An ACE pod in use with the US Navy., USN What’s notable in the case of the recent TFE, which brought together Orange , Emerald, and Black Flag exercises via advanced networking, is that one of the areas of focus was long-range fighter kill chains — in other words, ensuring fighters are able to acquire and engage enemy air threats at long distances, via advanced networking. Clearly, the ACE pod would have a very useful role to play in these kinds of evaluations. Major Ryan Forystek, a 40th Flight Test Squadron pilot, prepares for an Emerald Flag sortie, at Eglin Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/1st Lt. Karissa Rodriguez A 96th Test Wing F-16C taxies prior to an Emerald Flag mission., U.S. Air Force/1st Lt. Karissa Rodriguez “Emerald Flag [EF] had very focused JADC2 objectives in 21-3 and accomplished crucial steps in completing end-to-end connectivity for long-range kill webs,” explained Captain Joe Haggberg, Emerald Flag deputy director, in a statement. “The EF team gleaned valuable information that will fundamentally transform the way we think, fight, and employ capabilities at further range. Emerald Flag is extremely resource-efficient in utilizing simulation methods that replace the need for many aircraft that is typical for a large event.” A 96th Test Wing F-16C takes off to participate in Emerald Flag at Eglin Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/1st Lt. Karissa Rodriguez While the three Flag events were held at the three geographically separated locations: the R-2508 complex in California (Orange Flag), the Nevada Test and Training Range (Black Flag), and the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range (Emerald Flag), the last of these has particular relevance for missile-related trials. Here, the Gulf Range Complex provides over 130,000 square miles of training airspace, allowing both large-scale air combat training and sustained flying at supersonic speeds, as well as live missile shots, including against target drones . You can read more here about how the Air Force uses live missiles to assess how they would function in combat situations. The first AMRAAM shot by an F-16 with the Operational Flight Program M-series 7.2+ software utilizing the new AN/APG-83 SABR radar, over the Gulf of Mexico near Eglin Air Force Base, in April 2020., U.S. Air Force In March, Eglin hosted another AMRAAM-related test, this one involving a live missile, with what it described as “the longest known air-to-air missile shot to date.” While the actual distance was not disclosed, the service said the test “laid the groundwork for modernizing range capabilities in support of future long-range weapons testing on the Eglin-Gulf Test and Training Range.” Notably, the same AMRAAM live-fire test was also described at the time as being in support of “long-range kill chain” capabilities.” A 96th Test Wing maintainer pulls chocks for an ARMAAM-armed F-16 on an Emerald Flag mission at Eglin Air Force Base. , U.S. Air Force/1st Lt. Karissa Rodriguez TFEs like this serve to test what systems and tactics work, and which don’t, and they gather an enormous amount of data to support these efforts. While the ACE pod was clearly only one aspect of what was being trialed over Florida and elsewhere, the information that these simulated AMRAAM shots will have gathered will be fed back to the operational forces to improve their lethality. The Air Force has not provided many details of exactly what kinds of engagement scenarios were being put to the test at the Emerald Flag part of this TFE. But we do know that, as far as missile engagements are concerned, there is an increasing focus on extended range, new and more capable sensors, including powerful active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and infrared search and track systems . A Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 SABR radar is installed in an Air National Guard F-16 at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland., U.S. AIR FORCE At the same time, aerial engagements are expected to involve broader collaboration with other assets under JADC2 and other similar initiatives, including using networked and third-party sensors to provide targeting data for engagements without the launching aircraft locking the target up themselves. This would seem to be inherent in the “kill chain” descriptions applied for the latest TFE as well as the very long-range AMRAAM shot. The main driver behind this demand for longer-range and more lethal air-to-air missiles is fairly obvious: the developments in beyond-visual-range weapons made in China and Russia . Both those countries have fielded, or are very close to fielding air-to-air missiles that challenge the well-establish AMRAAM in terms of performance. With that in mind, the United States is now looking beyond the AMRAAM and toward potential successors, including the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM). Then there is Boeing’s Long-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or LRAAM, a two-stage weapon that was unveiled in September . Boeing revealed a model of its Long-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or LRAAM, design at the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, in September., JOSEPH TREVITHICK In March, the Air Force confirmed it has “laid the groundwork for modernizing range capabilities in support of future long-range weapons testing on the Eglin-Gulf Test and Training Range.” While the Pentagon hopes weapons like these will restore its long-range air-to-air missile lead, work continues to improve the capabilities of the AMRAAM, which remains in large-scale service and in production for domestic and export use . Recent upgrades have included the introduction of the latest AIM-120D-3 version, introducing improved hardware in the guidance section. Exactly how the use of the ACE pod during the TFE’s Emerald Flag component was related to these ambitions is unclear. But with new missiles optimized for beyond-visual-range engagements in the works, missile test simulations of this kind are only likely to be more common in the future.

Kevin Noonan,"Updated on Feb 8, 2022",The Navy Isn’t Prepared To Face The Growing Diesel Submarine Threat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fighting a diesel submarine is potentially easy, but assuredly difficult. Don’t care for the contradiction? Too bad! Welcome to anti-submarine warfare, or ASW. The diesel! It is very interesting to see the media coverage of the diesel submarine threat and how impossible it will be to find air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines. It’s as if we have been thrown back to the dark days of early 1942, when Nazi U-boats began operating off the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. One of my favorite alarmist headlines reads : NATO Calls This Russian Submarine the “Black Hole” for 1 Terrifying Reason There is no question that searching for a diesel submarine operating on batteries is very difficult, due to the nature of its signature (or, for the most part, non-signature). I was a sensor operator (SENSO) on S-3 Vikings starting in the mid-1980s, and I spent a lot of time looking for submarines of all kinds. On board a carrier, my Viking squadron’s aircrew chief petty officer loved to remind everyone in our ready room, flashlight in hand, about the challenge we faced as we were about to go into any major submarine-hunting exercise that included diesel boats, which was an extremely rare event. Turning it on, he said: “This is what a diesel sub sounds like.” The silence produced by the device and his comment was deafening. However, the silence of a diesel submarine is not deafening. An S-3A Viking with its magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) deployed. The author hunted submarines during the Cold War as a crewman aboard Vikings. , USN/National Archives I’m amazed at how many of us forget that two world wars were successfully fought against diesel submarines. Then, as the first decade of the Cold War progressed, we relearned how to fight the diesel submarine’s technological advancements — namely, the snorkel and hydrodynamic streamlining. Notice I said “signature” above, which implies someone is trying to track a diesel submarine with passive sonobuoys . The first sonobuoys, introduced during World War II’s final years, had relatively good success into the 1950s at tracking diesel-boat propeller noises when the operator turned up successive buoys and listened for the one with the loudest propeller noise. As diesel boats became more streamlined and propeller-blade technology progressed, dropping passive buoys after a target submerged did not work as well. Basically, better boats moved faster than NATO aircraft and ASW ships could drop, tune, and listen to the buoys. Thankfully, active sonobuoy technology was just coming of age, and we were back in the game. Along with active sonobuoys, helicopter dipping-sonar technology was rising to the occasion, and a new fixed-wing/rotary-wing hunter-killer team rose with it. Operationally, no one in the mid-to-late Cold War attempted to track a submerged diesel submarine passively (where hydrophones listen without the help of any active sonar pulses). That non-use may be contributing to the fearful awe in which we hold diesel submarines today. Hunting Nukes Vs Diesels During The Cold War Tracking a nuclear submarine can be relatively easy, depending on how noisy it is. As a lot of open-source material makes clear, nuclear boats always have some form of machinery running. The U.S. Navy and its allies learned early on just how noisy such a submarine can be. There is a great story about how easily SOSUS —the vast U.S. undersea sonar tracking network—detected and tracked the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus (SSN-571), when it made its initial voyage across the Atlantic. It stunned the Navy. From then on, the service worked hard at silencing techniques that would make its boats the quietest in the world. The Soviets, on the other hand, took far too long to appreciate the need for silencing, focusing instead on perfecting their troubled reactors . A US Navy P-3 Orion over a Soviet Victor I class nuclear submarine. Hunting ‘nukes’ is something of a different artform than hunting diesel-electric submarines., USN Passive sonobuoys became the way to track nuclear submarines during the latter half of the Cold War. Once you gained contact with a search pattern of buoys, you then localized and tracked the target with an ever-decreasing number and narrowing pattern. This worked very, very well, particularly against noisy Soviet submarines. Reliance on this method, however, would become a liability by the time the Cold War came to an end. Dropping active sonobuoys on a nuclear submarine was not normal. Doing so would only be used as a last resort, either to refine an attack or as an act of desperation if the damn thing pulled a fast one and disappeared! On the other hand, using active sonobuoys against a nuclear boat could be a planned aspect of an ASW exercise, but time “on top” of a U.S. submarine was precious and rare. In my own experience working with U.S. boats—mostly of the 637/ Sturgeon class—I don’t recall ever dropping an active AN/SSQ-62 DICASS buoy on one from my S-3 Viking. It was almost unheard of to use active buoys against a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine. There’s a Cold War ASW legend that said using active was considered an act of war. I haven’t been able to find anything to support this, but it’s what we were told. I said “almost unheard of,” however. Despite the warning, sometimes permission was given, and it was a great tool to go active on a Soviet boat just to annoy the hell out of them. I never did this, but I have heard the stories of others who did. A major problem for the U.S. Navy during the Cold War was training. As the nuclear-powered navy took over, diesel submarines quickly attained pariah status, much as propeller-driven aircraft did in the wake of the jet age. After the Navy’s three Barbel class diesel submarines were decommissioned in the late 1980s — a decision solidified by the tragic fire aboard the USS Bonefish (SS-582) in the spring of 1988 — that was it; no more U.S. diesels. This myopic view affected how well-trained our ASW forces — including nuclear submarines — were when facing a diesel boat in the latter part of the Cold War. Sadly, I never got a chance to work with one of the Navy’s remarkable diesel subs. I felt completely inadequate with my training and understanding of how to hunt one using active sonobuoys. Even extensive time in the S-3 Viking Weapons Systems Trainer (WST) just did not prepare me for the realities of the active acoustic environment. I shudder every time I think about how poorly I would have done in a shooting war against a Soviet diesel boat. An aerial starboard bow view of a Soviet Golf II class diesel-powered ballistic-missile submarine underway in 1985., Department of Defense Since the end of the Cold War, the Navy has refused to seriously consider the need for a non-nuclear boat. The lack of such submarines, particularly U.S.-owned and operated ones, hinders effective training, which continues to be an embarrassment for the U.S. Navy as it confronts the rise of China, a resurgent Russia, and the continued proliferation of diesel/AIP submarines. Oddly enough, on rare occasions, U.S. nuclear submarines try to compensate for the shortfall by running their auxiliary diesel generators for ASW forces while on the surface or pretending to snorkel to simulate a diesel boat. But let’s be honest, that simply doesn’t approach the reality of going up against the genuine article . Dispelling Myths So, how much of a myth is it that diesel submarines are impossible to find and then track? The problem begins with trying to find a diesel submarine. The Atlantic Ocean’s underwater network of passive acoustic arrays — the SOund SUrveillance System, commonly known as SOSUS — was the Navy’s canary in the oceanic coal mine. It was originally designed to detect diesel submarines operating their main engines while snorkeling or surfaced. First-, second-, and even third-generation Soviet diesel boats, transiting into the Atlantic from the Soviet Northern or Baltic Fleets were relatively easy to detect. But in the Mediterranean Sea, there was no SOSUS network to rely on. Essentially, NATO air, surface, and subsurface ASW forces had to work closely together to keep constant tracks on the adversary. If contact was lost (say, because the boat submerged on electric motors), the nature of the Mediterranean’s acoustic conditions and its concentrated shipping lanes and fishing grounds all contributed to the challenges of regenerating contact. This became substantially more difficult with the arrival of Soviet Tango class diesel attack submarines. Tango class submarines entered service beginning in 1972. , USN I don’t know much about the success of low-frequency active (LFA) sonar used today. Regardless, even if you find a subsurface contact in this manner, you still have to classify it ! A returned ping from the active sonar/sonobuoy I’m familiar with says very little about the source. However, I recently learned from an unclassified U.S. Navy source that the airborne low-frequency (ALF) dipping sonar array on MH-60R Seahawks is capable of identifying a submarine down to its name, by reading its vibration signature as it moves through the water . For an old hand like me, if this is true, then this is incredibly exciting. Diesel Boats As Hunters Let me speculate on some factors that affect the hunters and the hunted. First, the hunted: Diesel submarines have always been relatively small. This affects capacity in several ways. A small submarine has a small power plant and has limited storage for batteries. While battery storage technology is far better than it was in World War II (more on that below), it remains a severe limitation on a diesel boat. There is still no such thing as an operational 30-knot diesel submarine — on primary propulsion or batteries. Running at maximum speed submerged depletes the battery at an exponentially higher rate than the far more efficient five knots or less. Commander Kaj Toft Madsen, a Dutch submarine skipper writing about the threat in an August 1996 Naval Institute Proceedings article , summarized the propulsion concerns a diesel boat commander faces: While on patrol, the commanding officer of a conventional submarine always must be thinking of the battery and the amount of energy remaining. In the patrol area, speed seldom will exceed five knots, to limit energy consumption and radiated noise. Reluctant to operate with low battery, a submarine’s CO will take any opportunity to snorkel. It is better to do many, short snorkelings than a few longer ones. Following this policy, the submarine will never be caught low in stored energy, lacking the ability either to evade or to attack. “Many short snorkelings” has a very pleasant sound to the ears and eyes of an airborne submarine hunter. This means there are many more opportunities to detect the snorkel and other masts with non-acoustic sensors (and depth-changing transients for passive acoustic sensors). A 1942 snorkel from a Swedish submarine. The snorkel would be raised on a mast to just enough above the water to allow exhaust to vent and fresh air to be exchanged., Wikimedia (Daderot) A recent article describes how partial or complete loss of GPS during a conflict (by spoofing or outright destruction of GPS satellites) might affect submarines. While they primarily rely on inertial navigation systems (INS) and quick, supporting GPS fixes when they come to periscope depth, during wartime, loss of GPS would force them to find another source to corroborate information provided by the INS. The article describes how to use a periscope as a sextant. But this type of periscope exposure, however brief, would provide an additional opportunity for an ASW aircraft to obtain radar contact. And there is nothing like a “radar-sinker”— a submarine that is detected on the surface but submerges quickly once it realizes it has been detected — to induce extreme salivation in the mouth of a hunter. The size of a diesel boat also affects how many and what types of sensors are available. The smaller the hull, the smaller the acoustic arrays used for finding targets. Acoustic array size can affect the sensor’s range and sensitivity. How many sonar techs on the sub does it take to monitor the various active and passive arrays as well as the towed array? How about the system that monitors the submarine’s own noise levels or the active sonar intercept screen? How much space do all the sensors’ processors take up? All these are critical factors that decide how well a diesel boat performs its mission. It wouldn’t be fair to have a discussion about the threat posed by diesel-electric submarines without mentioning Russia’s prolific Kilo-class, which serves in various configurations with nine naval arms, including U.S. allies and its two biggest peer competitors alike. , UK MOD A diesel submarine’s compact size is a major attraction for smaller navies because of the exorbitant cost of nuclear submarines, in terms of both sticker price and maintenance. Unfortunately, a navy’s smallness also affects its place in the world, which means its intelligence network isn’t as extensive as a larger one’s might be. Thus, an Indonesian Navy Type 209/1400 might have to spend more time at periscope depth looking for its prey, as opposed to an Australian Collins class that might know precisely where its target is from well-networked intel sources. Diesel Boats As Prey If the factors against the hunted are challenging, the hunter faces an environment far worse. Let’s return to size, because size does matter. Amid the disadvantages a small submarine brings, it offers some critical advantages as well: First, it is small . An active sonar pulse, particularly a high-frequency ping, tends to lose energy quickly in the water. A smaller target will reflect less energy. That energy will then be depleted even more on the journey back to the transducer/receiver. Now add to the equation a submarine covered with anechoic tiles or coating, and you essentially get mush—a very mushy return on your screen (if at all). Then, consider some old-school variables amid the constants: A submarine skipper is going to present the smallest aspect of his boat to the active sonar, particularly if there is only one active source. He is going to create environmental decoys — such as a knuckle, where he’ll turn abruptly or put the rudder over to starboard and then to port leaving a large disturbance in the water — for a ping to echo against. Or he may sprint forward and then back the boat into its own wake . S-3 and A-6 over a Russian Foxtrot class submarine. , USN Second, the hunted gains significant home-field advantages, since diesels tend to hang out in friendly littorals. You can be certain that an enemy diesel skipper will be intimately familiar with the seasonal and daily variations his acoustic environment offers. Shallow coastal water is a notoriously difficult environment for active, passive, and even non-acoustic sensors. Bottom composition, shoaling, currents, outflow of fresh water, weather, and biologics are all tantalizing security blankets a small submarine can wrap itself in. A third consideration is a skipper’s willingness to hide the submarine’s snorkel or surfaced hull among a host of environmental and man-made distractions always found on the surface. Non-acoustic searches are complicated by an abundance of radar contacts of all shapes and sizes, such as fishing boats, pleasure craft, barges, merchant ships, and navigation buoys. Fog, heavy seas, thunderstorms, coastal influence, and daily temperature variations are environmental changes that can encourage a diesel boat to take risks, greatly affecting an ASW aircraft’s acoustic and non-acoustic performance. One point in particular: Diesel skippers know how to hide among their nation’s fishing vessels . However, submarines tend to get caught in the nets of fishing vessels used by various types of fishing boats, so operations with a willing and organized fishing fleet require exceptional coordination and training. Since most fishing boats have diesel engines, the submarine’s skipper can run his own knowing that an ASW sensor operator will have a difficult time picking out one engine from, say, 27 others. Finally, the U. S. Navy hasn’t adapted its ASW weapons to shallow water operations. It has, however, been providing adversary submarines operating in the shallows with an advantage since the 1970s, despite the major end-of-Cold War philosophy change that moved the fleet from blue water to the littorals. We simply didn’t — and still don’t — have ASW weapons that are most effective in this environment. The benefits offered by the Mk 54 air-dropped and surface-launched torpedo over the Mk 46 still can’t defeat the horrendous acoustic conditions common in the shallows. We’ve put all our eggs in this basket and, considering the notorious performance of torpedoes in every war in which they’ve been used (resolved only late in the conflict, or not at all), we are putting our ships at great risk. A Viking drops a torpedo, identified in the original caption as a Mk 46 light torpedo in 1986. Note the torpedo just beginning to clear the weapon bay doors in the top image., Wikimedia/U.S. Navy Here is where the Russians and some of our allies have us beat. For our surface navy, we need to come up with a system similar to the Russian RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launcher. Better yet, we should support our friends and purchase Sweden’s ASW-601 , or bring back a simple, inexpensive system like the ol’ Hedgehog . The benefits of this system also include mine countermeasures and an anti-torpedo defense, both of which our warships need. For our aircraft, we need a simple, inexpensive depth charge that is similar to a Hedgehog device — bomblets, perhaps, such as an ASW version of the Mk 20 Rockeye cluster bomb . This would also mean developing a more effective magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) boom/bird to deal with a submarine in this environment. Funny how we seem to need to go back-to-the-future in 21st-century ASW. Oh, one more critical thing: The closer the hunter gets to an enemy coast, the greater the threat of enemy fighters, SAMs, and anti-aircraft guns. Finally, the most serious advantage we give to an enemy diesel submarine is our lack of realistic training. This was and continues to be the major problem. It is embarrassing to have to hear it from a fellow sailor playing the part of our enemy. We had a chance to listen back in August 1978 when the XO of the USS Barbel (SS-580), Lieutenant Commander William Marks, spelled it out for us in a brief, passionate piece in the Naval Institute Proceedings . USS Barbel (SS-580) completing a docking selected restrictive availability (DSRA) at Saebo Heavy Industries on Oct. 6, 1988., USN He starts off by reminding us that strategists and planners have failed historically to consider what an actual enemy will do during a time of war and translate that into realistic, effective training. He applies this truth to how we prepared for battle against Soviet diesel submarines: “The most obvious failing in training involves the exercises in which the diesel submarine is forced, by the operations order, to operate in a manner exactly the opposite of what a prudent submarine commander would do.” Pulling no punches, he then went after the jugular of the primary transgressor: Naval air ASW forces are the worst offenders of this apparent “head in the sand” training. By operational directive, naval aviators place the diesel submarine in a small circle, in deep, convergence zone water, devoid of merchant traffic or fishing craft, direct daylight snorkeling and predictable snorkel cycles, and top it off by labeling the exercise “freeplay.” He didn’t accuse us of trying to hide our ineptness or cook the books to look good because we would get an easy kill. Instead, he blamed us for not challenging ourselves to face what we would really see if we engaged the Soviets in a war at sea: We ought to train against the real diesel submarine threat—in shallow water, near beach noise and fishing fleets. We ought to train in darkness and over vast areas. We ought to train against aircraft crew boredom and disappointment. We ought to train against the uncertainty that a submarine really is there. We ought to train against realistic aircraft maintenance and sonobuoy assets. We ought to train against aircraft crews who are fatigued. And, finally, we ought to train against a diesel submarine that is permitted to exploit the environment to her advantage. He was a decade ahead of the Navy in pushing us to look a whole helluva lot harder at the littorals where the Soviet diesels were most assuredly going to wait for us. He is essentially saying, “It’s the chokepoints stupid! It’s the straits, the entrances to the ports of departure and arrival of the convoys, the naval bases, the GIUK gap , the entrance to the Fjords! ” A CIA image, with international borders as they were in 1983, of the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) Gap, a North Atlantic chokepoint through which Soviet submarines would have had to pass to reach the open Atlantic. , Wikimedia Post-Cold War analysis of the Soviet Navy’s plans, not to mention what analysts were saying while reading the Soviet naval journals during this period, confirmed this. Of course, many probably stopped reading Lt. Cdr. Marks’ article early on because he used the D word, mentioning the Navy’s decision not to continue to build diesel boats and how it affected our ability to effectively train against the non-nuclear submarine threat. Marks then proceeds to drive a stake through the heart of NAVAIR’s bastard children — Air ASW: “If we’re going to run highly structured, pro-aircraft exercises then let’s call them that so we can accurately assess all our capabilities.” Ouch! He then calls for exercising realistically by forcing us to go in blind and find a diesel boat where a diesel boat might be, under conditions that are real, complicated, and very difficult to work with. He concludes with a necessary insult: Then, after several such exercises, let us examine again our ASW capabilities against the Soviet diesel submarine. I’m certain one conclusion we can safely draw is that the Soviets need not invest any money in the development of a diesel submarine-launched antiaircraft weapon, until such time as a valid air threat exists. Ouch — fucking OUCH !! Thank you, XO! And thank God for such bitching-and-moaning realists. Sadly, as I’ve said before, we didn’t listen. The three Barbel class boats could not properly fulfill the need to train every ASW crew in both Atlantic and Pacific fleets and all carrier air wings and patrol squadrons. Once again, I never flew against a Barbel , and most of us only saw a diesel boat in a major, very structured exercise during deployments to the Med or the fjords. Let’s hope to God our women and men in ASW are being prepared for the South China Sea. How To Find A Diesel Boat From Above Now I’ll attempt to describe how we dealt with an exercise diesel boat (with respect to the Barbel ’s XO): The submarine “pulled the plug,” retracting its snorkel/periscope/masts when its electronic support measures (ESM) system detected a sweep of the S-3A’s AN/APS-116 radar. This is the classic radar-sinker . And yes, I mean a single sweep, depending on the specifics of the encounter. As the SENSO, I am running the radar and declare the loss of contact. The TACCO (tactical coordinator) sends my last radar fix to the pilot’s display and he turns our aircraft to the heading so we can mark on top (MOT) of that geographic position. The COTAC (copilot/co-tactical coordinator) makes a radio call to any ASW assets we are working with, such as a frigate trailing a towed array sonar, or the battle group ASW commander known as Alpha-Xray to inform them of a possible submarine contact. If the submarine or its masts weren’t seen visually (or imaged, should this have been a scenario in the S-3B using the AN/APS-137 ISAR radar) as we approached, we would instinctively drop a passive sonobuoy to classify the contact, unless there was a clear indication it was a diesel boat. Such indications could include exhaust smoke still visible around the area where the mast’s feather ends; sonobuoys already seeded in relatively close proximity that show a very distinct change on the display; or “lost contact” called by an escort that had passive contact on a possible diesel submarine’s engine signature. If this is the case, then we would drop AN/SSQ-62 DICASS buoys — equipped with active sonar — in a prearranged pattern. In the Viking, I could monitor multiple active sonobuoys at one time. Normally, though, we dropped just two at a time to conserve them (because of their cost and because we carried so few). As the hydrophone dropped to initial depth, I would begin pinging to determine if we had a subsurface contact and see if they were still “above the thermal layer.” If no return after a few pings, the TACCO would “send the hydrophone” to its maximum depth, below the layer. A sailor loads sonobuoys onto a P-3C Orion aircraft., U.S. Navy/Photographer’s Mate 1st Class John Collins Due to the inherent delay of computer processing of information, it was absolutely critical to have the sonobuoy tuned up to my headset so I could listen in real-time. If a submarine was there, I could hear the echo in my helmet before I saw it on my display. To get a solid return echo on the first ping from the first buoy was a sound to behold ! Now, the trick was to maintain contact as the other buoys were being dropped. This is where enlisted sensor operators realized we were playing a game of chess with the skipper of the submarine, mano a mano . Of course, we couldn’t do it without the crew and the airplane, but this was the true moment for us, I think. It was you against him. As the ping emanated from the sonobuoy’s transducer and displayed across my screen, I’d begin calling doppler, buoy number, range, and bearing while marking the return. The nature of the return depended on all the tactics I described above. It was something not only heard, but also felt by the SENSO’s own physical senses as his eyes analyzed the target’s “image” on the screen — usually just a horizontal line to the untrained eye. As I marked a return, the TACCO and COTAC’s screens were provided with an initial symbol generated by the active acoustic portion of the software. The TACCO could then “merge” all the tracks from other sensors and update the Link 11 tactical datalink so every asset throughout the battle group can see a common “picture” of the situation. As more buoys started transmitting, I would ping them as well. I needed to keep the submarine boxed in with sound. The additional buoys provided a solid fix with visual lines of bearing extending from each of their symbols on the TACCO’s screen. We played the game as long as necessary, but active sonobuoys were extremely expensive, and we didn’t waste them. Besides, were it a real threat, the initial solid ping returns and fixes usually met the criteria for a torpedo drop. That was easy. But if you recall, I did start by saying ASW against a diesel boat is assuredly difficult . No good skipper is going to tolerate more than a few pings before he slips away, and our subsequent active pulses will just spread longingly out across a now seemingly empty, echoless ocean. Thus, it is always better to invite friends. Another Viking, carrying the same amount or more active buoys (and torpedoes, if we weren’t armed) should have been vectored to us by the E-2 Hawkeye . Far better, you hoped you were within range of a couple of Sea King ASW Helicopters. A helicopter anti-submarine squadron HS-8 Eightballers Sikorsky SH-3H Sea King helicopter lowers an AQS-13 dipping sonar over the ocean during a training mission. HS-8 was based aboard the aircraft carrier USS Constellation (CV-64) as part of Carrier Air Wing Fourteen (CVW-14) for a deployment to the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean from 1 December 1988 to 1 June 1989, USN The arrival of two SH-3s always made the evading submariner’s life expectancy questionable. Of course, during wartime, we would also hope to hear the distinct end-of-life sounds emanating from the submarine amid the reverberations of a Mk 46 torpedo explosion. Necessary sounds … but for me, they would have been the saddest sounds I could ever have heard. AIP: What The Well-Dressed Navy Is Wearing Now, about those AIP (air-independent propulsion) submarines. For me, AIP boats have always been something of a mystery. During my time in ASW, the Stirling engine was the only AIP system in use (other than nuclear), and that was a curiosity. I never flew an ASW mission against one. In my ignorance, I was thinking: “Why all the fuss and worry? A turbine and its associated drivetrain, running submerged, make enough noise to track passively. And a diesel engine? Completely submerged? That’s the loudest noise in the world! What are we so worried about?” Then I read two excellent books AIP boats— Submarine Technology for the 21st Century (2nd Ed) by Stan Zimmerman (Trafford Publishing, 2006) and Quieter, Deeper, Faster: Innovations in German Submarine Construction by Jurgen Rohweder (Maximilian Verlag, 2017) — and now I know what we are worried about. I won’t go into the history of the design and development of AIP systems, because plenty has already been written about it. Instead, let’s talk about their scary strengths and exploitable weaknesses — if they have such weaknesses — and then I’ll offer some of my own ASW-oriented thoughts. China has greatly expanded its advanced diesel-electric submarine fleet in recent years to go with its larger fleet expansion ambitions. These boats are well suited for prowling the littorals, especially much of the South China Sea that Beijing claims as its own territory. , MARK SCHIEFELBEIN/AFP via Getty Images The nuclear submarine’s unchallenged superiority in endurance and sustained speed is an exciting and effective foundation for any country’s perceived or realistic naval needs. However, the prohibitive costs of acquiring and maintaining nuclear-powered attacks submarines (SSNs), as well as a litany of other political and regulatory factors , prevent most navies from building their maritime strategy on the bedrock of such a design. AIP is the obvious alternative, and the choices available offer many benefits, including creating a massive headache for historically dominant navies that don’t like to have their sea power certitude challenged. So, let’s look at three AIP options here: closed-cycle steam turbine, the Stirling Engine, and the fuel cell, as well as consider the newest upgrade to underwater power — lithium-ion batteries. Steam Turbines The closed-cycle turbine is similar to a nuclear-powered steam turbine, except burning ethanol generates the heat instead of a nuclear reaction. While several navies experimented with it, only the French committed themselves to its development for submarines—the MESMA, or Module d’Energie Sous-Marine Autonome system. The French-designed Scorpene class, which several navies have acquired, can employ a MESMA turbine. The Agosta 90B class submarines, like the ones Pakistan operates as the Khalid class , also use MESMA. Some sources suggest this AIP system has an endurance of around 16 days at four knots without the need to snorkel. One of the important benefits of the turbine is its ability to maintain a constant speed for all aspects of the submarine’s performance, because it is connected to the electric motors through an alternator, whereas a closed-cycle diesel must vary its RPMs. Not much is known about the performance and success/failure of the MESMA system. The apparent weaknesses are that the turbine isn’t very quiet, and an excessive amount of exploitable heat is produced. Stirling Engines The Stirling Engine is a very well-known system that has been around for more than two centuries. Famously, Sweden’s Stirling-engined submarine Gotland made an enduring mark on the U.S. Navy . The first full-scale submarine Stirling engine was added as a “plug,” or hull-section, to the Kockums’-built HSwMS Näcken in the mid-late ‘80s. The engine’s quietness surprised its designers and the Swedish Navy. In the Stirling cycle, the fuel is continuously burned, whereas, in a diesel engine, the combustion is an explosive, noise-generating process. In fact, the motive machinery associated with the Stirling revealed itself to be much noisier than the combustion. Thus, Kockums’ engineers had to ensure that all machinery mounts were placed on rafts to reduce detectable vibration through the hull. Reported submerged endurance varies, but sources indicate anywhere from 14 to 30 days. The liquid oxygen (LOX) required for combustion of the diesel fuel is located in stainless steel containers that “are the most expensive part of the Stirling AIP system,” according to Zimmerman’s book. The Swedish Navy continues to trust the Stirling system and has incorporated it into its new and provocative Blekinge class submarine (A26 program). Other countries use a Stirling system, too. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) uses it in the Soryu class , the Royal Singapore Navy in the Archer class (formerly the Swedish Västergötland class), and the Type 039A Yuan -class submarines of the Chinese Navy also employs it. The Stirling engine has several inherent weaknesses that might contribute to operational constraints. According to Zimmerman, one can be found in the atmospheric limitations of its combustor, which prevents Stirling-powered submarines from diving deeper than 650 feet. Of course, in Swedish waters and the Baltic littorals, this may not be a problem. Also, it “cannot accept radical changes in power demand.” Sweden’s AIP-equipped submarine Gotland , shown here in San Diego in 2005, with the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan in the background. The submarine reportedly made multiple undetected torpedo-launch runs on the U.S. Navy ship during an exercise off California that year., U.S. Navy/Photographer’s Mate 1st Class Michael Moriatis Like the MESMA turbine, Stirlings apparently produce an exploitable heat signature. Finally, according to Jurgen Rohweder, “The engine’s efficiency is significantly lower and fuel consumption correspondingly high. This is the most probable reason why most of the countries experimenting with the Stirling engine have abandoned it at the end.” Perhaps it is a contributing factor that influenced both the JMSDF and the Royal Singapore Navy’s decision not to include the Stirling in their newest submarine designs: the Taeigi class and the Invincible class, respectively. There are a few additional weaknesses to AIP technology. Most important, AIP is expensive. And the nations developing AIP have not become completely committed believers in the technology — none has created a submarine solely powered by AIP. I get that it is designed for those moments when a submarine needs to be a submarine. But the diesel engine and batteries required for routine, safe cruising in and out of port and patrolling when AIP use isn’t important, take up a significant amount of space, add a tremendous amount of weight and size to the design, and cost that much more money. Yes, almost all nuclear submarines do have an auxiliary diesel engine and battery compartment (with the interesting exception being the Soviet Navy Papa class SSGN), but comparatively, it is substantially smaller and used only in emergencies or while in port. Fuel Cells Now, the system that has transformed the painful headache experienced by ASW forces into a migraine is the fuel cell. There are many types and several countries are developing them, but I’ll focus on German Type 212 and 214 submarines. “The fuel cell has evolved into an electrochemical device producing electricity without combustion,” writes Rohweder. “The electro-chemical reactions between fuel and an oxidant, which leads to the direct production of electricity … and the greatest progress has been made with the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.” The German Navy U34 type U212A submarine visits Gdynia, Poland, in November 2015. The U34 uses a fuel-cell for submerged power generation., Nur Photo/Getty Images Fuel cells are highly efficient, and they make absolutely no sound . Most of the heat produced by the chemical reaction is employed by the system to extract hydrogen from the metal hydride storage containers. The rest is discharged overboard but apparently leaves a minimal signature. Unlike lead-acid batteries, the fuel-cell system requires no maintenance while at sea (only monitoring). This point alone has a multilayered impact: With a reduction of crew, you have a reduction of crew weight; you have a reduced need for supplies (which take up space); and the actual space for those crewmembers to live and work leaves room for critical sensor and weapon systems as well as machinery. The diminished reliance on snorkeling means there is less stress on the crew, thereby allowing for greater focus on the submarine’s tactical mission. Reports of fuel-cell submerged endurance vary, but the standard response is 14 days. However, three to four weeks is commonly accepted, with some claiming up to eight weeks! The fuel cells allow for high sustained underwater speeds and, in conjunction with the batteries, such as lithium-ion technology, those rates could be maintained in a manner that can wreak havoc on any surface fleet. The ASW migraine is only enhanced by a new generation of electric motors. “Advances in solid-state power conditioning equipment and rare-earth magnets are creating an electric motor half the size and weight—for the same output—as conventional units,” writes Zimmerman. The winding we are so used to in electric motors has been replaced by permanent magnets (PM). The Type 212 submarine (used by the German and Italian navies) and the Type 214 (used by Greece, Portugal, and South Korea), use the Siemens Permasyn PM Motor. This motor, says Jurgen Rohweder, “has particularly low vibrations and emits little heat and noise, which together further contribute to a submarine’s undetectability.” Lithium-Ion Batteries The lithium-ion battery (LIB) is the latest technology being applied to diesel submarines. More than just a much-desired replacement for the standard lead-acid battery (LAB), Japan has been working to perfect the LIB for much of the 21st century. Clearly, with the launch of the second Taigei ( “Big Whale” ) class submarine , the Hakugei (“ White Whale “), a few weeks ago, the JMSDF is comfortable with the performance and safety of the technology; so much so, that it will no longer rely on the cumbersome Stirling engines that provide AIP propulsion for their previous boats, the Sōryū class. Indeed, lithium-ion batteries could allow some navies to dispense with all the complexity, weight, and, in some cases, the detectability of AIP machinery altogether. In essence, the LIB technology represents the dream of what a diesel-electric boat could possibly be. Depending on the needs of the navy, they offer their own kind of replacement for AIP technology, allowing for much longer dives than their LAB-equipped brethren, all without the complexity of having a separate AIP propulsion technology on board, although they do have unique fire suppression and other requirements. Compared to AIP and LAB submarines, LIB cells can also take up considerably less space, allowing for more cells in compartments already allocated for batteries. Or, since space is always at a premium on a submarine, the area planned for an AIP plug can now be used for additional sensors, special operations capability, crew spaces, additional weapons, or even more batteries. ASW crews love to interrupt a diesel boat that is surfaced or snorkeling to recharge its batteries. A LAB submarine needs, ideally, an uninterrupted half an hour — up to several hours — to obtain a full charge, depending on the quality of the batteries. Forcing the submarine to completely submerge when it has only attained, say, a 36 percent charge creates a difficult environment for the skipper. How long will the ASW force keep me down? Will I be interrupted again? With only a 36 percent charge, can I realistically get away from a determined hunter? If a torpedo is in the water, how long can I maintain speed to evade the weapon? The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force submarine Taigei “ Big Whale “) at its launching ceremony in 2020. The Taigei uses lithium-ion batteries in lieu of an AIP or lead-acid batteries for underwater power., JMSDF Unfortunately, “interrupting” a submarine with lithium-ion batteries is very unlikely. LIB cells recharge at a significantly faster rate than LAB cells. They also can discharge a greater amount of energy, which translates into higher speeds, and the batteries will maintain that high level of energy even as the charge is depleted. This allows the skipper to get away from or pursue a threat, even a nuclear submarine — if the conditions are right. Also, the investment a navy makes into lithium-ion technology is rewarded by the fact that the batteries keep most of their fast-charging ability and high-energy output throughout their lives. LIBs can also be paired with existing AIP technology to dramatically increase the capabilities of these already remarkably capable boats. This is exactly what South Korea is doing with their KSS-III Batch 2 submarines. Navalnews.com reports that Moon-hee Jang of Hanwha Defense says the new configuration will last 300 percent longer at full speed and 160 percent longer in cruise mode, also adding: “Batch-2 submarines will have both AIP propulsion systems and lithium-ion batteries, which will increase the submerged endurance to more than 20 days at sea.” And it’s possible that the AIP system can charge the batteries while submerged. That is a stunning performance boost for a diesel-electric submarine, and the pairing of the technologies offers incredible flexibility that would greatly complicate a submarine hunter’s mission. Finally, a very critical point is made by the authors of this article encouraging the U.S. Navy to have a serious talk with the Japanese regarding LIBs: “All navies are rapidly developing and integrating large fleets of battery-powered [unmanned] submersibles.” As the U.S. Navy pursues unmanned air, surface, and subsurface vehicles, the use of Japanese-developed LIB technology can only enhance their performance and reliability. Of course, AIP or advanced battery technology alone is not enough for submariners! Advances in propellor-blade technology and hydrodynamic hull designs (which, added to fuel cells’ capability for high speeds, allows for excellent sprint-drift operations), demagnetized hull materials, anechoic coatings, and sensor and weapons capabilities ( including the submarine-fired SAM ), and I think today’s ASW crews might be fucked. New Means Of Detection Not long ago, I read an article co-written by a retired admiral who happened to have been a naval oceanographer. He was describing the need for the Navy to start paying closer attention to non-acoustic means of detection of submarines, particularly the effects of bioluminescence. Navy Cdr. Rob Brodie and retired Rear Adm. Tom Donaldson illustrated how “light produced by disturbed bioluminescent plankton is an ocean signature; a submarine cannot prevent the ocean from glowing.” The authors recommend that the Navy equip all ASW platforms, particularly unmanned drones, with low-light sensors and advanced processors with AI technology to decipher and alert sensor operators to highly potential submarine contacts. We must take the non-acoustic possibilities very seriously. The Russians have been studying a wide range of non-acoustic options for decades in the face of their comparatively poor passive acoustic capabilities during the Cold War. They and most likely the Chinese are light years ahead of us. This leads to some of my own thoughts about how to meet the threat: – Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are already being deployed by submarines from all navies. ASW sensor operators need to be trained on every type of UUV and their passive acoustic signatures, as well as what they sound like in real-time. UUVs will have unique signatures, and navies may not be investing money into the quieting of their machinery for the moment. If an operator can acoustically classify a specific type of UUV known to be launched from a submarine, then she has also localized the threat, the mother submarine. A Chinese HSU-001 unmanned underwater vehicle. , AP – The defense industry needs to help us hear better. We need better processors that can pick out a slow-revolution, seven-skewed-blade propeller from a field of very loud biologics and peripheral shipping noise. We need airborne, surface, and subsurface operators well trained in listening to the sounds an ocean makes. I’ve said it before, but I was poorly trained in “aural” acoustics, and it seems the developers of the newest processing equipment were neglectful in providing enhanced, real-time listening capabilities (probably because we weren’t taking it seriously). – I would encourage the Navy to require all junior submarine Sonar Techs (STs) to do at least one patrol (or a couple of weeks during at-sea training periods) on a ballistic-missile submarine (SSBN) , early in their careers. There, they can listen to sounds expressed by the ocean for hours on end. Unlike attack submarines, SSBNs spend a significant amount of their time boring holes in a limited part of the ocean, which provides an ideal training environment for the STs. Doing this type of listening, I believe, would create “muscle memory” for them to be able to aurally differentiate the slightest acoustic change that an extremely quiet fuel-cell submarine or distant UUV would bring. As our resident undersea warfare expert has said : “Sonarmen are trained to detect changes in patterns. A sharp metallic transient object is out of place in the natural undersea world … The experienced sailor can quickly identify these changes.” In the comment section of that article, he makes a key point: “Finding a diesel boat passively is largely dependent on diesel-boat crew mistakes or poor maintenance.” Peer combat is like that. It comes down to who makes the first mistake. I’m all for accelerating novice sonar techs to “experienced sailors” and immersion in the actual environment can only help. I would also love to see the best STs from destroyers, STs destined for the Constellation -class frigates, and the sensor operators flying in P-8 Poseidons and MH-60s get that same opportunity as well. In addition, actual acoustic recordings from previous patrols made by SSBNs can be distributed to all the above platforms for individual or group training (however, motivating individuals to listen to them while ashore or on their own time is a very difficult task, as opposed to actually standing a watch aboard a submarine). Sonar Technicians aboard the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS The Sullivans ., USN – Allied navies have long neglected research and operational development of all non-acoustic ASW options. In our arrogance, we put all our eggs in the passive acoustic basket as we relied on the noisiness of Soviet submarines. Now, with the proliferation of diesel submarines and AIP technology, we are in danger of doing it again with low-frequency active sonar. We need to invest heavily in nontraditional ways to find a submarine. Exploit the heat signatures of MESMA turbines and Stirling engines at all depths. Exploit submarine wake “signatures.” Consider the molecular-level effects a submarine has on the ocean. Employ marine biologists to study the effects the presence of a submarine has on biological species and, if significant, teach sensor operators to detect them. – Oceanography! We do not know the ocean, despite our past exploration of her. She is a mystery that is constantly changing, particularly the Arctic Ocean. We need to be able to peel back the surface and understand the variables the depths provide. The Navy should be investing heavily in oceanography research and recruiting more officers and enlisted to become professional oceanographers. We also need more complex, real-time oceanographic sensors that provide far more detail of a specific on-scene area. We need more than a single bathythermographic or “BT” buoy that only reveals the temperature gradient of one tiny column of water. – Here it comes! The U.S. Navy needs its own AIP submarines to train its ASW professionals and perform operational missions . We cannot rely on exercises with allies that happen only rarely, under sterilized, prepackaged conditions. Getting to fly “on top” of a Type 214 boat in the Med or in the Sea of Japan once every two years doesn’t cut it — and acoustic training from tapes, while helpful to a certain degree, ultimately doesn’t create the real-world conditions our warriors need to prepare for war. Before I fully understood the implications of AIP, I believed there was nothing new to fear in the old. I was wrong. In fact, if you take into account propulsion, tactics, and implementation by adversary navies, there really isn’t anything old about the new. Once again, we have placed ourselves in a disadvantaged position. ASW created the dragon that is AIP— but there is no reason ASW can’t develop the means to slay it.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elements of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps recently kicked off an amphibious exercise with the Israel Defense Forces that have placed American forces on the ground in Israel to train. Though the United States and Israel have strong and long-standing military ties, the actual interactions between the two often have been discreet in the past for political reasons. This has been changing in recent years , and this exercise comes less than a month after both countries said they were exploring a possible “ Plan B ” with regard to Iran if the regime in Tehran did not return to compliance with a multinational deal over its nuclear ambitions . The Navy’s Task Force 51 and the Marine Corps’ 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) will oversee the forces from their respective services in this exercise, which officially began on Nov. 1 . Task Force 51 is in charge of all amphibious operations in the Middle East, as well as around the Horn of Africa and in parts of the Indian Ocean, as part of U.S. Fifth Fleet and U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT). The 5th MEB is a deployable expeditionary headquarters that supports Marine Corps activities in these same regions. 5th MEB is a component of Task Force 51 and they are often referred to singularly as Task Force 51/5th MEB . The San Antonio class landing platform dock amphibious ship sails in the North Arabian Sea in September. This ship is currently taking part in exercise together with Israeli forces., USN Right now, it is known that the San Antonio class amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland — which official Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accounts have erroneously referred to as an “aircraft carrier” and a “helicopter carrier” — is participating in the exercise. Pictures of Portland docked in Israel’s southern port city of Eilat, on the Red Sea , the hub for this exercise, show CH-53E Sea Stallion heavy-lift helicopters on its rear flight deck. It’s unclear if the ship is carrying any other aircraft. Beyond its normal weapons and other systems, Portland is equipped with a directed-energy laser weapon that is intended to provide additional defenses against swarms of small boats and small unmanned aircraft. It can also blind or confuse optical sensors or seekers on incoming weapons and has full-motion video cameras that can be used for surveillance, as well as detecting and tracking targets. “Approximately 500 personnel from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit [MEU], including one logistics battalion detachment, one infantry rifle company, a light armored reconnaissance company, and a HIMARS [ High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ] platoon,” will take part in the exercise, according to 5th Fleet/NAVCENT. The 11th MEU and Portland are both in the region on a regular deployment as part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), which has the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Essex at its core. It is unclear how many IDF personnel from which units will take part in this exercise, which is scheduled to continue over the next three weeks. “The exercise includes military operations in urban terrain, infantry live-fire training, [HIMARS] live-fire and rapid maneuvering training, as well as professional exchanges on various topics including engineering, medical, and explosive ordnance disposal ,” 5th Fleet/NAVCENT said. “This exercise is part of the next chapter in the U.S. Navy’s and Marine Corps’ longstanding relationship with Israel that is so vital to stability and security in the region,” Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Farrell Sullivan, the commander of Task Force 51/5th MEB, said in a statement. The Red Sea, in and around which this exercise will take place, is highly strategic, with the Suez Canal at its northern end and the Bab Al Mandeb Strait in the south forming chokepoints for the movement of maritime forces and commercial shipping. Saudi Arabian F-15 combat jets fly together with a U.S. Air Force B-1B bomber over the Red Sea in October 2021., USAF This body of water has been a flashpoint on numerous occasions in recent years , especially in the southern end around Yemen. Iranian-backed Houthi militants in that country regularly launch drone and missile attacks on military and civilian targets, including at sea and in neighboring Saudi Arabia . Concerns are growing about the potential threat that group might pose to southern Israel, including Eilat. As already noted, U.S. military cooperation, including participation in exercise in Israel, has been increasingly public in recent years. Just last month, U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets touched down in the country to take part in its biennial Blue Flag aerial combat exercise , which also includes a number of other foreign allies and partners. In October, an Air Force B-1B bomber circumnavigated the Arabian Peninsula , flying alongside Israeli jets at one point. Earlier this year, the U.S. military shifted regional responsibility for activities in Israel from U.S. European Command (EUCOM) to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). What might seem like an innocuous administrative decision in fact reflects changes in political attitudes within the United States and in the Middle East. A number of Arab countries have normalized relations with Israel in recent years, and others may do the same soon . This has imparted significant changes to the still-complicated political landscape in the region that have made it easier on some levels for American forces to work with their Israeli counterparts more freely and openly. The exercise is, if nothing else, a prime example of how the U.S. military and the IDF are likely to train and otherwise interact more publicly as time goes on. It also comes at a time when both countries have been heavily engaged in discussions over how to respond to Iranian aggression in the Middle East and beyond, as well as that country’s nuclear and missile programs , along with a host of other regional security issues. The United States and Iran have been in a diplomatic stalemate for months over the future of a 2015 deal regarding Tehran’s nuclear aspirations. The U.S. government withdrew from that agreement unilaterally in 2018 and Iran is now violating all of its key tenets. “We will look at every option to deal with the challenge posed by Iran,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the press in October around a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and United Arab Emirates (UAE) Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyanin in Washington, D.C. “And we continue to believe that diplomacy is the most effective way to do that. But, it takes two to engage in diplomacy, and we have not seen from Iran a willingness to do that at this point.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, right, watches as Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid addresses the press in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, 2021., AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool Israel, as well as American forces in various locations around the Middle East, regularly face threats from the regime in Tehran and its proxies, including from the aforementioned Houthis in Yemen. In particular, drone attacks on various military and civilian targets have become almost routine. It was reported last week that U.S. officials believe, unsurprisingly, that Iranian proxies were responsible for a recent drone attack on a facility in Syria near the borders with Iraq and Jordan where American troops work alongside local forces. The U.S. military also blamed Iran, or elements acting under its direction, for launching a fatal drone attack on an Israeli-operated tanker ship earlier this year. This was the latest incident in a tit-for-tat shadow war between Israel and Iran that has seen the two countries attack each other’s commercial and military ships . This three-week-long U.S.-Israeli exercise in and around Eilat only underscores the ties between the American and Israeli militaries, which are only becoming more and more public, in the face of various regional threats, especially those emanating from Iran.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 31, 2021",This Is The Damage Done To That Huge Container Ship That Clogged The Suez Canal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The world was gripped for six days in March by the story of the Ever Given , one of the world’s biggest container ships, that had gotten stuck sideways in the Suez canal. One of the most important shipping arteries on earth was plugged tight by the 1,312-foot long behemoth as ships stacked up waiting for passage . It was a logistical nightmare playing out in slow motion and a financial one for Egypt and those associated with the operations of the Ever Given . Finally, on March 29, 2021, after frantically trying to break free for days, she budged, and soon the canal was open once again. The global event that brought much attention to how fragile the global supply chain can become, was over. After waiting in limbo for months, and protracted negotiations between Egyptian officials and Ever Given’s owners and operators, she was set free and left Egyptian territory. The damaged ship was then offloaded, and she eventually headed to China for some much-needed repairs. Ever Given would not budge for days, causing a massive logistical traffic jam., NASA Professor at Campbell University and military historian Sal Mercogliano gave The War Zone the rundown on the Ever Given’s slow route to China: “She offloaded at Rotterdam and Felixstowe, and then sailed to China. She bunkered off Malta and had to slow steam due to restrictions on her by the ABS [American Bureau of Shipping]. She has been waiting for the bow to be completed before arriving in Qingdao.” As Mercogliano notes, the reason she had to wait to be repaired all these months was that she needed an entirely new lower bow. There was no use in putting the ship into dry dock without that prefabricated module being ready for installation. Now out of the water, we finally get to see the damage that was done to the ship, which displaces a whopping 266,000 tons fully loaded (equal to two and a half Nimitz class supercarriers), that occurred as a result of getting her unstuck. The damage done to her bow is remarkable considering how massive this vessel is. The amount of force it took to do this to her is incredible to ponder. The bottom of her bulbous bow looks like a dropped pumpkin. Hopefully, once the repairs are done, the Ever Given will be able to finally move on from the harrowing incident that made her so famous.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to glitzy ads, nobody is a bigger tease than Northrop Grumman. Who can blame them? With so much intellectual property and hardware hiding in the shadows, there is no better way to garner interest than to play all that up. I mean, who can forget the company’s Superbowl ad prior to winning the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) contract that would morph into the B-21 Raider? Now a new ad gives us a hangar full of types to examine, and then some. Of course, this is all in good fun. The company is not going to out their most sensitive designs for marketing’s sake. Still, it is fun to see what they put forward for our enjoyment and as a bit of a ‘hint-hint.’ The new ad, which plays on their past ‘hangar’ settings , is set around an elevator opening into a bustling hangar with its bay door open. The space is filled with Northrop Grumman aircraft — from the present and the not-so-distant future. It definitely offers a lot to look at in a very short time. In fact, it looks a bit like a scene from a Michael Bay movie. Check it out below: So, what do we have to look at here? the hangar seems to be divided into the future and now. You can also look at it possibly as Navy on the right and Air Force on the left, although this doesn’t hold up perfectly. Let’s break it down from the left front to right front: This looks like a notional Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) manned platform. The Air Force and the Navy have parallel programs to develop their own NGAD concepts, which will be a family of systems, including unmanned aircraft and a long-range manned tactical type. This fits the bill. It’s very big, stealthy, and has no vertical tails. It also has a hell of a chine line that wraps around the airframe. Its dorsal intake is also a very stealthy attribute. It is hard to tell, but if there is just one and not another intake on the other side, with the spine behind the cockpit flowing into it, it looks a bit similar to the Model 401 ‘Son of ARES’ demonstrators that were built by Northrop Grumman’s subsidiary Scaled Composites and are currently undergoing secretive test work . Still, it is likely the design has two intakes, one on each side. An NGAD demonstrator of some sort is already flying. It could be Northrop Grumman’s for all we know, but there are likely to be major opportunities surrounding NGAD as the program spins up. Clearly, if they aren’t involved now, they really want to be. Next, we have the pointy white nose that looks like one of Northrop Grumman’s new affordable loyal wingman and unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) concepts. One of these is derived from — you guessed it — the Model 401, while the other is directly based on it. You can read about this family of airframes that Northrop Grumman wants to build for the Pentagon and possibly allied nations in this past post of ours. Farthest back on the left is a flying-wing unmanned combat air vehicle very similar to the company’s promising X-47B demonstrators that were painfully passed over by the Navy for a tanker and surveillance drone known today as MQ-25 Stingray. Boeing ended up winning that tender. Northrop Grumman recently told The War Zone that they are doing something new with the two X-47B airframes that were in storage. Hopefully, this is an indication of a second chance at life for the type or an offshoot of its cranked-kite flying wing design, as well as the procurement of a proper high-end, low-observable UCAV. More on this puzzling saga here. Northrop Grumman’s concept art for the Air Force’s MQ-Next initiative for what will replace the MQ-9 Reaper looked just like an X-47B. Regardless, the one shown in the video is carrier-capable, at least based on its nose bear launch bar. In the dead center, we have the B-2 Spirit , seemingly bridging the gap between tomorrow and today. Oh and far in the background appears to be a B-21 Raider or an RQ-180 taking off — they share a similar planform . Almost certainly this is to indicate the B-21 — it is not like the very real and still highly classified RQ-180’s attendance is mandatory for a fun television spot! They look similar anyway, at least as far as we know. Then on the rear right, we have the EA-18G Growler . Northrop Grumman is a major player in its electronic warfare systems. Next in line, we have an E-2D Hawkeye , the extremely capable latest variation of the Navy’s venerable airborne early warning and control aircraft that Northrop Grumman builds and the Navy buys. And finally, the MQ-4C Triton , the maritime surveillance derivative of the Q-4 Global Hawk. So there you have it! Northrop Grumman having a bit of fun showing off some of their future works in progress, even in just a notional manner, as well as what they have got going on now. There are plenty of other initiatives not indicated here, but regardless, it provides some expected eye candy for yet another quintessential Northrop Grumman ad. They always leave us wanting more, don’t they? UPDATE: Northrop Grumman has posted a high-definition extended version of the ad.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 19, 2021",The Navy’s Stealth Destroyers Will Have Their Deck Guns Replaced With Hypersonic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it plans to begin converting the first of its Zumwalt class destroyers to fire the service’s future Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic weapons, or IRCPS, in the 2024 Fiscal Year. The launchers for these missiles, which will be loaded onto the ship’s inside triple-packed Advanced Payload Module canisters, will replace the 155mm Advanced Gun Systems on these stealthy destroyers. The Navy decided back in 2016 not to buy any ammunition for those guns due to ballooning costs, rendering them effectively dead weight and prompting discussions about the possibility of installing other weapons in their place. Naval News first reported this new schedule information. The Navy’s budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, released earlier this year, had already revealed that the service hopes to have some level of operational capability to launch IRCPS missiles from its Zumwalt class ships by the end of 2025. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday had previously confirmed the basic plan for adding hypersonic missiles to these destroyers, which are also referred to as DDG-1000s after the hull number of the lead ship, USS Zumwalt , during a talk at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank in April. The Navy is planning to integrate IRCPS onto its future Block V Virginia class submarines , likely using the Advanced Payload Module (APM) canisters, as well, and the weapon could find its way onto other vessels . The Zumwalt class destroyer USS Michael Monsoor ., USN “The DDG-1000 Dry-Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) will begin in FY 2024,” Lieutenant Lewis Aldridge, a spokesperson for the Navy’s Office of the Chief of Information, told Naval News . “The Navy began engineering planning efforts to accommodate integration of CPS on Zumwalt -class destroyers, which includes removal of advanced gun system mounts and installation of Advanced Payload Module (APM) launcher technology.” The Navy has commissioned two Zumwalt class destroyers in service, the USS Zumwalt and the USS Michael Monsoor . The third ship in the class, the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson , is still in the process of being fitted out. Lieutenant Aldridge said that the IRCPS launch systems would only occupy spaces previously occupied by the Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) and that there are no plans to add any additional vertical launch system (VLS) cells to the Zumwalt class destroyers. The DDG 1000s each have 80 Mk 57 VLS launch cells. At present, these cells are expected to be loaded with a mix of SM-2 Block IIIAZ and Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) surface-to-air missiles, the latter of which can be quad-packed into a single cell, as well as Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles. Of course, other types of missiles, such as variants of the ever-more-capable SM-6 family , could be added to the destroyers’ arsenals in the future, as well. The Navy did not confirm to Naval News how many IRCPS missiles the converted stealth destroyers will be able to carry at once, though it has been reported that up to 12 of these weapons could be loaded onto each ship in the future. This would mean two APMs would take the place of each of the AGS turrets. This may seem like a limited number, but each one of these missiles will reportedly be some 34 and a half inches in diameter and could be 30 feet or more in length. By comparison, a Tomahawk has a length of some 20 and a half feet, including a rocket booster necessary to fire it from a VLS cell, and less than 20 and a half inches in diameter. IRCPS’ expected dimensions are based on what is known about the U.S. Army’s ground-based Dark Eagle Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system. Dark Eagle and IRCPS are using the same missile design, with a common unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top, with how they are launched being the only difference between the two. A US Army infographic showing components of the complete Dark Eagle Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system at right, as well as the common missile components it shares with the US Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) system, at left., US Army These missiles, like other designs using hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, use rocket boosters to get their payload to a desired speed and altitude. Once there, the vehicle separates from the rest of the weapon and glides back down toward its target, flying along an atmospheric trajectory at a hypersonic speed, typically defined as anything above Mach 5. Boost-glide vehicles are also designed to be highly maneuverable, allowing for more unpredictable movements over the course of their flight compared to typical ballistic missiles, even those with advanced maneuverable reentry vehicles. This presents significant challenges for opponents in terms of detecting the incoming weapon and responding to it, including any attempts to intercept the threat. Giving an enemy less time to react also reduces their ability to relocate critical assets or just seek cover. All of this, in turn, means hypersonic weapons present an ideal choice for penetrating through even the densest air and missile defenses to strike high-value and potentially time-sensitive targets. The DDG-1000s are the most advanced and survivable surface combatants the Navy has available to it now, despite years of watering down of their capabilities , including by adding external systems that increase their radar signature . Integrating IRCPS onto these destroyers could open up new missions for them, either while operating independently or as part of larger surface actions groups. Their stealthy qualities, in particular, would improve their ability to get within range of their targets, even ones relatively deep inside enemy territory, even just to hold them at risk as a deterrent during a major crisis. At the same time, questions have repeatedly been raised about the exact operational utility of a class of three ships. At present, the Lyndon B. Johnson , which left port for its first sea trials in August, isn’t even expected to be commissioned until 2023. All three examples are expected to be assigned to a developmental unit, Surface Developmental Squadron One , though the Navy insists that they will make regular operational deployments. The Navy originally planned to buy 32 DDG-1000s, but scaled that order back multiple times before settling on purchasing a trio of these destroyers. This had the knock-on effect of sending the unit cost for each one of these ships skyrocketing, from the original estimated price tag of $1.3 billion in 1998 to more than $9 billion by September 2020, according to the Government Accountability Office . It’s not clear how much refitting the Zumwalt class vessels to fire IRCPS, or other potential upgrades, such as new radars , might add to this price point. The decision to add only a relatively limited number of IRCPS missiles, which would be intended for use against very high-value targets, rather than more traditional VLS cells to the DDG-1000s, could add to an ongoing debate about the Navy’s overall conventional missile-launching capacity. It has been noted that the service’s fleet structure plans, which remain in flux , generally involve retiring ships and submarines with significant numbers of VLS cells. This is particularly true of the Navy’s desire to divest a significant portion of its Ticonderoga class cruisers and the expected retirement of the four Ohio class guided-missile submarines . The service has said it plans to acquire new large surface warships and so-called “ large payload submarines ,” as well as a fleet of large-displacement unmanned surface vessels (USV), which could have their own missile magazines . However, any new classes of large surface combatants or missile-carrying submarines are still years away from becoming a reality and Congress has expressed skepticism about plans for large USVs. There has also been some discussion about the potential for increasing the missile-carrying capacity of the Navy’s future Constellation class frigates . Before it selected a design, the service did change its requirements for those ships, increasing the number of VLS cells each one had to have from 16 to 32. In 2019, the Navy said it could add between $16 and $24 million to each one, and potentially cause delays in delivery, to add another 16 VLS cells to any of the competing designs . As The War Zone has reported , the Constellation class design the service eventually selected is longer, wider, and displaces substantially more than the ship it was based on, the Italian subvariant of the Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate. This is in part to allow for “future growth,” which might raise a possibility that space has been built in to allow for the addition of new missile-launching capacity as time goes on. At the same time, the Navy has talked about adding other capabilities to these ships, including directed energy weapons. “For the Navy, we know that’s a distributed maritime operations concept that is driving a smaller, more distributed fleet [with fewer] large vessels, and more lethal, smaller vessel. That means frigates. So we should have that debate over whether we should put that next dollar into a 33-year-old cruiser, or whether we should invest in the Flight III [ Arleigh Burke class ] DDG,” Chief of Naval Operations Gilday said back in April . “We can’t just be counting VLS tubes and satisfying ourselves that that’s the sole metric we’re going to look at.” The Navy has clearly decided that arming its DDG-1000s with IRCPS missiles in the coming years is an important part of that overall plan to increase the lethality of its fleets.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 6, 2021",Hundreds Of South Korean And U.S. Warplanes Are Conducting A Secretive Exercise In Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid a simmering ‘missile race’ on the Korean peninsula, South Korea and the United States are running a large-scale air exercise in the region, with around 200 aircraft reportedly involved. The maneuvers represent a return to the large-scale collaboration of this kind between the two nations that was scaled back dramatically as Washington attempted to negotiate with North Korea about its nuclear weapons program . However, with more recent hopes that Pyongyang might resume talks, the current exercise is being run without any media fanfare. North Korea, for its part, has traditionally complained about these kinds of exercises, whatever the scale. The drills, the name of which is unknown, began yesterday, according to a South Korea official, talking anonymously to the Yonhap news agency. In a statement to the agency, the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) said: “We cannot comment on the exercise as it is one that is not disclosed to the media.” The U.S. military has so far not released any information either. U.S. Air Force F-16s taxi out for an elephant walk during Exercise Vigilant Ace at Osan Air Base, South Korea, in Dec. 2017., U.S. AIR FORCE Reports suggest the maneuvers will last for five days and involve ROKAF F-15Ks and F-16s alongside U.S. Air Force F-16s, among a total of around 200 aircraft involved, but that no equipment or troops have been deployed from the U.S. mainland to take part. The permanent U.S. Air Force combat aircraft presence in South Korea is based around two fighter wings, the 8th Fighter Wing at Kunsan Air Base, with two squadrons of Block 40 F-16C/Ds, and the 51st Fighter Wing at Osan Air Base, with one squadron each of F-16C/Ds and A-10Cs. Other assets include a squadron that operates U-2S spy planes and a detachment of HH-60G combat rescue helicopters. A ROKAF F-15K Slam Eagle lands at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, in November 2014., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Divine Cox In the past, these regular exercises were run under the nickname Vigilant Ace and were the largest joint air training maneuvers between South Korea and the United States; they also had a notably high profile in the media. Typical missions practiced include air defense, long-range strike, air infiltration, and close air support of ground forces. In Dec. 2017, for example, more than 230 military aircraft and 12,000 personnel were involved. U.S. Air Force F-22 and F-35A stealth fighters deployed to Gwangju Air Base in South Korea from Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska and Kadena Air Base in Japan, respectively, drawing protests from Pyongyang. A USAF B-1B bomber out of Andersen Air Force Base , Guam, also flew over the peninsula during the same maneuvers, in what was seen as a show of force to the regime in Pyongyang. A U.S. Air Force B-1B, deployed to Andersen Air Base, Guam, is flanked by two F-15K Slam Eagles, assigned to Daegu Air Base, South Korea, during a flight over South Korea in September 2016., ROKAF/Chief Master Sgt. Kim, Kyeong Ryul The following year, the scheduled Vigilant Ace in late 2018 was suspended , in a move approved by then-U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his opposite number Jeong Kyeong-doo of South Korea. This was the sixth allied exercise to be canned since the June summit meeting in Singapore between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in which Washington had aimed to put a stop to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs in return for the U.S. easing sanctions. North Korea has long seen these kinds of joint military maneuvers as provocative and has described them as pretexts for attacks to be launched against it, even calling for their cancellation as a condition to continued negotiations. The Pentagon hoped that the cancellation of Vigilant Ace in 2018 would “give the diplomatic process every opportunity to continue,” according to a statement ahead of a second meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un. That summit was eventually held in Hanoi in February 2019, but collapsed acrimoniously . A 13th Fighter Squadron F-16 pilot steps from her jet prior to a Vigilant Ace exercise at Osan Air Base, South Korea, in November 2017. , U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Deana Heitzman Since then, relations between North and South Korea have worsened, with both engaged in the rapid development of new missile technologies focused on adding to their strategic capabilities. Although Vigilant Ace seems to have been officially omitted from the exercise calendar since 2018, these kinds of collaborations between the two air arms have continued, on a smaller scale and with different labels. In April 2019, the large-scale Max Thunder exercise involving South Korea, the United States, and Australia was replaced with a scaled-down exercise , described as a Combined Flying Training Event and the same nomenclature was used later the same year for another training event that replaced Vigilant Ace . A U.S. Air Force F-16 from the 36th Fighter Squadron, Osan Air Base, South Korea, takes off during Exercise Max Thunder at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, in April 2017., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Colville McFee In December 2020 there was another Vigilant Ace-style exercise, but involving a somewhat reduced participation list , with around 150 aircraft, of which some 90 were provided by the ROKAF. Again, the maneuvers were not disclosed to the public and the smaller size was attributed to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In August this year, another round of exercises between South Korea and the United States saw Pyongyang refusing to answer routine calls on its hotline with Seoul, and Kim Jong Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong accused the South of “ perfidious behavior .” For its part, the U.S. State Department said that the exercise was “purely defensive in nature” and Washington “harbors no hostile intent towards” North Korea. Kim Yo Jong sits with South Korean President Moon Jae In during the Winter Olympics in 2018., AP Clearly, while the United States is continuing to conduct military drills with South Korea, these are being run in a much more low-key manner, presumably amid hopes in the Biden administration that talks with the North can be restarted. In October, the U.S. envoy for North Korea condemned recent ballistic missile tests but said the United States was committed to exploring “sustained and substantive diplomacy” with North Korea. So far, however, Pyongyang has not been receptive and has continued to complain vociferously about military exercises in the South, no matter what size they are and their public profile. Ballistic missiles launched using a railway-based system are among the new weapons developments unveiled by North Korea in recent months., NORTH KOREAN STATE MEDIA Currently, it seems that Pyongyang is unwilling to engage with the United States and drop its ongoing missile development programs, which have only accelerated in recent months, setting a potentially dangerous precedent and bringing new variables to the standoff on the peninsula. These have included, at last count, a new submarine-launched ballistic missile , a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle missile system, a railcar-based missile launcher , and a ground-launched cruise missile . At the same time, as long as South Korea continues its own missile efforts , then the North will likely still point to what it sees as “ double standards .” For South Korea, moreover, there has also been an increasing focus on military independence and self-sufficiency , including a renewed push to break South Korea fully away from the United States in terms of control of the military during the tenure of President Moon Jae In, which will end next year. Traditionally, an agreement with the United States means that the South Korean military would operate entirely under U.S. military control during an actual conflict on the peninsula. It is questionable whether running exercises under what’s essentially a media blackout will be an effective way of allaying the North’s skepticism over its adversaries’ intentions. On the other hand, it’s clear that, after several years of toned-down drills, the U.S. and Republic of Korea Air Forces are once again staging drills involving hundreds of planes.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 16, 2021",Secret RQ-180 Stealthy Unmanned Spy Plane Spotted Over Area 51,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A year after the apparent first sighting of what is very likely to be the Air Force’s so-called ‘ RQ-180’ very stealthy flying-wing surveillance aircraft above the Mojave Desert, what looks like the very same aircraft has now been photographed over Area 51 , the clandestine flight test center deep within the Nevada Test and Training Range . While we still don’t know for absolute certain the details surrounding this craft, or even its official designation, the latest appearance follows a previous sighting over the Philippines in September that The War Zone was first to report and suggests perhaps that the secret drone is now edging toward a more operational, and possibly even less clandestine, status. The latest photo of the purported RQ-180, which has all the hallmarks of a high-altitude, long-endurance type with obvious stealthy characteristics, was posted on October 31 by our friends over at the Dreamlandresort.com website, maintained by Joerg Arnu. He was on the scene and described how the sighting unfolded: “A friend who wishes to remain anonymous and I were at the Groom Lake Road gate yesterday. I heard a faint aircraft noise and noticed a contrail straight above us, inside the Area 51 restricted airspace, heading roughly SSW. Through my IS [image stabalized] binoculars, I first thought I was looking at a B-2 until I realized it had a POINTED tail. The B-2 has a serrated tail. My friend took the enclosed photo (two enhanced versions superimposed). It is clearly a twin-engine aircraft.” Arnu added that the photo was taken with a Canon 20Mpix camera with a 1,600-mm equivalent focal length, and he subsequently estimated that the drone was flying at around 70,000 ft. Of course, that is speculative, as we have little idea about the true dimensions of the craft. It is rumored to have a wingspan of around 120 feet, but that remains totally unverified. The aircraft was leaving two telltale contrails behind it, indicative of a closely-set twin-engine arrangement, exactly as we have seen it before. The shape is also a perfect match, with slender wings and a diamond-like center fuselage area, very much like those of Northrop’s original high-flying Advanced Technology Bomber design and the upcoming B-21 Raider. You can read more about how this configuration is something of a ‘back-to-the-future’ moment for the USAF and Northrop Grumman in this past feature of ours. The latest sighting of the apparent RQ-180, spotted over Area 51 on October 30., DREAMLANDRESORT.COM Joerg thinks the direction of the aircraft was headed suggests it may be operating out of Edwards Air Force Base in California, where we believe that at least some of the RQ-180 operations have migrated , and it may have been making use of some of the capabilities at the clandestine flight test facility located at Area 51 , also known as Groom Lake. The secretive base’s DYCOMS facility has the ability to measure the radar signatures of stealthy aircraft in flight for testing and verification purposes. This facility would be a regular waypoint for the RQ-180, including possibly before and after heading out on long-endurance missions. While Arnu and his associate were watching the RQ-180, a truck hauling an apparent Soviet-era Spoon Rest air-defense early-warning radar emerged from one of the Groom gates and apparently waited at a distance for the pair to leave. While it is unlikely that the radar’s movement was in any way related, it’s interesting, at least, that this activity was taking place at the same time, especially on a Saturday, when the ranges are traditionally quieter. All types of foreign threat sensors and air defense systems are used for development and training purposes out at the NTTR. A truck that emerged from Groom Lake with an apparent Soviet-made radar system onboard, while the RQ-180 made its appearance overhead., DREAMLANDRESORT.COM Whether coincidental or not, it was in October last year that we got our first look at what seems to be the RQ-180. On that occasion, the drone was sighted north of Edwards Air Force Base. More recently, in September this year , what appeared to be the so-called RQ-180, or another aircraft with nearly exactly the same planform, was sighted over the Philippines, suggesting that the drone is now in very limited operational service, or at least very advanced real-world testing, while its development continues. Michael Fugint’s September photograph that appears to show the RQ-180 over the Philippines., MICHAEL FUGNIT In all three cases, the drone was flying during the daytime, which may seem odd for an asset that is still so secretive. Then again, we are talking about an aircraft that can fly for dozens of hours, so it won’t really have a choice with regard to flying during the day or not, but mission planning can help alleviate some risk in that regard. As such, daytime movements are likely fundamental to its planned persistent operations and, as we have suggested in the past , the unusual light color scheme could even have been applied specifically to optimize the aircraft’s visual signature for high-altitude operations in daylight hours. In addition, in the Phillippines case, it was seen crossing the coast heading east out into the open Pacific at sunrise. In this recent case, it was over highly surveilled and controlled airspace that has incredibly sparse population density below. The area north of Edwards AFB is also thinly populated and a major aerospace testing area for that reason. A notional RQ-180 concept rendering prepared for The War Zone . , HANGAR B PRODUCTIONS Putting the growing photographic evidence together from multiple sources leaves little question that we really are dealing with a classified, high-flying drone, the existence of which we have long discussed , but now there can no longer be any doubt that this specific configuration is indeed a reality. Now is this the ‘RQ-180’? We really don’t know for sure, but it fits perfectly with the rumored configuration of that aircraft and publicly available design studies that would have informed its design. It’s also possible that the U.S. Air Force has multiple high-altitude, long-endurance, very low-observable platforms under development. As we have discussed in-depth , there are plenty of things a notional RQ-180 could do beyond surveillance, yet using a common platform for multiple mission sets would be far more logical. The places where it has been photographed also make all too much sense — near Edwards AFB, over Area 51, and in what is very likely to be one of its primary operating environments, right between the Phillippine and South China Seas. We also have those very peculiar high-altitude corridors leading from the Air Force’s primary testing areas in Nevada and California and heading out to the greater Pacific. Still, even with this mysterious aircraft popping up in the most logical of places and photos of it having been in circulation for over a year, when exactly the Air Force will confirm its existence is a total unknown. It could be tomorrow or years from now. But considering how important this aircraft is likely to be to the service’s future air-combat architecture, we will probably be hearing about it sooner rather than later.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",What Looks Like The Tail Of A Global Hawk Clone Just Appeared On A Truck In Iran,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Photos that have emerged from Iran apparently show components bearing at least a broad visual similarity to the RQ-4 Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance spy drone. A U.S. Navy RQ-4 was shot down by Iranian air defense s over the Strait of Hormuz in 2019. While the parts seen in the images are certainly reminiscent of the Global Hawk’s empennage in some respects, there is no guarantee that’s what they actually are. However, Iran does have a history of producing its own drones that are very loosely based on U.S. drone designs, including unmanned aerial vehicles supposedly derived from the RQ-170 stealth drone , one of which fell into its hands in 2011 , as well as another that seems to be heavily inspired by the MQ-1 Predator . They have emulated others from manufacturers around the globe and even built drones out of U.S. manned jet designs. The images in question first came to our attention yesterday and show what could be the rear fuselage portion of a Global Hawk-style drone, complete with outward-angled vertical tail fins, transported on a flatbed truck on an Iranian highway somewhere near Tehran. Providing that the photos are indeed legitimate, the shape of the possible drone component is partially concealed by tarpaulins. There is no sign of the engine that would normally be found between the tail fins, but that is likely a separate structural component. The fins themselves, which include movable rudders, are more vertically oriented than those on the RQ-4 but may have been arranged in this way for road transport. Furthermore, they also appear shorter than those on the Global Hawk. A flat ‘boat tail’ between the vertical tails is also visible, which is very similar to the one found on the Global Hawk and its derivatives. Otherwise, the drone-like payload on the truck is painted white, with a prominent black and red flash on the visible outer surface of the fin. All in all, the possible clone of the rear portion of a Global Hawk is a mystery. It’s not even clear that the object is RQ-4-derived or even an unmanned vehicle, although the fins at the rear would really suggest this. A U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk is prepared for a mission while deployed at an airbase in Southwest Asia., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Andy M. Kin It’s possible, too, that this is a mockup of a Global Hawk intended for public display as part of an exhibit, or a military parade, which would echo previous Iranian efforts that have yielded a supposed “stealth fighter” as well as a miniaturized American aircraft carrier , both intended primarily for propaganda purposes. It’s conceivable that a full-size model of a Global Hawk could serve as the centerpiece of an exhibit commemorating the shootdown of one of these drones on June 20, 2019. On that date, a U.S. Navy RQ-4N BAMS-D (Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator) was brought down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, an episode you can read all about here . The drone had previously entered Iranian airspace near the Kouhmobarak district in Hormozgan province, according to Iran’s IRNA news agency. Official U.S. accounts, meanwhile, said that the BAMS-D was flying at “high altitude” and was around 21 miles from the Iranian coast at the time of the attack and that it fell into international waters. One of the Navy’s BAMS-D aircraft, of the version that was shot down by Iran in 2019., U.S. Navy Having recovered most of the wreckage of the BAMS-D from the waters off Iran, it’s not inconceivable that the country’s scrappy aerospace industry could have produced an airworthy or even just a taxi-able crude clone of the American drone. Some have posited this possibility in the past , although apparently without any confirmation from Iranian or other official sources. Once retrieved, the BAMS-D wreckage was revealed to the media, as seen in the following images: Building a knockoff version of the RQ-4 that comes anywhere close to replicating the same capabilities as the original would certainly be a huge challenge. In this regard, drones in the class of the Kaman-22 — the Iranian UAV that’s apparently based on the MQ-1 Predator — combined with some features of the more advanced MQ-9 Reaper , are much more realistic in terms of development and production. Notably, the Kaman-22 also appeared several years after Iran showed an example of what was apparently a captured U.S. military Predator. Still, maybe a lower, shorter, and slower flying, smaller, and far less capable take on the Global Hawk could be within Tehran’s reach. Having a long-endurance drone adapted for medium-to-high-altitude maritime surveillance could be beneficial for Tehran, beyond it being a traditional propaganda win. The Kaman-22, which Iran claimed was “in the final stages of production” earlier this year., VIA TWITTER The Navy’s loss of an RQ-4N in 2019 was a serious propaganda coup for Iran, as well as a potential flashpoint in what was a significant period of tensions between Washington and Tehran. It would not be entirely surprising to now see Iran try and further capitalize on the success of this high-profile event. While Iran has made copies of various items of military equipment in the past, including drones that share general configurations with captured designs, until we see more of this latest shape, we should probably reserve judgment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2021","USS Connecticut Smashed Into A Seamount, May Have Ripped Off Sonar Dome","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. USNI News has reported that the U.S. Navy has concluded the Seawolf class nuclear fast-attack submarine USS Connecticut struck an “uncharted seamount” last month, an accident that has left it stricken pierside in Guam . This comes as what appears to be the first official picture of any kind showing the submarine in Guam has emerged. Though this view of Connecticut is limited, it makes clear that the collision did not impact its sail, but questions remain about the state of the submarine’s bow, including the dome over its main sonar array and its hull below the waterline. Navy Vice Adm. Karl Thomas, head of U.S. 7th Fleet, which has its forward-deployed headquarters in Japan, will now determine what disciplinary action might be taken as a result of the accident, which occurred on Oct. 2, reportedly in the South China Sea, according to USNI News . A previous report from the same outlet said that Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC), was conducting its own investigation into the incident, and it is unclear what the status of that review is at present. The Navy still remains tight-lipped about the actual extent of the damage to Connecticut and how it plans to execute any necessary repairs. Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, left, talks on the deck of the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land with Navy Capt. Andrew Ring, at right, who is the commanding officer of that ship, on Oct. 30, 2021 . The USS Connecticut is visible in the background to the right . , USN Thanks to a picture, seen above and dated Oct. 30, 2021, of Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro being given a tour of the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land , we have now been given our first on-the-ground look at Connecticut. It’s not entirely clear when Secretary Del Toro first touched down on the island or if he is still there. The Navy had announced on Oct. 21 that he would be making a tour of the Indo-Pacific region, with stops in Guam, as well as Hawaii, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Papua New Guinea. The ostensible goals of the secretary’s travel in the region are “to discuss the importance of international defense partnerships, and reinforce the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region” and to visit shore and afloat commands to better understand quality of life, and vital mission sets unique to the area of operation.” Del Toro’s visit to Guam is not surprising in the slightest given the island’s immensely strategic position in the Western Pacific. It makes good sense that that the secretary would want to get a firsthand look and the latest update about the status of Connecticut , which is one of the Navy’s most prized assets , while he was there. The portions of the submarine that are visible in this new picture, a crop of which is seen below, do not show any obvious damage. Lines of some kind are seen snaking into the boat via the top of the sail and small structures have been erected over multiple points on top of the hull. USN Though this view of Connecticut is limited, it does effectively confirm that the collision did not impact the sail, which would make sense if the boat ran into a seamount. The War Zone had previously assessed that the sail had likely escaped largely unscathed based on satellite imagery from Planet Labs that we obtained and published last month, which provided the first real public look at the submarine since the accident. There is still no way to tell for certain how significantly the bow or the underside of the boat may be damaged. A satellite image, dated Oct. 20, showing USS Connecticut in Guam., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION That same satellite imagery, dated Oct. 20, showed the Emory S. Land moored next to what appeared to be an improved Los Angeles class (688i) nuclear attack submarine in a different portion of Guam’s Apra Harbor. More recent satellite imagery that The War Zone has reviewed shows that, at least by Oct. 25, the submarine tender had moved across the harbor to be near Connecticut . Satellite images of Connecticut in Guam do still continue to raise questions about potentially serious damage to the submarine’s bow, especially to the powerful sonar array inside it. Last week, retired Navy submariner Aaron Amick, a contributor to The War Zone , posted a video on his Sub Brief YouTube channel, seen in full below, where, upon closer inspection, he assessed that the “the [bow] sonar dome is completely gone” and noting the submerged array itself is visible in the Oct. 20 image. Amick said this aligned with the information he had recently received from sources on Guam, who had told him that the dome was ripped off in the collision. Another satellite image of Apra Harbor that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, dated Oct. 25, could be interpreted to show the bow dome missing, but this could also be a trick of the light. Another shot, taken two days later, offers a view of the bow that is essentially similar to what was seen on Oct. 20. This satellite image of USS Connecticut in Guam, dated Oct. 25, appears to show the entire bow of the submarine missing, but this is a trick of the light., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A satellite image taken on Oct. 27 of USS Connecticut in Guam again shows what could be the submarine’s exposed bow sonar array submerged at the front.

Land. , PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The main section of the bow sonar array on the Seawolf class submarines is a big sphere, which could match what we are seeing in the Oct. 20 and Oct. 27 imagery. How the array is installed on the submarine does make things potentially confusing since the general shape of the submarine’s bow would still be visible even if the dome was missing, whether it was torn off in the collision or removed as part of the damage assessment process after the boat arrived in Guam. Regardless, if the array itself is indeed visible, this could indicate that the front of the submarine was not seriously crushed in the accident, as has happened to other submarines that have hit seamounts or other parts of the ocean floor in the past. A close-up of the Oct. 27 satellite image, with an arrow pointing to the bow where the exposed sonar array may be visible., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A briefing slide showing the entire bow sonar array assembly found on the Navy’s Seawolf class submarines., PENN STATE NAVY ROTC PRESENTATION SLIDE USNI News also reported last week that the collision caused damage to the submarine’s forward ballast tanks, which forced it to sail all the way from the accident site to Guam on the surface. If true, this would have put the boat in a very vulnerable position and made it much easier for opponents, such as China, to track its movement. The Chinese government continues to make unsubstantiated allegations of a coverup regarding the incident, voicing particular concerns about the potential for radiation leaks, something the Pentagon has categorically denied . Depending on the full extent of the damage, it is very possible that Emory S. Land , even with the assistance of teams from elsewhere within the Navy, will not be able to make the necessary repairs to Connecticut in Guam. As recently as last week, the service said the initial damage assessment was still ongoing in a statement to USNI News . From what we can see in the satellite imagery, together with other information that continues to emerge, it seems increasingly likely that the boat will have to be brought to another location for more extensive work since Guam does not have a large dry dock. Pearl Harbor in Hawaii would be the most obvious choice of a place to conduct more extensive repairs, but it could take significant effort to get Connecticut there, especially if its present seaworthiness is at all in question. A semi-submersible heavy-lift ship, of the kind that has been used to move other Navy vessels involved in major accidents in the past, could be required to get the submarine out of Guam. With only a trio Seawolf class submarines in service — only three were ever built — it continues to be highly likely that the Navy will feel compelled to get Connecticut fixed, regardless of the cost and time it might take to do so. These are highly advanced submarines that provide unique capabilities widely understood to be optimized for intelligence-gathering activities , among other specialized missions. The third and final Seawolf , the USS Jimmy Carter , is actually the lone example of a distinct subclass with a 100-foot long Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) hull extension and other modifications that allow it to perform underwater espionage operations, as you can read more about here . The USS Connecticut , one of only three Seawolf class submarines ever built., USN At the same time, this reality has raised questions about potential cascading issues with regard to available space for repairs in Navy-owned shipyards . For years now, the service has been struggling to eliminate maintenance backlogs in public shipyards that have led to significant delays in getting submarines and surface ships back to the fleet. “Right now, it’s [ Connecticut ] in Guam, that’s public record, there is no dry dock in Guam, hopefully a sub tender can do the work, but that remains to be seen,” Jay Stefany, the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Navy for research, development, and acquisition, told members of Congress during a hearing last week. “It just shows how … the world gets a vote and things change and unexpected incidents create more demand for repairs. … The attack subs have always been the poor cousin in the public shipyards in terms of getting priority, but we know particularly a Seawolf class submarine is extremely valuable in terms of the mission in that part of the world.” For now, at least, Connecticut continues to sit pierside in Guam, as the Navy keeps working to determine what steps it will need to take next.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Nov 1, 2021",Inside The Navy’s Top Aggressor Squadron That Is About To Trade Its Hornets For Super Hornets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Navy’s dedicated adversary squadrons, VFC-12, the “Fighting Omars,” is about to get a massive increase in capability as it trades its “Legacy” F/A-18A+ and C/D model Hornets for early examples of the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The War Zone can exclusively reveal that the squadron is expected to make the transition by October 2021. It marks the latest phase in the Navy’s divestment of original F/A-18A-D variants of the Hornet and the Fighting Omars will be the first Navy aggressor squadron to be fully equipped with the type. The inclusion of early-batch Super Hornets in VFC-12’s adversary mission will alleviate the increasing burden of maintaining older Hornets, many of which have extremely high flight hours, plus it will add some notable enhancements to meet increasing demands for more robust ‘bandit’ threat training. It follows news that the U.S. Air Force is to similarly enhance its aggressor capabilities by using early examples of the F-35A and younger F-16C/Ds to equip the 65th Aggressor Squadron . “We’re hoping that the daily availability of the Super Hornets will make it easier for everyone on the squadron to keep their flight hours up,” says VFC-12’s Lieutenant Commander Ian “Bro” Hutter. “The Super Hornet also carries more fuel, so it can stay airborne longer, which will also reduce the burden in terms of the actual number of sorties we have to fly,” he adds. VFC-12, which is home-based at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, and uses the radio callsign and nickname “Ambush,” looks set to receive some of the oldest Super Hornets previously in use by the fleet. These are examples that were originally assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 27 “Royal Maces” since 2004. This unit, assigned to Carrier Air Wing Five in Japan, swapped its original Block I F/A-18Es for new Block II examples. Super Hornets will herald a welcome boost in the way the Fighting Omars fly their critical fleet support missions. It’s not currently clear if the jets destined for VFC-12 will be modified under the Boeing Service Life Modernization life extension program, which you can read more about here . VFC-12 received F/A-18Cs in recent years to replace its F/A-18A+ Hornets., U.S. Navy Transitioning VFC-12 to the Super Hornet is the latest in a succession of moves by the U.S. Navy to remove the 1980s-era Legacy Hornets from its inventory . It also reflects a need to evolve adversary technology and employ more advanced training techniques to meet growing threats abroad. While the Marine Corps continues to operate the Hornet, original A-D models have all been retired from the front line Navy units, and the Blue Angels flight demonstration team is also now receiving Super Hornets , as well. Along with VFC-12, the “River Rattlers” of VFA-204, the U.S. Naval Test Pilot’s School (TPS), and the Naval Fighter Weapons School, better known as Topgun , are the only remaining Navy units that still fly the Legacy Hornet. “Legacy” Hornet, modern mission Lieutenant Commander Hutter spoke to The War Zone while deployed for a month with VFC-12 to Naval Air Station Key West, in Florida, supporting unit-level work-ups for fleet Super Hornet squadrons under the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program, known as SFARP. One of the Fighting Omars’ main taskings is to provide high-end red air adversary threat presentations to fleet aviators in order to help them prepare for combat deployments. “SFARP typically involves two fleet squadrons coming here for two weeks. They then leave and another two new squadrons rotate in here,” Hutter explains. SFARP is an initial phase in deployment work up preparations for Carrier Air Wing (CVW) strike fighter squadrons. “If you break down our level of priorities at VFC-12, the highest would be what we call core events, which are related to the Optimized Fleet Response Plan [OFRP]. This starts about a year before a carrier air wing deploys. The first step of this is SFARP, which is squadron-level tactics, and is what we primarily support,” Hutter explains. “Squadrons typically conduct these events at Key West for air-to-air SFARP, and NAS Fallon for air-to-surface phases. VFC-12 provides threat aircraft presentations to give the fleet pilots a credible adversary to contend with during these periods.” Super Hornets detached to Boca Chica Field, NAS Key West, during SFARP., U.S. Navy/MCS2C Brian Morales “We also support COMPTUEX [Composite Training Unit Exercises] in the latter part of the work-up, right as the units get ready to deploy on the carrier as an air wing. This typically means we deploy to NAS Jacksonville, Florida, for the East Coast, or to NAS North Island, California, for the West Coast. So we have four main detachment locations for us. SFARP and COMPTUEX trump everything else — if there’s a requirement for us to support either of those, we will drop everything and go.” Next down the priority list is a relatively new mission known as Legacy Transition Training, or LTT. “We started this last year,” says Hutter, explaining how LTT is a training role the squadron picked up to convert existing aviators to fly the Legacy Hornet after the designated Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS),  VFA-106, the “Gladiators,” ceased flying training for Hornets in October 2019. VFC-12 now supports the pilot and maintainer training requirement to supply the handful of units in the Navy that still operate the F/A-18A-D. “It’s going to be relatively short-lived, because we are scheduled to be transition-complete to the Super Hornet this time next year [November 2021],” says Hutter. “LTT is for staff instructors going to fly the C/D at Topgun, at VFA-204, or at TPS. We do their training and last year we had over 50 people come through for the five hours of flying training to get the ‘charlie qual.’” The Omars also provide red air training for the Oceana-based units in what the squadron refers to as “fleet support” — but Hutter acknowledges this third tier responsibility is, unfortunately, on an as-available basis due to the myriad of more pressing demands. VFC-12 provides “fleet support” for home-based training from NAS Oceana when schedules allow., Jamie Hunter Skilled hands Like VFC-13, the “Fighting Saints,” at NAS Fallon, and VFC-111, the “Sundowners,” at NAS Key West, both of which fly the F-5N/F Tiger II , and aforementioned River Rattlers at Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, Louisiana, VFC-12 is part of the Tactical Support Wing (TSW), a wing belonging to the Naval Reserves. The U.S. Navy closed down its active-duty adversary squadrons in the mid-1990s, and in doing so (aside from Topgun instructors), it handed responsibility for red air over to the Reserves. Hutter is the only Weapons Systems Officer (WSO) currently on staff at VFC-12 and, like most of the aircrew here, he is a highly experienced Topgun graduate. “Everyone here is technically a full-time reservist. Our current Skipper is full-time support staff, we also have four full-time support department heads. As far as pilots go, the rest are Selected Reservists [ SELRES ].” This means they have regular jobs away from the squadron, but provide a certain number of days per month. VFC-12’s maintainers are all U.S. Navy sailors, a mix of active-duty, full-time support, or the more traditional reservists, unlike the two F-5 squadrons, which have their maintenance undertaken by contractors. An F-5N of VFC-111 “Sundowners.”, U.S. Navy/Danette Baso Silvers “The great thing about VFC-12 is that we get to hand pick our staff for the most part. All our SELRES pilots are Topgun graduates with the blue patch. Probably 80% of our guys have gone through that syllabus and the experience here provides the ability to quickly transition between missions — to lead a flight at the last minute. Everyone in the squadron is of a very high caliber, and the importance of having that network of people, who can coordinate pretty much anything, cannot be overstated.” The coveted blue patch is awarded to students who complete the main Topgun course , which is dedicated to friendly (Blue Air) tactics. Topgun also oversees a Navy adversary course that results in a graduate being awarded a red Topgun adversary patch. “In order to lead a core OFRP event, you have to be a Level 4 adversary,” explains Hutter. Individuals who graduate from the Topgun red air course are designated as a Level 5 adversary, the highest standard, and a training officer can then train Level 4 adversaries at the respective VFC units. The red Topgun adversary patch., Jamie Hunter Hutter elaborates that Level 4 is essentially an adversary mission commander. “It means you can provide a high-quality threat representation and meet fighter training objectives in threat simulation. It also means that you are able to manage a lot of airplanes in the airspace.” “VFC-12/13/111 and VFA-204 all send pilots through the red class at Topgun, then they come back to the squadron as training officers and qualify us. We have constant discussions with Topgun and we fight based on how they assess current threat capabilities. For VFC-12 specifically, our work is all about that high-end threat replication. When the fleet squadrons need a more benign ‘radar reflector’ for beyond visual range type engagements, they tend to use the F-5s. Those guys also support the FRS training units, but we typically don’t.” “SFARP is managed by both the East and West Coast Strike Fighter Weapons Schools and it is designed to offer the most challenging division [4-ship] level fleet tactics. We’re doing that here at Key West right now; four blue air fleet Hornets against up to 20 bandits. There’s no contract red air at this SFARP, but it’s not unheard of for them to be here. As a squadron, we have 11 Hornets here now, and we are flying three ‘gos’ a day.” VFC-12 offers the Navy’s highest level of threat replication, and it’s not just about a generic presentation. “We study threat pilot tactics and how threat nations operate,” says Hutter. “We understand how threat nations of interest operate, this isn’t red air between fellow JOs [Junior Officers]. Our threats are very specific. In SFARP it’s always Russian or Chinese aircraft . It’s not targeted at those countries, but they just have the most capable airplanes. So, it’s targeted at those top tier airframes.” A VFC-12 F/A-18D in “splinter” scheme., Jamie Hunter A changing mission Describing a typical SFARP mission out of NAS Key West, Lieutenant Commander Hutter says: “You take off over the turquoise sea and fly over fishing boats, and do some cloud dodging. We fly in the Whiskey 174 range complex, which essentially runs between Key West and out towards Texas. The bandits flow out to the west, and the fighters start in the east. We need to get anywhere between 8 and 20 adversary aircraft together. Everyone checks in and we start our plan to confuse the fighters. The hardest part is keeping track of who is who.” “We send a pilot to the TCTS [Tactical Combat Training System] range control center and they can work with the Range Training Officers on the radio to help ensure the objectives are met.” Hutter clarifies that the use of a Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) controller very much depends on how much is going on. They are there to provide additional situational awareness on the evolving skirmish. “With the potential of over 20 fighters merging, the range/training safety officers are there to help avoid a collision. The VFC F-5s are now flying with Red Net . This works with the TCTS and, on an iPad in the cockpit, they can now see the whole air picture.” It’s a capability that VFC-12 expects to build upon when it receives its Super Hornets thanks to their Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS).” “We use a standard height block structure [broken down within each 10,000ft block]. The blue air fighters are usually in the 5,000-9,000ft block and the bandits are 0-4,000ft. The higher and faster the shooters fly, the better the kinematics of the missiles. If we are up at 45,000ft and flying at Mach 1.2 indicated airspeed, we present a much harder problem for them. In the more complex exercises like Red Flag , you might hold for 30 minutes, fly towards the Blue guys, get told you’re dead, and never see another jet. The great thing about what we do in our division level tactics is that we can get a lot closer.” VFA-204 “River Rattlers” Hornets taxi out at Key West during an SFARP., U.S. Navy/MCS2C Brian Morales “Merging and getting into a close turning fight very much depends on the mission that we are supporting. The fighters have some missions where their acceptable level of risk is low, so we, therefore, have very few merges. In fact, they will avoid the merge at all costs, preferring to run away. The higher their acceptable level of risk for the mission is, the more merges we will have. We’ll have flights where everybody merges! Typically that’s when there’s a lot of electronic attack out there, a lot of bandits and a lot of fighters. The higher the risk their mission is, the more willingness they have to go to the merge. Unless there are Raptors joining the fight. If Raptors are there, we never get to the merge,” smiles Hutter, emphasizing the U.S. Air Force fighter’s prowess in fighting at long range. “Approaching the merge, if we don’t see the fighters then we will be at the bottom of our block height, and they will be at the top of theirs. That gives us a 1,000ft avoidance. If we see them, and we’re high on situational awareness, we can see everyone visually — all wingmen and tally all the fighters — then we are clear to come out of our block [and start Basic Fighter Maneuvers, BFM, aka dogfighting].” The contract red air providers are not permitted contractually to dogfight with fleet aircraft, and are often limited to level 180 degree turns. “The Navy contract for contract air support does not allow them to BFM,” Hutter confirms. “Red air tactics are so advanced now. As a JO [junior officer] I remember the bandits flew slow, they stayed level, and maneuvered very little. Today, as red air, we are making sure we are as testing to the fighters as possible. It’s definitely not easy to do anymore. We are being asked to give the fighters increasingly robust presentations.” Topgun instructors currently fly a mix of Hornets and Super Hornets in the adversary role., Jamie Hunter New iron As fleet units field increasing capabilities, the Navy adversaries are having to up their game. Currently, the use of simulation and synthetic training has not found its way into the VFC-12 world — it’s all about live flying. “Every day we see contractors working to make simulations better. Until it’s really good, seamless, we aren’t going to use it. In the workups towards SFARP, there is a simulator portion where we sit at the consoles and direct the red air simulation for the fighters. Until the synthetic training is seamless, it can be negative training or a waste of time if it’s not as good as the real thing.” Hutter says VFC-12 has seen some change with the advent of the F-35 Lightning II , but mainly in the realm of security. “There are currently no separate training objectives for the F-35 than there are for the Super Hornet — we test them the same way, but that will change I’m sure. We are here to be threat representative and I don’t think any threat country knows how to truly deal with stealth technology yet, but it takes a long time for feedback to get to us.” Having enjoyed a subtle upgrade by trading some of its F/A-18As for F/A-18C/Ds a couple of years ago as they were handed down from fleet units, Hutter says the move to the Super Hornet will have significant benefits. VFC-12 is expected to receive early Block I F/A-18E/Fs., Jamie Hunter The cost per flight hour of operating just a few units of C/D Hornets is significant, and the Navy wants to remove them from the inventory fast, consolidating on the Super Hornet. This means Topgun is likely to lose its handful of adversary Hornets flown by its instructors, meaning it might receive additional adversary “Rhinos.” In addition, the “River Rattlers” too are set to convert to a new type. Rumors have said this could see the VFA-204 receive secondhand F-16s, but nothing is publicly confirmed. For VFC-12, its “new” jets will be pre-Lot 25 Block I standard Super Hornets. Examples from Lot 25 and beyond are Block II standard aircraft that use high-order language (HOL) software and are equipped with the AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. F/A-18E/Fs prior to Lot 25 use “X-series” software, which mirrors that of the “Legacy” Hornet. Hutter explains that a Super Hornet fleet all equipped with the Block I’s AN/APG-73 mechanically scanned array radar and MIDS will be a huge advantage over the older Hornets. The current VFC-12 Hornets have a mix of AN/APG-65 and -73 radars . “Some of our missions get really complicated, and in our current Hornets we might have low situational awareness. It’s not so much about being as lethal, here it’s also about herding a lot of cats,” says Hutter, who adds that it’s routine for Ambush aircrews to spend too much time being distracted by troubleshooting radar issues, and with no MIDS data link it makes the job of threat presentation work far more difficult while the pilots are busy trying to work out who is who, and where everyone is. VFC-12 will not be the first to use the Super Hornet in the adversary role, with Topgun already operating a handful of early examples. VFC-12 should receive its first “Rhino” in February, with a dozen due to be on the flight line by October as it completes a staggered transition, which will enable it to continue its important mission in the meantime. Proposed VFC-12 schemes designed to represent a Russian Su-57 and a Chinese J-11., U.S. Navy/VFC-12 According to Hutter, the Super Hornets will give “Ambush” aircrews a better ability to detect targets at range, but also they will be harder to detect themselves, due to some of the low observable design features of the Super Hornet. “The Hornet is easier to ‘see’ than a Super Hornet,” he says. There are negatives though. “Seeing a different aircraft at the merge is helpful for fleet aviators. Most squadrons only ever see Super Hornets when they’re fighting.” To make its Super Hornets look like realistic bandits, some remarkable special adversary schemes are being lined up for the new VFC-12 jets by Grant Little. Painting these aircraft differently compared to standard gray fleet jets will be more important than ever to help distinguish the bad guys. With a host of incredible suggested Russian and Chinese liveries on the drawing board, VFC-12 is well placed to retain its position flying some of the coolest-looking jets in the Navy, as well as upping its game to retain its standing as the Navy’s premier adversary squadron. We will be featuring a full set of the proposed VFC-12 Super Hornet schemes as a follow up to this exclusive story very soon. Regardless of how they end up being painted, the Super Hornets will breathe new life into the Fighting Omars and will go a long way when it comes to keeping fleet pilots ready for any potential threats they could encounter while cruising some of the world’s tensest waters. Editor’s note: Updated text to reflect that Grant Little was behind the new aggressor schemes that VFC-12 is applying to its jets. Hat tip to José “Fuji” Ramos for the heads up!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s plans to overhaul its adversary aircraft fleet have taken a significant step forward with the introduction of the first three Super Hornets to Fighter Squadron Composite 12, or VFC-12, which is home-based at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia. Known as the “Fighting Omars,” this unit is one of four specialist adversary units within the Navy with the task of replicating enemy fighters and their tactics. The War Zone was first to reveal plans for VFC-12 to upgrade from the “classic” Hornet to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and subsequently unveiled some of the incredible paint schemes by Grant Little that the unit has planned, which you can see here . VFC-12’s first adversary-painted Super Hornet., VFC-12 Facebook An F/A-18E painted to replicate a Russian Sukhoi Su-57 Felon is the first of the new adversaries to be revealed at the squadron, whose radio callsign in “Ambush.” This scheme is known as “Mako” within VFC-12 circles, and it draws upon a camouflage that first appeared on the fifth production Sukhoi Su-57, and was reportedly known as the “White Shark” scheme in Russia. At least two other Su-57s have also worn this eye-catching finish. The “Mako” F/A-18E was first revealed during a change-of-command ceremony on June 18 at NAS Oceana when CDR Scott “Cawk” Golich assumed command of VFC-12. This particular jet also carries the name of the new CO under its cockpit. VFC-12 has told The War Zone that the next paint job will be the three-tone “Sierra” scheme , one of our favorites that Grant Little cooked up for the squadron, and that the jet should be revealed soon. An Su-57 in the same style paint scheme., UAC In the past, VFC-12 has applied some dazzling schemes to its Hornets, which enables them to look the part as simulated enemy opponents. The schemes tend to be based on camouflage patterns from potential threat nations, but one of the main aims is to simply make them look different to regular gray fleet jets. Fighting dissimilar types is a critical factor in ensuring fleet aircrews are able to meet the challenges of taking on an opponent with unfamiliar flight characteristics. With the majority of the Navy strike fighter fleet being composed of Super Hornet squadrons, making VFC-12’s F/A-18E/Fs look visually different is an important part of their adversary remit. VFC-12 pilots will also be charged with flying them in a manner that replicates enemy procedures, so while the airframes are the same, a fleet aircrew can expect anything but a regular tussle with just another Super Hornet. VFC-12 expects to be “transition complete” from the F/A-18A+ and F/A-18C/D to the Super Hornet by next month, but it won’t receive its full complement of “new” jets until the fall. The “Fighting Omars” are receiving early Block I Super Hornets passed down from fleet units as the first in a series of moves to upgrade and modernize the U.S. Navy’s “in-house” adversary assets that are flown by the Tactical Support Wing (TSW), a wing belonging to the Naval Reserves. VFC-12 becomes the first Navy unit to operate the Super Hornet in the adversary role, although the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (NAWDC) at NAS Fallon, Nevada, already operates them as aggressors for “bandit” threat training. The “Mako” F/A-18E with a newly-arrived F/A-18F alongside., VFC-12 Facebook The Navy plans to remove the “legacy” Hornets from the last adversary unit to operate the type by 2022 in a bid to streamline its overall fleet and retire the high-flight-hour and expensive-to-operate original variants of the Hornet. NAWDC is one of the final operators of the C/D variants, as is VFA-204 “River Rattlers,” another TSW Hornet unit, which is stationed at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base  New Orleans, Louisiana. The retirement presents the Navy with a problem, because the Hornets provide the high-end adversary training required by fleet units and the likes of Topgun. While VFC-12 is receiving Super Hornets, there are insufficient numbers of these fighters available to restock all of the adversary units for the high-end adversary role. Therefore, the Navy is looking to acquire 26 F-16 Vipers from surplus U.S. Air Force stocks. The F-16s appear in the Fiscal Year 2022 budget request and you can read all about the plans here . U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 In a big shake-up of the TSW adversary framework, VFC-13 “Fighting Saints” at NAS Fallon in Nevada will likely receive these F-16C/Ds in order for them to operate them alongside the 15 F-16A/Bs currently attached to the co-located NAWDC , which are primarily flown by Topgun and Strike instructors. In turn, VFC-13’s F-5F/Ns will be moved to join VFA-204 “River Rattlers.” The addition of F-16s within the VFC community adds the all-important aspect of a dissimilar type for fleet pilots to go up against. They will complement Super Hornets in the adversary role, as well as the small number of F-35Cs that have now been assigned to NAWDC. F-16s assigned to NAWDC at NAS Fallon., Jamie Hunter The arrival of Super Hornets on the flightline at the “Fighting Omars” is the first clear sign of the big shake-up in specialist navy adversary units that is now taking place. The “Mako” F/A-18E is the first of what could be a dazzling array of stunningly painted Super Hornets if VFC-12’s plans are anything to go by. As soon as The War Zone gets the heads-up, we’ll be sure to show off the “Sierra” Super Hornet once it is on the line at the “Fighting Omars.” Editor’s note: Updated text to reflect that Grant Little was behind the new aggressor schemes that VFC-12 is applying to its jets.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Nov 1, 2021",These Are The Proposed Paint Schemes For The Navy’s New Adversary Super Hornets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy adversary squadron VFC-12 “Fighting Omars” is upgraded from “Legacy” Hornets to Block I F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, as The War Zone was first to report in this in-depth exclusive feature . The squadron will receive its new fleet of adversary jets next year as part of a major effort to improve adversary red air threat replication training, whilst also marking the last throes of the 1980s-era Hornet in Navy service. VFC-12’s migration to the Super Hornet is a big increase in capability for the squadron, but it means that most Navy fleet pilots will be going head-to-head with the same type as they fly. The benefit of Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) — flying against a different aircraft type — will be lost, at least to some degree. Therefore, making VFC-12’s jets look different—like threats fleet pilots could face on deployment—as well as the adversary pilots flying them differently, will be more important than ever before. Grant Little, on behalf of VFC-12, has drawn-up options for a range of new adversary paint schemes for its new aircraft, some based on generic camouflages, and others specifically designed to replicate Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, and Russian fighters. It represents an exotic mix of schemes that will make VFC-12’s Super Hornets unlike any others. We omitted the same Russian schemes the squadron already has adorned some of its Legacy Hornets with and a couple of standard schemes already found in the aggressor community. Aside from those omissions, here are the options that the elite squadron is considering: U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 U.S. Navy/VFC-12 So there they are, some of the most remarkable adversary red air schemes we’ve ever seen.

Joseph Trevithick and Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Nov 1, 2021",China’s National Insignia Appears On U.S. Navy Adversary F/A-18 Hornet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Fighter Squadron Composite 12 , or VFC-12, also known as the “Fighting Omars,” has released a picture that shows one of the unit’s F/A-18s sporting the national insignia of the Chinese military on the tail rather than a more typical Soviet/Russian-style red star. The unit, which also goes by its callsign, Ambush, is one of four squadrons in the Navy that provide specialized “red air” adversary training support . The War Zone was first to report last year that VFC-12 planned to apply entire new paint schemes mimicking those worn by Chinese jets, among others , to some of its new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, reflecting a U.S. military-wide shift in attention to China as America’s so-called preeminent “pacing threat.” The picture in question, which has no caption, appeared on VFC-12’s official Facebook page yesterday and is one of a series that shows the unit’s senior leaders handing out various awards and commendations. A public affairs officer for the unit told The War Zone that the aircraft in question is an otherwise “vanilla” F/A-18, but it’s not clear if it is one of the squadron’s F/A-18E/Fs or an older “legacy” Hornet. VFC-12’s commanding officer, Commander Scott “Cawk” Golich, at right, hands a sailor a certificate marking their receipt of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. In the background, the Chinese national insignia is visible on the tail of one of the squadron’s F/A-18s., USN That same public affairs officer said that VFC-12’s current plan is to start repainting its jets in the planned new schemes, which will also include ones that are meant to reflect various Russian, North Korean, and Iranian jets as well as Chinese types, in January. In June, the squadron did already debut a Super Hornet wearing a paint job known as the “Mako,” which is meant to mimic a camouflage pattern that first appeared on the fifth pre-production example of Russia’s T-50 advanced combat jet , a design now known as the Su-57 . Last year, VFC-12 provided artwork to The War Zone dreamed-up by Grant Little showing, among others, three different planned paint jobs based on the ones commonly worn by China’s J-10, J-11/J-16, and J-15 fighter jets. The J-10 is an indigenous design, variants of which are in service with the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The J-11, J-15, and J-16, are all derived from the Soviet Su-27 Flanker . While the PLAAF and the PLAN both operate J-11s , the J-15 is a carrier-based type only flown by the PLAN, and the J-16 is a two seat-type only in service with the PLAAF. USN/VFC-12 USN/VFC-12 USN/VFC-12 Of course, it’s no secret that Navy, as well as U.S. Air Force aggressor jets have donned paint schemes representative of potential threats for years. However, when it comes to foreign-inspired paint jobs, a significant number of them have the ones in use by the Soviets, and now the Russian military . Many of those same schemes have been commonly used by other air arms around the world flying Soviet and Russian-made combat jets, as well. During the period around the end of the Cold War, some aggressors commonly wore insignia similar to that of potential threat countries. That practice generally had fallen by the wayside by the 2000s with the red star being something of a blanket insignia for the adversary community. VFA-127’s Hornets and F-5s seen at NAS Fallon during the 1990s. , USN One of VFC-12’s F/A-18s carrying the Chinese national insignia — as the planned, more comprehensive PLAAF and PLAN-inspired schemes — reflects the Pentagon’s current view that China is now America’s “ pacing threat .” This, in turn, means that developments in China are primary drivers of U.S. defense policy, doctrine, and acquisition decision-making across the U.S. military. A VFC-12 Hornet heading out on a mission. , VFC-12 Facebook Page The impact of all of this on VFC-12’s day-to-day activities was already apparent earlier this year at a similar awards event. The squadron’s previous commanding officer, Cdr. Matt Runzel, handed out certificates while wearing an interesting patch, seen below, featuring a Hornet, viewed from the front, on top of a red star, along with “AMBUSH” written at the top. While plain red stars are more typically associated with the Soviet and Russian militaries, the patch also has an unknown phrase in Chinese characters written at the bottom. Cdr. Matt Runzel, at right, then the commanding officer of VFC-12, hands out an award certificate at an event in June., USN A close-up look at Runzel’s patch., USN The Pentagon’s increasing focus on China has also come amid growing concerns within the U.S. government about the potential for an actual conflict with the country, including over Taiwan or in the hotly disputed South China Sea . General geopolitical competition between the two countries is increasing, as well. In particular, recently disclosed Chinese tests of a new nuclear-capable fractional orbital bombardment system that employs a hypersonic glide vehicle earlier this year, which you can read more about here , coupled with other developments , are now raising fears of a new strategic arms race . It’s therefore hardly surprising that the Fighting Omars are already beginning to paint some of their F/A-18s to reflect Chinese combat jets that Navy pilots might increasingly encounter during deployments, even outside of an actual conflict . The squadron’s specially-trained aggressor pilots are all but certainly increasingly trained to mimic the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by the PLAAF and PLAN to further prepare naval aviators for any potential future engagement, as well. With all this in mind, in the coming year, VFC-12 F/A-18s painted like Chinese jets to varying degrees look set to become a more common sight.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the B-1B bombers that had deployed to the remote Indian Ocean outpost of Diego Garcia early this month—the first deployment to the island for the type in over a decade and a half—just flew a unique mission that circumnavigated the Arabian Peninsula. During the long-range sortie, various allies’ fighters joined up with the ‘Bone’ and its accompanying tankers, resulting in the absolutely stunning photos taken by Senior Airman Jerreht Harris seen below. You can read all about the B-1B’s current deployment to Diego Garcia in our past coverage of it here. The “presence patrol” route around the U.S. Central Command’s area of responsibility went as follows, according to the USAF: The flight was a five-hour, non-stop multilateral mission with participation from air forces to include: Bahrain, Egypt, Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. … Multiple partner nations’ fighter aircraft accompanied the B-1B Lancer at different points during the flight, which flew over the Gulf of Aden, Bab el-Mandeb Strait, Red Sea, Suez Canal, Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman before departing the region. Here is a very approximate version of the route the B-1 took. It is also possible that they staged for this particular mission out of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, but the aircraft themselves are bedded-down in Diego Garcia: Google Earth Some of the most interesting images of the set are of the B-1B being escorted by Israeli F-15 Baz fighters.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 15, 2022",Tailless Fighter-Like Airframe Spotted At Chinese Jet Manufacturer’s Test Airfield,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Chengdu Aircraft Corporation is one of two preeminent fighter manufacturers in China, and arguably the best known these days. It has two indigenous fighter designs in production that currently serve with the People’s Liberation Army, the J-10 single-engine mid-weight fighter and the J-20 heavy stealth fighter . The J-20 still arguably stands as China’s most stunning manned aircraft achievement, and the development of it as the country’s first stealth fighter continues to evolve to this very day . Yet that is certain to change in the not-so-distant future as China continues its rapid expansion of air-combat capabilities and manufacturing know-how . Satellite images The War Zone recently obtained — dated Oct. 29, 2021 — of the company’s flight test airfield, which is located adjacent to its plant in its namesake city, is indicative of this. It shows five J-20s on the ramp, 18 J-10s, a couple of drones, and one very unusual airframe unlike any other. The airfield and its surrounding infrastructure, which sits in an urban area, has become somewhat famous for all the ‘leak’-like images and video clips that have emerged from it over the past decade or so depicting Chengdu’s latest and greatest fighter configurations. The facility has also seen immense upgrades and expansion in recent years. Major changes to the primary flightline, and everything from the rapid appearance of a new aircraft display park to new industrial buildings seems to be the norm. In fact, an entirely new industrial area and another large group of hangars with its own flightline are currently under construction on the northwest side of the airfield. Clearly, keeping up with China’s ravenous appetite for combat aircraft is resulting in an aggressive expansion in all directions at the airfield. What a difference nine years makes. The airfield and its surrounding infrastructure in October 2012 and October 2021.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION As to what this thing actually is, we really don’t know. It appears to be a large modified diamond-like delta planform with a relatively thin nose section. The wingspan is roughly that of a J-20, so we are not talking about a small airframe here. The most interesting element is that it is clearly a tailless design. In fact, when I first spotted it, it immediately reminded me of the X-44 Manta concept art from years ago. It turns out, at least to our knowledge, that the X-44 Manta program never came to be. The X-44 we got instead was a small flying-wing technology demonstrator built in-house by Lockheed’s Skunk Works that would serve as a building block for other unmanned flying wing platforms, such as the RQ-170 Sentinel. You can read all about this unique history in these past exclusives of ours . The X-44A Manta would use fuselage and other components from the F-22., Lockheed/NASA Still, we can be relatively confident that at least one — and, more likely, multiple — tailless tactical fighter-like designs were flight tested clandestinely at some point, most likely in the 1990s and 2000s. The advantages of a tailless design are multi-fold, the biggest of which is a major improvement in broadband low-observability against a larger number of radar types operating across a wide range of frequencies. It also better optimizes a stealthy aircraft for reduced radar signature from side and rear perspectives, beyond the head-on aspect. Another feature of this design concept is better efficiency via less drag for sustained high-speed dashes and sustained cruise. With a large modified delta wing, lots of gas can be carried and there is plenty of room for a large internal weapons bay. It also simplifies a design, at least structurally, and reduces weight. The biggest downside is that achieving stability is far more challenging without vertical tails, and maneuverability would be reduced, although this can possibly be offset to some degree through thrust vectoring. Just the possibility of realizing such a design is highly dependent on advanced fly-by-wire digital flight control technology and the software that underpins it. But really, such a design would be more about range, payload, speed, and low observability, not super maneuverability. This is why some of us have begged for such a platform for years, which far better suits America’s potential threat realities and operational hurdles than short-ranged fighters that are optimized to hide from X-band fire-control radars and that trade critical performance capabilities for less relevant maneuverability. These wishes will likely be finally granted in the form of the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) system, and quite possibly the Navy’s similar initiative, too. But even before then, a tailless ‘FB-22’ concept was examined in the mid-2000s, among other potential applications for such a configuration. So, this isn’t actually new, but the concept, paired with advances in digital flight-control systems and manufacturing capabilities, is bubbling up to the top when it comes to what’s next in tactical aviation. Notional NGAD design by Lockheed Martin. Nearly all renders of a next-generation air dominance concept from all U.S. companies and the USAF so far feature tailless designs. , Lockheed Martin An unmanned configuration like this could provide the J-20 with a highly logical, high-performance, and potent ‘loyal wingman’ unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). The USAF has posited very similar designs in its own concept art and China is known to be pursuing other designs for manned-unmanned teaming , as well. Such an aircraft could also be used independently as its own semi-autonomous UCAV, too. Notional loyal wigmen designs presented by the USAF. , USAF If a tailless fighter or UCAV design is indeed the concept reflected in the airframe we are seeing in the satellite images, it doesn’t mean that it is flightworthy. Quite the opposite could be true. It could be a mock-up of a configuration being pursued—or one that was passed over. It could also be a radar cross-section model to test the design’s radar signature . In fact, it looks eerily similar to a radar cross-section test model we have recently seen at an American radar cross-section testing facility. It could also be something else entirely. So, as it sits now, this is an intriguing development, but we will need to see more of this article to truly understand the intent behind it. Still, even if it is a mock-up of some sort, it isn’t surrounded by other mock-ups. Something about it is unique.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 27, 2021",The Navy Just Released Its Vision For Its Future F/A-XX Next Generation Strike Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has provided new details about its vision for a future F/A-XX next-generation strike fighter to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in the 2030s, as well as new art depicting a notional design. The service says it wants these aircraft to fly farther and faster than the existing Super Hornet, have improved sensor capabilities, and be able to employ future longer-range weapons. It also expects the F/A-XX to act as a “quarterback” for groups of unmanned aircraft carrying munitions, equipped with electronic warfare suites, configured as command and control nodes, and more. The new details and artwork related to the F/A-XX program, among other things, were contained within an unclassified document titled “Navy Aviation Vision, 2030–2035,” which the service released this week . F/A-XX dates back to at least 2012 , and it is now part of the Navy’s larger Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) effort. The new F/A-XX artwork, which only shows a top-down view, depicts a design with a broad, almost lambda-wing shape and canard foreplanes. As Aviation Week ‘s defense editor Steve Trimble was quick to point out on Twitter, this notional aircraft may have “ruddervator” tailplanes, similar in broad strokes to the ones found on Northrop’s YF-23 stealth fighter , but that the art is so low resolution that it could also easily have more traditional twin tails. Regardless, there is no indication that this reflects a design that is actually being actively developed, and it is much more likely to be a simple placeholder. It has numerous features that would call into question its stealthy characteristics. Beyond that, it generally seems unlikely the Navy would disclose an actual advanced aircraft design now in development in this kind of unclassified document. Still, it is interesting how markedly different it is from other previous F/A-XX concept art , which has almost universally depicted tailless planforms . An artist’s conception of a notional F/A-XX from Boeing, featuring a tailless design., Boeing As for the jet’s desired capabilities, the Navy says it is still in the process of determining exactly what it wants, but the service did lay out the following general parameters: The F/A-XX is the strike fighter component within the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Family of Systems (FoS). It is planned to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in the 2030s. Its specific capabilities and technologies are under development, however analysis shows it must have longer range and greater speed, incorporate passive and active sensor technology, and possess the capability to employ the longer-range weapons programmed for the future. As the Super Hornets are retired from service, a combination of F-35C and F/A-XX will provide Navy tactical fighter aircraft capability and capacity within the CVW [carrier air wing]. The advanced carrier-based power projection capabilities resident in F/AXX will maintain CVN [aircraft carrier] relevance in advanced threat environments. Most of this makes perfect sense, especially the desire for greater range and speed, which would enable carriers to launch future F/A-XX aircraft at greater distances from their objectives without necessarily increasing the time it takes those jets to arrive on scene. Longer range weapons, including future hypersonic missiles , would only further extend the stand-off reach of these planes. All of this would, in turn, help reduce the vulnerability of the F/A-XX, as well as allow carriers to remain farther away from increasingly more threatening enemy defenses, including anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles . There is likely to be even more interest in greater range now that still largely unknown issues have led to a halt in plans to add conformal fuel tanks to new and upgraded Super Hornets in the Block III configuration , at least for the time being. An F/A-18F Super Hornet test jet fitted with conformal fuel tanks on either side of the top of the central fuselage., USN The Navy’s new aviation vision document also makes clear that the goal is for F/A-XX to be at the center of manned-unmanned teaming capabilities within the service’s future carrier air wings: Along with organic tanking, the MQ-25 will pave the way for unmanned air vehicles on the carrier and manned and unmanned teaming (MUM-T) to extend strike range and enhance maneuverability. As unmanned tanking capacity delivers, the manned tanker requirement decreases, making additional service life and capacity available for strike fighter missions. Continued development of MUM-T will enable information sharing across a distributed force, increasing survivability, reducing risk to manned aircraft, and ensuring weapons capacity. Future unmanned air vehicles with survivable planforms, sensors, and robust autonomy will find, fix, identify, track, engage, and assess land, sea, and air targets. The NGAD FoS will include unmanned platforms with F/A-XX as the quarterback. These manned and unmanned aircraft plus attritable assets will be employed across domains to enable integrated kinetic and non-kinetic fires at tactically relevant ranges. As autonomy and ML [machine learning] efforts mature, the appropriate mix of F/A-XX, manned and unmanned platforms will be evaluated to ensure the most lethal and affordable CVW possible. The separation of “manned and unmanned” from “attritable assets” is interesting given that the latter category has typically been described across the U.S. military as applying exclusively to unmanned systems. Attritable can be hard to define, but it is often described as a low-cost platform designed with a specific and generally relatively short service life in mind, and that is therefore cheap enough to be suitable for higher risk missions where commanders might be more reticent to employ more advanced and costlier designs. There are indications that the Air Force may now be refocusing its understanding of attritable to be more centered on cost, as you can read about here . Affordability is something the Navy has also highlighted here in its discussion about the optimum mix of manned and unmanned aircraft in its future carrier air wings. When it comes to exactly what the F/A-XX will “quarterback,” a graphic included in the aviation vision, seen at the top of this story, shows two air-to-air (“A/A”) drones, armed with air-to-air missiles, as well as one with an electronic warfare (“EW”) package and another command-and-control (“C2”) configured type. Though no further information is provided, the C2 drone is likely understood as one fitted with an advanced communications gateway capable of linking together stealthy aircraft, as F/A-XX is expected to be, and non-stealth ones, as well as various other nodes, including those on the ground and at sea. Otherwise, the Navy’s description of the unmanned platforms it envisions F/A-XXs controlling aligns well with various programs that are publicly known to be ongoing now across the U.S. military. This includes projects focused on developing advanced semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drones that would work directly with manned aircraft, as well as ones exploring fully autonomous networked swarms of both unmanned aircraft and munitions . Many of these efforts are heavily linked to work on artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide greater autonomy, as well. The Navy, specifically, has been directly involved in the development of loyal wingmen and artificial intelligence-driven systems to fly them, as well as the MQ-25 tanker drone , which is already being eyed for other roles . The service is also pursuing an entire revolutionary new electronic warfare ecosystem, dubbed the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS . A graphic depicting concepts the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) explored regarding “networked expendables,” including swarms of drones capable of carrying out electronic attacks and other missions, as part of its System of System Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program. SoSITE is similar, in some respects, to what is known about the Navy’s NEMESIS program, and this graphic also has clear similarities to the F/A-XX one from the Navy’s new aviation vision., DARPA/CSBA The core idea behind NEMESIS, which you can read about more in this past War Zone feature , is to network together electronic warfare capabilities, including on both manned and unmanned platforms, including swarms, ships, and submarines. A key focus of the project is to be able to use that combined capacity to create phantom fleets of aircraft and ships that appear to various enemy sensors, located over great areas, at once. This would theoretically upend an enemy’s decision-making cycle and cause great confusion as to what is actually going on, sucking up critical time and resources and misdirecting their actions. Beyond these coordinated objectives, systems connected under NEMESIS, or a concept like it, would otherwise collaborate to conduct more effective and efficient electronic warfare operations against a highly capable adversary. Overall, as the Navy’s new aviation vision makes clear, the service is still very much in the process of defining exactly what it wants from F/A-XX. At the same time, the core requirements are clearly coming together already and the plans for this next-generation strike fighter will need to get firmer relatively soon if the goal is still to begin replacing Super Hornets with these new aircraft starting in the 2030s. Beyond that, this is pretty much exactly what we have been describing as necessary for years now. So it is good to see some movement towards these concepts, especially when it comes to the widespread introduction of advanced unmanned platforms into the naval air warfare equation, as well as manned carrier-capable platforms with much longer range. Also as we have expressed repeatedly, this system of systems , in which manned platforms with greater range, lower observability (stealthiness), and possibly greater speed, are paired with a family of unmanned combat air vehicles and networked weaponry also likely mirrors what the U.S. Air Force is executing with its own NGAD initiative . In the case of that service, a prototype system is already flying . It’s very possible that the Navy will pursue a similar risk-reduction effort now that its NGAD initiative is picking up steam — if it hasn’t started already.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",Disembodied Voices Were Blasted Into The Jungle By The U.S. In Vietnam To Spook The Enemy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the Vietnam-era U.S. military’s ceaseless quest to find new ways of sapping the morale of an often-elusive enemy, ‘ghosts’ were drafted in, too, as part of Operation Wandering Soul. It broadcast an eerie soundtrack of human voices as well as moans, screams, and shrieks, all calculated to mess with the minds of the enemy. The ultimate success (or otherwise) of this bizarre psychological warfare operation is hard to determine, but the surviving soundtrack of the so-called “Ghost Tape Number 10” makes for fascinating listening … especially around Halloween. In Bao Ninh’s famous Vietnam War novel The Sorrow of War , the protagonist, Kien, is given the job of helping to recover the remains of fallen soldiers once the Americans have left the country. The story, while fictionalized, is based on the real-life experiences of Vietnam’s Missing in Action teams, who gathered the dead while haunted by the conflict and what it had left behind. Ninh’s recollections of the battlefields — “Bloated human corpses, floating alongside the bodies of incinerated jungle animals, mixed with the branches and trunks cut down by artillery, all drifting in a stinking marsh” — remain in the reader’s mind, but so do the descriptions of the many ghosts that populate the jungles and the imaginations of the soldiers and civilians who survived. In the traditional Vietnamese understanding of death, ghosts play an important role, tied in with concepts of “good deaths” and “bad deaths.” Many of the almost one million North Vietnamese and Viet Cong war dead were understood as being in the category of “chet duong,” meaning that they had died violently, away from their family homes, and were unable to transition properly from the living world to the spirit world. Instead, tradition has it, their spirits were left to wander the battlefields, suspended between this life and the next. In traditional Vietnamese culture, these ghosts are known as ‘linh hon,’ or wandering souls.’ Ghosts, in general, had been identified by the U.S. military as a potentially effective element of psychological warfare operations in Vietnam. A U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) fact sheet published in December 1969, a portion of which you can find reproduced here , even outlined different types of ghosts that might be mobilized in support of psyops campaigns. The document describes the “ma heo” (pig ghost), “ma cho” (dog ghost), and “ma meo” (cat ghost) that were part of rural folklore in Vietnam. Other, more malevolent spirits included “the ‘tightening-knot ghost,’ which goads people into suicide by muttering ‘co co’ (neck, neck) into their ears. Ma A Phien is the opium ghost, related to addiction and eventual ‘death in the pleasures.’” A U.S. Marine Corps intelligence scout escorts a North Vietnamese Army soldier to the unit command post for interrogation. The NVA soldier surrendered to the Marines during operations close to An Hoa Combat Base., U.S. Marine Corps In its essence, Operation Wandering Soul had much in common with previous psychological warfare efforts, broadcasting specially prepared audio tracks to undermine the adversary. The difference was how it relied on this particular Vietnamese idea of the battlefield ghost to spook the enemy. The surviving Ghost Tape Number 10 was prepared by the U.S. Army’s 6th Psychological Operations Battalion, or 6th PSYOP Battalion , which had been activated in Vietnam in November 1965. Worthy of a horror movie soundtrack, it deployed disembodied voices and other unearthly sounds that would carry through the jungle like the wandering souls themselves. These were not just spooky sounds engineered to creep out the listener but were intended to have a much more visceral reaction among troops very likely to be familiar with the idea of “chet duong.” After all, for the credulous, what they were hearing was nothing less than the sounds of the fallen soldiers they had once fought alongside. South Vietnamese participants were brought into the recording process to make the audio tracks sound more authentic. Ghost Tape Number 10 was employed by the units of the U.S. Army and Navy, broadcast from loudspeakers on helicopters, Patrol Craft Fast (PCF) “Swift” boats , or by specialist infantry who would infiltrate enemy areas, normally at night. Nhan Ngoc Mai, a former Viet Cong soldier, uses a microphone to speak to villagers on the shore from a psyop boat during Project Loudspeaker, conducted by the 7th PSYOP Battalion, in the Chu Lai area, in 1969., NATIONAL ARCHIVES “My friends,” pleads a disembodied Vietnamese voice on the tape. “I have come back to let you know that I am dead… I am dead!” “It’s hell. … I’m in hell!” the track continues. “Don’t end up like me. Go home, friends, before it’s too late!” As well as the voices of fallen soldiers, the same tape included banging gongs, crying women, and a child calling for her father. To be sure, this particular psywar campaign was not always effective. There are reports of soldiers immediately opening fire in the direction of the speaker-equipped helicopters broadcasting it, for example. Another time, it’s reported that the crew of a Swift boat gave up playing the ghost tape in favor of Tina Turner after their boat began to be targeted with rockets. Soldiers drop leaflets and use loudspeakers from a UH-1 helicopter, as depicted in a painting by Craig L. Stewart, U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Artists Team IX.  , PUBLIC DOMAIN Since leaflet-dropping, surrender pamphlets, and other propaganda broadcasts were already widely employed already, many troops would have been familiar with the broader concept of U.S. psyops campaigns. A propaganda leaflet urging VC and North Vietnamese regular soldiers to defect to the South. , National Archives Others reckon that Ghost Tape Number 10 was at least sometimes very effective. “Even if the Viet Cong didn’t believe there were in fact ghosts in the jungle with them, that this was just a supernatural horror show being put on by the Americans, just the sounds and the message were more than a little eerie,” explains Nathan Mallett, of MilitaryHistoryNow.com, on The Stuff of Life podcast . Soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division prepare to move across a rice field in search of Viet Cong in Tuy Hoa, South Vietnam, in 1966., U.S. DoD In one truly remarkable extension of the ghost tape idea, it’s said that the 6th PSYOP Battalion added a tiger’s roar , capitalizing on rumors that there was a dangerous big cat attacking North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong troops. A former member of the battalion recalled the incident to psyops researcher Sergeant Major (ret.) Herbert A. Friedman: The 6th PSYOP got an Air Force pilot to fly to Bangkok, to get an actual recording of a tiger from their zoo. We had a Chieu Hoi [a Viet Cong defector] come down the mountain and tell of a tiger that was attacking the Viet Cong for the past few weeks. So, we mixed the tiger roar onto a tape of 69-T, “the Wandering Soul,” and a two-man team got up on the mountain, played the tape and 150 Viet Cong came off that mountain. As well as that account, there are reports of the tape being played in different parts of South Vietnam in late 1969 and early 1970 “with mixed results.” One mission, carried out in the jungle near the U.S. Army’s Fire Support Base Chamberlain in Hau Niga Province, on the night of Feb. 10, 1970, was described in a contemporaneous account in The Tropic Lightning News , which is reproduced here : If you were a Wolfhound of the First Battalion, 27th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division, and were at Fire Support Base Chamberlain on the night of February 10 you might have sworn the place was being haunted by poltergeists, ghosts that is. The moans, groans, and weird sounds began at eight that night, a likely time for the cloudlike forms to reveal themselves. Of course, ghosts are nonexistent, or are they? In this case, the ghosts and weird sounds were furnished by the Sixth PSYOP Team and the S-5 Section of the 1/27th Wolfhounds who were conducting a night mission at Chamberlain. With the help of loudspeakers and a tape of ‘The Wandering Soul,’ a mythical tale of a Viet Cong gone to Buddha, the mission was a success. A U.S. soldier hands out small yellow plastic balls to children to play with. The balls had “Chieu Hoi” printed on them in red, with the idea that they would fall into the hands of the Viet Cong and NVA and encourage them to give themselves up., AP Photo/Eddie Adams Furthermore, Raymond Deitch, who had commanded the 6th PSYOP Battalion, later recalled that “The tape was so effective that we were instructed not to play it within earshot of the South Vietnamese forces because they were as susceptible as the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese Army.” There’s even some evidence that the enemy leadership was indeed worried about the possible results of the ghost tape, and psyops broadcasts more generally. One account of the 4th Psychological Operations Group in Vietnam has it that a Viet Cong commander complained that “audio messages were hard to ignore, for the sound even penetrated through the earth to VC hidden in underground tunnels.” The same commander apparently pointed to Ghost Tape Number 10 as being particularly effective. A U.S. Marine explores a Viet Cong tunnel complex found by the 2d Battalion, 26th Marines, on the Batangan Peninsula during Operation Bold Mariner in 1969., U.S. MARINE CORPS On the other hand, even on the occasions that the ghost tape backfired and instead drew enemy fire, that could also be useful to uncover the location of the adversary. One unnamed U.S. Navy helicopter pilot told Herbert A. Friedman that their crew played the ghost tape “many times” in 1968 and 1969. “On about half the missions a PSYOP officer would fly with us and attempt to direct the mission. We dropped leaflets, magazines, and played the tape. Without exception, we drew fire each mission. This was one of the primary objectives of the mission.” The door gunner of a UH-1B gunship prepares for a firing run over a Viet Cong ambush site in the Mekong Delta. The helicopter was assigned to Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) 3, or HA(L)-3, which is known to have used the ghost tape on psyop missions., NATIONAL ARCHIVES Ultimately, it seems the success of Operation Wandering Soul was mixed, at best, at least when it came to diminishing the fighting morale of the enemy and motivating defections. However, similar concepts have resurfaced in successive U.S. campaigns since then, including the use of heavy metal music to make Manuel Noriega surrender and the broadcasts of crying, retreating troops, and other confusing sounds used against ISIS in the Middle East in recent years. But the sinister sounds of Ghost Tape Number 10 provide a remarkable glimpse into the psyche, real or imagined, of the different antagonists involved in the war in Southeast Asia.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 28, 2018",China Will Pay To Build A New Military Base On Tajikistan’s Border With Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tajikistan’s parliament had approved a plan to establish a new border security base with Chinese funding. This news comes amid other reports that Tajik authorities have offered to turn over control of a separate base in their country entirely to the Chinese government. All of this would seem to reflect a broader response from Beijing to the newly emerging security situation following the Taliban’s takeover of neighboring Afghanistan and the U.S. military’s controversial withdrawal from that country. There are particular fears that Al Qaeda, ISIS , and other terrorist organizations will be able to exploit the current situation to step up activities inside Afghanistan, as well as the surrounding region and elsewhere around the world. The lower house of Tajikistan’s Supreme Assembly signed off on the proposed base construction, which is part of a larger deal between the country’s Interior Ministry and China’s Public Security Ministry, on Oct. 27, 2021. Tajik First Deputy Interior Minister Abdurahmon Alamshozoda said that the facility would be situated in the village of Vakhon in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, according to the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty ‘s ( RFE/RL ) Tajik Service. Gorno-Badakhshan lies to the north of Afghanistan’s narrow Wakhan Corridor, which is wedged in between Tajikistan, China, and Pakistan. Tajik lawmaker Tolibkhon Azimzoda also said that it would cost around $10 million in total to build the base, but it’s not clear how much of that will be paid for by the Chinese government, RFE/RL reported . However, Tajik authorities have said that, at least officially, Chinese troops will not be stationed there. Elements of Tajikistan’s Rapid Reaction Group, a specialized paramilitary force assigned to the Ministry of Interior, is expected to be the main tenant, while regular Tajik military forces will also make use of the facility. “The exact function of the new base is unknown, although lawmakers said it would carry out policing duties focused on combating organized crime,” according to RFE/RL . “The facility would have ‘special equipment for the Interpol information system’ installed from China.” However, “the construction comes amid the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan and growing security threats along the country’s border,” Tajik parliamentarian Azimzoda made clear in a statement to RFE/RL . By every indication, China shares many of Tajikistan’s concerns — and has for some time. Though authorities in Dushanbe and Beijing have repeatedly denied it, there is significant evidence the two countries have been running a separate joint border security base near the village of Shaymak, which is also in Gorno-Badakhshan, since at least 2016. Prior to the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban in August, rotating contingents of Afghan government forces were reportedly stationed there , as well. Over the years, Chinese authorities have also repeatedly denied reports that they had deployed troops into the Wakhan Corridor itself, or were planning to do so. Afghan authorities had previously said that China had offered to train their troops and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has publicly conducted training exercises with Tajik forces . A map with Tajikistan’s Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province highlighted. Immediately to the south is Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor and to the east is China. Both the planned base at Vakhon and the existing one near Shaymak are extremely close to the Afghan-Tajik border along the northern edge of the Wakhan Corridor., Google Maps RFE/RL ‘s Tajik Service reported yesterday that documents it had seen said officials in Tajikistan have now proposed turning over the facility south of Shaymak to Chinese forces entirely. It’s unclear if authorities in Beijing accepted the offer or were otherwise warm to the idea. A separate report from RFE/RL earlier this month had said that there were indications that work was being done to expand this base and that there had been an uptick in activities emanating from it, including unmanned aircraft flights. Satellite imagery of this site from Planet Labs and other sources that The War Zone has reviewed appear to show only limited expansion of the facilities there in the past two years or so, though the initial construction work was significant. It also has no runway, meaning any unmanned aircraft would have to be launched via other means. This could suggest what residents have reportedly been hearing flying overhead are smaller types used for more localized surveillance and reconnaissance missions. These might use catapults to get airborne, take off and land vertically, or might even be hand-launched. Whatever the exact state of China’s cooperation with Tajikistan on regional security issues might be, a more robust ability to monitor activity in the region would certainly be in the interests of both countries. In particular, China has long used the threat posed by Islamist terrorist groups to justify its increasingly brutal crackdown on ethnic Uyghurs in the country’s far-western Xinjiang semi-autonomous region. Beijing has been seeking to engage with the Taliban directly , with so far unsubstantiated reports that it might be looking to establish bases inside Afghanistan. That group has expressed a willingness to try to clamp down on militant organizations like the Uyghur-founded East Turkestan Islamic Movement . At the same time, it’s not hard to see why China would want its own robust security presence in the region to gather intelligence and provide a staging point to take more direct action, should it decide that is necessary. The Chinese government has broader concerns about terrorist threats in the region, as well, which are only now magnified by the potential for various groups to exploit the current situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban is still working to solidify its control. In July, before the collapse of the preceding Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, nine Chinese engineers had already been killed in a suicide bombing targeting a bus in Pakistan. Though Pakistani officials sought to blame the governments of India and Afghanistan for that attack, local media reports linked it to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known simply as the Pakistani Taliban, which has links to its counterpart in Afghanistan. ISIS’s franchise in Afghanistan, called ISIS-Khorasan Province or ISIS-K, as well as al Qaeda, to which Afghanistan’s Taliban still has links , presents additional threats in the region and beyond. In many ways, Chinese involvement in Tajikistan reflects a broader trend in recent years of the country seeking new military footholds , or ones that could have a military use in a contingency scenario, around the world. Pursuing these kinds of arrangements in neighboring countries could offer something of an immediate buffer against various kinds of threats, not necessarily limited counter-terrorism concerns related to Afghanistan. For its part, the government of Tajikistan has been outspoken in its opposition to the Taliban and has actively engaged with a nascent Afghan resistance movement that is primarily operating in exile now and includes a significant number of ethnic Tajiks, as you can read more about here . The country also could face threats from various other terrorist groups already mentioned if the security situation in Afghanistan deteriorates. All this could make it difficult for officials in Dushanbe to ignore Chinese offers to help bolster its border security. In addition, Russia, which has a publicly acknowledged military presence in Tajikistan, said earlier this month that it was prepared to help defend that country against attacks coming from Afghanistan. Russia and Tajikistan are both members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) bloc, which includes mutual defense obligations. Various CSTO members recently took part in routine exercises in Tajikistan. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0lxmbKqS76U For China, increased security ties and general influence in Tajikistan could have broader geopolitical benefits. China is competing ever more on a regional basis with India, including directly over disputed territory along the border between the two countries, and globally with the United States . India has seen the previous government in Afghanistan as a valuable partner to challenge the designs of its chief rival Pakistan, as well as those of China. On the U.S. government side, President Joe Biden’s administration had defended following through the withdrawal from Afghanistan in no small part based on the argument that so-called “ over-the-horizon ” counter-terrorism capabilities would be sufficient to target any future threats emanating from that country. However, this seems to have been predicated largely on the assumption that neighboring countries would agree to host American troops or allow for their rapid deployment on a contingency basis, arrangements that do not seem to be forthcoming, at least so far. While there is no indication that Chinese influence has been a direct factor, Undersecretary of Defense Colin Kahl told senators just earlier this week that, despite “extensive conversations” with authorities in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, “we have not secured firm basing agreements.” He also added that “we could see ISIS-K generate that capability in somewhere between six or 12 months” when asked about the group’s potential ability to at least try to organize attacks on the United States from Afghanistan. There was a report over the weekend from CNN that the U.S. government was nearing an agreement with Pakistan for use of its airspace to conduct missions in Afghanistan, but not to base forces in that country. In September, the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe had also said that America would help Tajikistan improve its border security apparatus. All told, the new security deals between Tajikistan and China appear to reflect significant geopolitical shifts in the region, both with regard to Afghanistan specifically and the Chinese government’s interest in expanding its influence substantially abroad.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 9, 2021",China’s Carrier-Capable Naval Stealth Fighter Has Flown,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Photos beginning to appear on social media apparently show, beyond little doubt, the carrier version of China’s Shenyang FC-31 stealth fighter , which is expected to play a vital role in the continued and impressive development of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) carrier force. While we have previously seen an apparent mockup of the jet — the first stealthy carrier-capable fighter to be developed outside the United States — the new images show a prototype flying for what may well be the first time. The aircraft in question retains the same basic configuration as the land-based FC-31, first flown in prototype form in October 2012, but which has not yet won any orders from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force or export operators, to whom it has been increasingly targeted. Wearing a blue-green primer finish, the new jet has the same twin canted tailfins, twin engines, and high-mounted cockpit of the FC-31, but adds a catapult launch bar and a wing-fold mechanism, confirming it’s intended for carrier operations. Other notable features are a chin-mounted sensor turret, apparently analogous to the F-35’s Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), and what seems to be a remodeled cockpit canopy profile, with a shorter main transparency. The FC-31 carrier version seems to be derived from the baseline design’s improved second variation , which introduced a number of aerodynamic refinements over the original, including smaller ‘clipped’ and swept vertical tails, a less angular overall appearance, and cleaner surfaces. The second FC-31, which made its first flight in December 2016, is powered by a pair of indigenous WS-13E turbofan engines, replacing the Russian-supplied RD-93 engines used in the first. The designation of the new carrier fighter remains unknown, but there has been speculation in the past that it could be designated J-21 or J-35. A view of the dummy carrier deck at Wuhan that emerged earlier this year, with a carrier-based FC-31 mockup seen closest to the ‘island’., VIA TWITTER Being equipped for catapult operations for the outset, the new fighter seems certain to be intended to operate from the forthcoming Type 003 carrier — the third for the PLAN, and the first to have a distinctly domestic design. The Type 003 design is expected to be equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), rather than relying on the ski-jump ramps used on the PLAN’s previous two carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong . An artist’s impression of the FC-31 and the J-20 over the carrier Liaoning . , AP While construction of the Type 003 carrier continues to make rapid progress, a carrier-capable naval version of the FC-31 has long been rumored. This would provide a stealthy complement to the Shenyang J-15 , a Chinese-made Sukhoi Flanker derivative that’s in service with the PLAN today, and which goes to sea aboard its first two carriers. A catapult-capable variant of this aircraft has been in testing for some time. J-15 carrier fighters on board China’s first aircraft carrier, the Type 001 Liaoning. , IMAGINECHINA VIA AP IMAGES “Development continues on the smaller FC-31/J-31 for export or as a future naval fighter for the PLAN’s next class of aircraft carriers,” according to an annual report on Chinese military developments the Pentagon sent to Congress in 2020. For its part, China has been tight-lipped about the carrier jet, but in December 2019, a silhouette of the FC-31 appeared on the Weibo microblogging site of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — of which Shenyang is a subsidiary — described as a “future carrier-borne fighter.” Days later, Shenyang announced it was developing a ‘new’ fighter, leading to speculation this was the long-awaited FC-31 carrier variant, although no such specifics were provided. Reworking an existing land-based fighter for deck operations is no mean feat. In the past we outlined some of the challenges involved: Typically, it may involve aerodynamic changes, optimizing the aircraft for the different angles of attack encountered on takeoff and landing, perhaps including additional high-lift devices on the wing. The flight-control system will need adaptation too, and then there are potential structural changes to reinforce the airframe for the stresses of launch and recovery. Invariably, the undercarriage will need to be beefed up and a catapult launch bar and arrester hook are requirements, too. More extensive use of composite materials may be required to prevent corrosion. Finally, for stowage on board ship, the wing panels would require folding mechanisms. Clearly, the new carrier variant is at a fairly early stage in its development, but its low-observable features and modern characteristics overall would provide the PLAN with a significant new capability to match its power-projection ambitions. However, spinning off the FC-31 into a carrier fighter was likely the plan all along, and its development will benefit greatly from nearly a decade of testing and evolution of its land-based progenitor. The fighter’s capabilities are expected to be reinforced by the KJ-600 carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft, which has been noted in mock-up form since at least 2018. An actual prototype of this plane was spotted undergoing flight trials last summer and, simultaneous with the appearance of the navalized FC-31, the KJ-600 has again been seen undergoing flight tests, with new photos emerging today as well. So far, the images of the FC-31 carrier variant seem to be legitimate, but there are likely to be more that will confirm its existence beyond a doubt. With that in mind, we will continue to update this story accordingly. In the meantime, it now seems we have the first evidence that China’s plans for a stealth fighter to equip its future carrier air wings have taken flight. In a very busy week for Chinese tactical aviation developments, it’s once again clear that Beijing’s airpower ambitions are rapidly taking shape. Now it could very well be that the Type 003 carrier enters into service with a stealth fighter being tested aboard its deck.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The twin-turboprop, twin-boom OV-10 Bronco is one of those rare aircraft that seems to never cease being of interest . Not only does nothing much else look quite like it, but this counterinsurgency specialist has enjoyed a truly unusual career trajectory, which has taken it from the jungles of Vietnam, via Operation Desert Storm, to hunting ISIS insurgents in Iraq. In the meantime, it’s also seen combat in some lesser-known conflicts, from confronting guerrillas in the Philippines to taking part in a coup d’état in Venezuela . Today, its unique flying qualities and capabilities mean it’s in demand for training Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTACs), more widely known as Forward Air Controllers. But what was it actually like to fly the Bronco as a frontline combat aircraft during its tenure with the U.S. Air Force? Unlike its more glamorous fast-jet brethren, the OV-10’s Air Force career is little known and rarely publicized. One man who can help set that record straight is ‘Danno,’ who spent his last two Air Force assignments strapped in the cockpit of the Bronco. Over to you, ‘Danno’… A Royal Thai Air Force OV-10C Bronco during Exercise Cobra Gold in 1987., U.S. DoD The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway asked me a couple of years ago when he noticed I had some military flying experience if I might have some stories to contribute. I more or less blew him off, as I value privacy and don’t normally toot my own horn. But I’m getting old now, and my kinfolk don’t give a crap about what I did, so I’ve changed my mind, and thought I’d share a couple of stories that might be of interest to the readers here since they are about a favorite topic: war machines. I ultimately accumulated 810 hours in the OV-10 during my two tours at the 27th Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS) at George Air Force Base, California, and the 19th TASS at Osan in South Korea . That total includes about 50 hours in the Thai OV-10C model (the U.S. Air Force model was the OV-10A). My whole time flying OV-10s (and my earlier F-4 Phantom II assignments) was peacetime simulated combat. I had previous-enlisted time prior to 1971 (not in Vietnam) and that counted towards my 20-years of active duty. I got my wings in 1974 and retired in December 1989, and there were no major wars in that period. President Ronald Reagan managed to get us into a few small conflicts (Beirut, Grenada, and Panama) but I didn’t participate. My stories are not about war. There are several good Vietnam-era books that tell stories of brave Forward Air Controllers in OV-10s (as well as O-1 and O-2 aircraft) during that war. In the meantime, I’ll just temporarily call this forum the ‘Cold War Zone.’ Having said that, I did shoot a lot of 2.75-inch marking rockets (usually with a white phosphorus warhead, dubbed ‘Willy Pete’) and dropped a lot of 25-pound practice bombs (BDU-33s; they had a small smoke charge) from the Bronco. We used the small practice bombs to mark targets on ranges when the Air Force said we were getting short on Willy Pete. The only time I fired the M60 machine guns was when I flew the Thai C-models. They had left the guns in the aircraft, while the USAF had taken them out. The twin M60 machine guns in one of the sponsons of a Thai OV-10C., RoyKabanlit/Wikimedia Commons This is a short story about a Military Training Team (MTT) I led in Thailand to instruct a few Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) OV-10C squadron pilots in the art of Forward Air Control. This took place in February and March 1987. In 1986, I checked out in OV-10s after several years as an F-4G (Advanced Wild Weasel) pilot. The Bronco wasn’t my first choice in a change of weapons systems, but, you know, the needs of the Air Force came first, and I became mildly excited about flying it during peacetime. It would definitely be a change of pace, because flying Weasel tactics during the early 1980s was mainly done at 500 feet (or lower) and the speed of heat. Seeing what was on the ground in the Phantom at those speeds was blurry — unless you were pointing at the ground and a target. Identifying details on the ground was something I thought would be fun. The OV-10A squadron (27th TASS) to which I was assigned needed experienced fighter pilots (at least that is what the assignment people said). This was a large Bronco squadron with over 40 airframes and a shitload of pilots. The Air Force had recently deactivated two OV-10 squadrons at Sembach in West Germany, and they were all brought to George AFB. Over half the pilots were what we called ‘FAFACs’ (First Assignment Forward Air Controllers). They were pilots out of UPT (Undergraduate Pilot Training), and the Bronco is what they were awarded, with the likely follow-on assignment in a fighter. Most of these guys were first lieutenants and wet behind the ears. A U.S. Air Force OV-10A from the 27th TASS at George AFB in January 1987., Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons FAFACs were flying the Bronco more or less to keep their flying skills up to speed and learn the tactical environment. Their primary job was acting as Battalion Air Liaison Officers (ALOs) with the U.S. Army. At least twice a year, they would go on temporary duty (TDY) to their assigned unit with the Army on exercises and camp out in tents and drive around in Humvees or armored personnel carriers, and coordinate air support for the battalions. If war broke out, that was their job, while us more experienced and higher-ranking officers would be tasked to fly the OV-10s as FACs. I never had to eat MREs as I (deservedly) fell into the latter category. Another 27th TASS OV-10A over California. , VIA AUTHOR After about eight months of being a flight commander, I was made chief of STANEVAL (standardization and evaluation) and was in charge of four or five other evaluators. We gave all the check rides to the squadron pilots. A month into this job, the squadron commander (an O-6) called me in and asked if I wanted to head an MTT for about a month in Thailand. The RTAF had two squadrons of OV-10Cs and had requested some FAC training, as they were a little unsure about how it worked. They were primarily using their Broncos for counterinsurgency and were worried about FAC tasking in a Cobra Gold exercise that included U.S. fighters. I didn’t hesitate in volunteering as I had been to Thailand several times during my stint flying F-4s at Clark Air Base, Philippines, and I loved the place, especially the food and, uh, other things. The team was three pilots, one other guy from my squadron and one pilot (who would meet us in Bangkok) from the OV-10 squadron at Wheeler Air Force Base in Hawaii. We learned the Thai squadron we would be working with was based in Chiang Mai. To those who are familiar with the country, you know that is a ‘sweet’ northern city with much cooler temperatures with great sightseeing and plenty of after-hours activities. The three MTT instructors with ‘Kag,’ the Thai squadron secretary. She wanted to get in every photo we took. In the background is an RTAF OV-10C. I am on the far right., VIA AUTHOR Before leaving, my squadron mate and I prepared a training syllabus that included classroom lectures and flying training missions. We were told by the gurus at TAC HQ at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, that there weren’t going to be any live weapon deliveries (marking rockets) because range space/time was limited there. All flying training was going to be what we called ‘dry CAS’ [close air support]. We packed up our harnesses, G-suits, helmets, clipboards, etc., and headed to Thailand from California. We had a free day in Bangkok, so I reacquainted myself with Patpong and Soi Cowboy (Google it). A Thai OV-10C on the flight line during the joint Thai/U.S. Exercise Thalay Thai in 1989., NATIONAL ARCHIVES I’ll not bore you with the details of our reception and classroom instruction except to say it went very well. It was obvious to us they had picked their best English speakers among the five or six pilots to be trained. Even then, Thai English can be a little hard to understand if you’re not used to it, so it was a minor problem. We finally started flying with them, as instructors in the back seat. Basic FAC tactics include what is called a nine-line brief to the fighters you are working with. On a couple of training sorties, we actually had RTAF F-5Es fly up from Korat to do the dry CAS. On the other flights, the squadron’s other OV-10s simulated the fighters. We soon figured out that we had to simplify the nine-line brief. VIA AUTHOR We decided to use low-threat tactics, talk the fighters to the target area, put them in a wheel above us, then give them items four to eight. Since it was all dry, our most-used simulated targets were a village or town Buddhist temple. These buildings stood out with gold or orange roofs and were easy to talk the fighter pilot’s eyes onto as the target. I tried to use bridges and river banks several times and that was hit or miss with the simulated fighter guys who couldn’t get their eyes on the target. Maybe it was a language problem but our inability to mark the targets with a Willy Pete added to the difficulties. I later asked the U.S. Assistant Air Attaché at the embassy in Bangkok if we should have been dry dive-bombing temples and he didn’t think it was a good idea. But he was a former C-141 pilot. What the hell did he know? The Thai pilots couldn’t care less. A typical Buddhist temple, as found in towns and villages across Thailand. We used them as simulated targets since it was easy to talk the Thai fighter pilot’s eyes onto them., VIA AUTHOR The Thai OV-10C was almost identical to the OV-10A we flew back at home, with minor cockpit differences. The main one, I remember, is they didn’t have a fire-suppression agent for the engines in case of an engine fire. Performance between the two models was identical; that is, very good performance with two engines running but lousy performance if you lost one. Fortunately, that never occurred during our TDY. As previously mentioned, the Thais also left the four M60 machine guns in the sponsons while the USAF had them all removed. The training was progressing as expected when one morning, about two weeks into the MTT, the Thai squadron commander informed us that a car was waiting to take us to the U.S. Consulate in Chiang Mai. We didn’t even know a U.S. Consulate existed there. We arrived and were ushered into an office where a balding gray-haired guy in a white shirt, with glasses, was standing beneath a rotating ceiling fan. He introduced himself at the U.S. Consulate General. Standing to his side was some Caucasian dude in an Aloha shirt with sunglasses on, although it wasn’t particularly bright in the room. I immediately thought of a 1960s movie scene out of The Ugly American . The Consulate General introduced the shades guy as Agent “John Smith” from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). We were offered water and invited to sit down. They then began their briefing. Some background info might help: In 1986, Reagan had declared war on drugs, and the primary focus was on the Colombian cartels. But the Golden Triangle area just north of Chiang Mai still produced the hard drugs from poppies that we know as opium and heroin. The Thai government was getting enormous pressure from the United States to do something about the drug traffic from that area. The DEA guy told us Chiang Mai was the home of a couple of drug lords who were involved in most of the heroin traffic from the Golden Triangle. He said that, because we three were the only U.S. military guys in the whole damn city working with the RTAF, we had to leave town for a few days because our lives could be at risk. That got our attention, and I asked why. He reluctantly told us the Thai OV-10 squadron, which was our host, was going to conduct a drug interdiction mission that might involve casualties. Depending on how the mission was executed, the drug lords residing in Chiang Mai may think that our presence at the squadron would indicate our involvement somehow, even though we were strictly doing CAS training. A rare seven-ship of Thai OV-10Cs (including the photo ship). This formation was likely set up for photo op., VIA AUTHOR After hearing that, we readily accepted the offer of flying (commercially) back to Bangkok for a few days. “Where are the flight tickets, and what five-star hotel did you book us in?” was an immediate question. Naturally, we wished for more detail on the operation, but at this point, we knew the Thai pilots quite well, and we were sure they would spill the beans regarding the mission. Prior to catching a flight that night, we went back to the squadron, and the Thai operations officer told us the training had been suspended for four days because they were involved in a mission. We knew, of course, it wasn’t a FAC/CAS mission, so I asked one of the more friendly pilots what was going on. He didn’t hesitate to lay it out for me. They were arming four OV-10s to carry two Mk 82 dumb bombs each. Those are 500-pound high-explosive and make quite a boom. On the Bronco, they were attached to a single rack which was bolted to each sponson. The centerline tank remained on the aircraft in this configuration. I asked ‘Pui’ (that was the pilot’s nickname) what they were bombing, and he said a heroin processing plant. I asked him where and, to my surprise, he pointed on a wall map to a site about 10 kilometers inside Burma (now also known as Myanmar). I thought it was good we were getting the hell out of Dodge, since they were going to be bombing a foreign country which may trigger something more serious. (Burma at that time had little or no air defense capability, but still …). VIA AUTHOR So off we went to Bangkok, and I re-reacquainted myself and the team with Patpong and Soi Cowboy for the next three days. We did a couple of touristy things but spent a lot of time in ex-pat watering holes in that city. After a few days, we got a call from the Embassy and ticket pickup instructions to fly back to Chiang Mai and resume training. The timeline had been interrupted by four days of no training, so we had to adlib our training syllabus, but I think they learned the basics of what an airborne FAC is supposed to do. I asked ‘Pui’ how the mission into Burma went, and all he gave me was a thumbs up. None of us could get any further information from any of the pilots, so I suspect they were being told to keep their traps shut. In retrospect, I’m not sure their mission went well at all, and it could have just been action to appease the U.S. pressure. For all I know, the Mk 82s may have just made a few divots in the jungle to the north. It’s possible they didn’t even cross the border. So the results of that operation remain a mystery. ‘Pui’ poses in front of one of the OV-10Cs., VIA AUTHOR After another week or so of training, we said goodbye to the Thai Bronco pilots and returned to our base in California, flying peacetime CAS with an occasional deviation for an actual search and rescue (like looking for Dean Martin’s son) or other search missions. The Thais threw us a going-away party on St. Patrick’s Day. Some personnel from the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group at the U.S. Embassy flew up to join in., VIA AUTHOR Six or seven months passed, and I missed the more exciting (IMHO) flying in Asia, so I volunteered for a remote tour flying OV-10s at Osan Air Base. I was surprised when the assignment shoe clerks asked if I could be ready to go in a month. Hell yes! Security policemen race from a Cadillac Gage Commando armored personnel carrier to defend an OV-10 during an operational readiness inspection at Osan Air Base in the early 1980s., U.S. DoD As an aside, together with a first lieutenant at the Osan squadron, I flew the final Pacific Air Forces OV-10 sortie when we ferried it down to a small airfield in South Korea where it was wrapped up and put on a barge in August or September 1989. It was one of those that was given to the Philippines for their air force. I enjoyed my Bronco flying in Korea, which was much closer to the action than the high desert of California. I was again appointed the chief of STANEVAL and, in early 1989, I got called to the group commander’s office. He asked me if I wanted to go back to Thailand. He further stated that I was a ‘by-name request’ to go back and give the same squadron more FAC training. Not only was I flattered, but I jumped on the opportunity. Kimchi and Bulgogi were good, but I yearned for some Tom Yum Gai and Pad Thai again. And I was to be solo on this MTT — just me and the Thais. Three OV-10As from the 27th TASS at George AFB during a deployment to Palmerola Air Base in Honduras in 1987. I had already transferred to Korea by this point so wasn’t part of this TDY., VIA AUTHOR And that MTT was an entirely different story. I returned to Chiang Mai in February 1989 to the same RTAF OV-10 squadron and actually got some front-seat time. The new squadron commander was a young lieutenant colonel who was married to the king’s number-three daughter. She was a genuine princess, and he was called the Royal Consort. The previous squadron commander (during my 1987 MTT) had gotten shot down in a Bronco when Thailand and Laos had a short-lived border dispute in late 1987. In fact, he had been captured after bailing out over the disputed area in Laos and was only released when a ceasefire was agreed upon and prisoners were exchanged. I didn’t see him during my ’89 MTT. The three American instructors with the commander of 411 Squadron, RTAF, and the operations officer. The squadron commander is in the blue uniform He was later shot down in a Bronco during a border dispute with Laos., VIA AUTHOR So that just about wraps up my story about the OV-10, although there were a few interesting things that happened on that MTT, as well. To conclude, it’s worth pointing out that I was single this whole time, with no kids that I knew of. So, I was very flexible in my personal logistics. As for Thailand’s Bronco fleet, the last of these aircraft were finally withdrawn from service in 2004, after more than three decades of service. Eight of the former RTAF aircraft were provided to the Philippines, which today is the sole military operator of the type, whose aircraft continue the Bronco’s long tradition of counterinsurgency warfare in the Asia Pacific region.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 25, 2022",Russian Su-35 Fighters Appear For The First Time At Northeastern Syria Airbase: Reports,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At least one Su-35S Flanker fighter jet has apparently made the first visit by a Russian combat jet to Qamishli Airport, in northeastern Syria, a strategically important location close to U.S. forces still in the country that lies right on the border with Turkey. Unconfirmed reports suggest this could be part of a larger deployment of as many as four of these jets to the base, which may reflect Moscow’s ambition to strengthen its presence in this part of Syria. The undated photo, seen at the top of this story and in the Tweet below, purportedly shows a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S , coded ‘07 Red,’ at Qamishli Airport in Syria’s Al-Hasakah governorate. It emerged yesterday and geolocation based on open-source imagery has indicated that the location where it was reportedly taken is at least accurate. The Flanker in question, shown armed with medium-range R-77 and short-range R-73 series air-to-air missiles is said to be one of four that arrived recently at the base. The Su-35S has been a regular presence in Syria since Moscow launched its intervention there in September 2015, after an official request by the Syrian government. Unnamed sources reportedly told the Lebanon-based Al Mayadeen TV channel that the Flankers have already conducted “several reconnaissance flights” in the area. The same sources apparently said the fighters would “remain at the airport indefinitely.” However, The War Zone has so far been unable to source satellite imagery of Qamishli Airport that would confirm a more permanent presence of one or more Su-35s, which would in turn support reports that these jets may now be flying from there regularly. While we can’t be entirely sure, low-resolution imagery from the past week of the main ramp at the airport that the Russians use shows activity that looks to be well in line with what we have seen routinely in the past two years. While a permanent Su-35S presence at Qamishli would mark a significant new development, Russia has made use of the same base in the past for regular operations by helicopters. Rotorcraft operating out of Qamishli have reportedly been especially active in supporting ground forces in the area, as Russia apparently seeks to bolster its military presence in the region. Il-76 transport aircraft are frequent visitors to Qamishli, as well. A satellite view of Qamishli Airport, from September 2020, as an example of the kinds of activity typically seen at the base. , Google Earth A close-up reveals Russian activity in the form of one Il-76 transport and four helicopters., Google Earth The jet, with its air-to-air missile armament, could simply have been making a brief stopover at Qamishli, perhaps as part of an escort mission for transports or VIP aircraft, which is a routine job for these jets in Syria. Another possibility is that the jet had some kind of inflight emergency that required it to land here. If Russia is conducting more extensive operations in this part of the country, then the fighter could also have been using the base for refueling or possibly rearming. It should be noted that that there are reports stretching back to 2016, at least, that Russia might have an interest in establishing a more permanent airbase in Qamishli. So far, however, Russian fighter jets have not been a presence in the northeast of the country, instead being concentrated at Khmeimim Air Base on Syria’s west coast. Earlier this year, Russian MiG-31K Foxhound jet fighters armed with Kinzhal missiles and Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers visited Khmeimim, taking part in exercises in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and shadowing the British aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and its carrier strike group. At the same time, there have been recent reports of increased activity by the Russian Aerospace Forces, more generally, close to the Turkish border. This includes airstrikes directed against anti-Assad groups located north of the city of Idlib, in the west of the country. Last year, Russia and Turkey clashed on the ground over Idlib, with significant casualties on both sides. Moscow has had a foothold in the region around Qamishli since October 2019, when its ground forces began active patrols of the area. It had previously ostensibly been under the control of U.S. forces and their local, predominantly Kurdish partners. After brokering a deal with Turkey, Russia then moved into the area, while the Turkish military began efforts to remove U.S.-backed Kurdish groups from a buffer zone along Syria’s northern border. An official US military map dated December 2019 showing various areas of interest in northeastern Syria, including Qamishli, as well as approximate zones of control. , U.S. DoD For its part, the U.S. military still maintains a presence in northeast Syria, with a network of forward bases that are used by American and other coalition forces, in cooperation with local Kurdish groups. Earlier this year, the Pentagon confirmed there were approximately 900 American troops spread across these various Syrian outposts. The U.S. military in the area also likely has its own organic air defenses, with Avenger short-range air defense systems having been seen heading toward the Syrian border from Iraq earlier this year . The Avenger is intended to defeat low-flying fixed-wing manned aircraft and helicopters, but can also be employed against drones, which are considered an ever-growing threat in Syria and the wider region. The area around Qamishli in particular has already been the scene of tense encounters between Russian and U.S. forces, including a dramatic altercation between a U.S. military M-ATV mine-resistant vehicle and a Russian Tiger armored utility vehicle in February last year, that we reported on in-depth at the time . This followed various other incidents between U.S. and Russian forces in the northeast of the country, typically involving American troops blocking the movement of Russian forces, but there have also been reports of more physical altercations , too. The moment of a collision between U.S. and Russian military vehicles off the road near Qamishli in northeastern Syria, in February 2020., TWITTER VIDEO CAPTURE VIA @IBRASHINO Meanwhile, in previous years, Russian and American warplanes have been involved in a series of aggressive encounters over the country. However, in the past four to five years, Russian combat aircraft have typically stayed in the western part of Syria as part of a deconfliction arrangement with the United States. Though that agreement has since been violated on many occasions , the deployment of Russian warplanes in the eastern part of the country would seem to amount to a significant breach of this protocol American combat jets continue to be available for responding to aerial and other threats to U.S. interests in Syria, with U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles based in Jordan having been heavily utilized in recent years. Meanwhile, on occasions in the past, there have also been incidents between U.S. and Syrian government forces near Qamishli. In February 2020 a standoff between U.S. troops and a mob aligned with Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad at a checkpoint near Qamishli escalated into a brief gun battle , while U.S. Air Force F-15 combat jets conducted a show of force overhead. These tensions in the skies over Syria also more broadly reflect the sometimes hostile encounters between U.S. and Russian aircraft , as well as naval vessels , in other parts of the world since then, as well. As well as the potential implications of having Russian warplanes stationed close to U.S. troops, there’s also the fact that Qamishli is on the border with Turkey, too. In recent weeks, Russian warplanes have been increasingly active against Turkish-backed Syrian National Army forces in northern Syria, as well as against the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group. There have also been reports of Russian airstrikes on the border itself , which would risk drawing a response from Turkey. The relationship between Moscow and Ankara in regards to Syria has been a complex one through recent years, with a low point being the Turkish Air Force shooting down a Russian Su-24 Fencer bomber that strayed across its border in November 2015. Last year, a deal of sorts was struck when plans were laid out for a formal buffer zone between the two sides in northern Syria, together with joint patrols by Turkish and Russian troops. Nevertheless, the widely differing objectives in Moscow and Ankara mean that the situation in northern Syria remains highly charged. Turkey remains intent on neutering Assad’s military capabilities while continuing to prosecute its campaign against Kurdish militia groups. Russia seeks to continue its access to geopolitically strategic naval and airbase facilities along the eastern Mediterranean, for which Assad retaining control of the whole of Syria is not a prerequisite. As for whether the appearance of Russian fighter jets at a new location in northeast Syria could lead to further encounters between Russian and U.S. or Turkish forces, with the risk of leading to a sudden escalation in tensions, that’s too early to say. So far, we don’t have conclusive evidence that one or more Su-35S is now at Qamishli. If one of the aircraft was at that airbase, there’s still the possibility that it was a fleeting visit rather than part of a long-term deployment there.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 30, 2021",This Is A Great Comparison Between General Atomics’ Avenger Drone Configurations,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two pictures taken earlier this week at El Mirage Field in California offer an excellent comparison of the relative sizes and other features between General Atomics’ stealthy Avenger unmanned aircraft and its larger cousin, the Avenger Extend Range, or Avenger ER. The drones had been out earlier in the day with various U.S. Air Force aircraft, including an RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone, and testbed jets belonging to a number of defense contractors, as part of the latest iteration of the Orange Flag exercise . The Avenger and Avenger ER participation in the drill appears to be linked in some way to the Air Force’s Skyborg program , which is developing artificial intelligence-driven autonomous capabilities for use on “loyal wingman” type drones , as well as unmanned combat air vehicles , or UCAVs. Expert plane tracker and friend of The War Zone @AircraftSpots grabbed the shots of the Avenger and Avenger ER, which carry the U.S. civil registration codes N901PC and N903PC, respectively, as they returned to El Mirage on Oct. 26, 2021. This is a private airfield owned by General Atomics and used for various research and development and test and evaluation purposes. The original Avenger, also known as the Predator C, first flew in 2009. The first flight of the larger Avenger ER took place in 2016. You can read more about both types here . There is some confusion about what official nomenclature the U.S. Air Force uses for the Avenger and Avenger ER. The designation YQ-11 has been associated with the Avenger in the past. More recently, MQ-20 has been used , but that may only apply to the Avenger ER. It’s also unclear how many Avengers the Air Force or other U.S. government agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, might actually own. The Air Force has confirmed purchasing one and initially indicated that it might be sent to Afghanistan for field testing, something the service subsequently denied . General Atomics has said in the past that it has sold “up to seven” more of these drones to an unspecified U.S. government entity and that at least one of those was used to drop propaganda leaflets in Syria. You can read more about what we know of the operational history of U.S. government-owned Avengers here . There have also been reports about potential sales to foreign customers, including India , that have not materialized. A General Atomics Avenger, with the US civil registration code N901PC, photographed landing at El Mirage Field on Oct. 26, 2021., @aircraftspots The Avenger and the Avenger ER both have the same general configuration, with swept ‘lambda’-like wing, v-tail, dorsal-mounted engine intake, chined fuselage, and shrouded exhaust. However, as is clear from @AircraftSpots’ pictures, the Avenger ER is substantially larger in all respects. The standard Avenger has a wingspan of 66 feet and an overall length of 44 feet, with a maximum takeoff weight of around 18,200 pounds, of which 7,900 pounds is fuel. The Avenger ER’s wingspan is 10 feet wider, and it has a significantly longer forward fuselage. General Atomics has said it can carry 2,000 pounds of additional fuel, giving it five more hours of total flying time over its smaller cousin’s 15-hour endurance. The Avenger ER, with the U.S. civil registration code N903PC, as it also approached El Mirage on Oct. 26., @aircraftspots In 2016, General Atomics said that Avenger and Avenger ER had the same internal payload bay, which could accommodate up to 3,000 pounds of sensors, including outsized ones , or munitions. The Avenger ER’s payload capacity has since grown to 4,000 pounds, according to company press releases . The Avenger ER is also regularly seen with a sensor turret under the nose, something not usually seen on standard Avengers that are used for testing. The overall design is low-observable, meaning it has reduced radar and infrared signatures, but it is not to be compared to a very low-observable asset where stealth is the primary driver of the design. A top-down look at a standard Avenger drone., General Atomics/Tyson Rininger In this particular case, both N901PC and N903PC were carrying Lockheed Martin Legion Pods , as well. The Avenger and Avenger ER have each been observed equipped with these pods in the past. The Legion Pod has an IRST21 infrared search and track (IRST) system mounted at the front, but the center section is designed to accept additional modular, open-architecture payloads. Earlier this year, Lockheed Martin announced that the Air Force had been testing a version of the pod equipped with a datalink allowing for the transfer of information from one to another “near instantaneously.” A Lockheed Martin infographic describing the basic capabilities of the Legion Pod., Lockheed Martin As for what the two drones were doing, we don’t know for sure, but the controllers for N901PC and N903PC were using the callsigns Skyborg 01 and Skyborg 03, respectively. In addition, in June, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) announced that an Avenger ER had carried a version of the Skyborg “autonomy core system,” or ACS, the computer brain being developed as part of that project, during an earlier iteration of Orange Flag. In August, General Atomics said it had demonstrated the ability of a Legion Pod-equipped Avenger to autonomously spot, track, and follow targets of interest, though it did not specifically say that test had been in support of the Skyborg program. In December 2020, General Atomics, along with Boeing and Kratos, was selected to provide actual unmanned aircraft for Skyborg testing. That same month, the company announced it had test-flown an unspecified Avenger type equipped with a different “autonomy engine,” which had been originally developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is now maintained by the U.S. Navy, on a mock aerial combat mission together with five other simulated drones. That test had also been linked to the Skyborg program. The two Avenger types participating in Orange Flag, either carrying Skyborg-related systems or otherwise acting as surrogates for the capabilities that the program is developing, makes good sense. It would also be valuable to have them there as part of work on adjacent projects, such as the Legion Pod. The Air Force held its first Orange Flag in 2018. The exercise is one of a number of so-called “test flags,” which are intended to explore new technologies and concepts of operations in the context of a large force exercise that is more representative of a real-world conflict. You can read more about these exercises here . Online flight tracking software and publicly broadcast radio communications showed that a Cessna 210 from private contractor Chalk 2 , which regularly works with General Atomics drones, was also in the air acting as a chase plane. Boeing’s unique Catfish 757 testbed, Raytheon’s ‘Voodoo 1’ 727 sensor test jet, and a Calspan Aerospace Learjet capable of acting as a surrogate for various unmanned platforms were also noted flying east of Edwards Air Force Base as part of the Orange Flag exercise. One of the Air Force’s RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drones was also spotted flying around Plant 42 in Palmdale , Calif., before it also headed to the exercise area. Plant 42 is home, among other things, to Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division , which developed these unmanned aircraft. A number of Air Force aerial refueling tankers were up in the air at the time, as well. It’s certain that other Air Force aircraft, and possibly aircraft from other branches of the U.S. military, took part in the exercise, too, but weren’t necessarily trackable publicly. In this Orange Flag exercise, the Avenger and Avenger ER, specifically, could have used their Legion Pods to autonomously search for aerial threats and then pursue them, all while passing that data to other platforms. In addition, IRST systems are not impacted by a stealthy target’s radar-absorbing features, making it an ideal way to detect those targets. All told, drones equipped in this manner could greatly expand the entire friendly force’s ability to quickly find and engage aerial targets, as well as provide additional overall situational awareness. If the pods have built-in datalinks, the two different Avengers would be able to provide instant triangulation of targets, as well. A single IRST-equipped aircraft cannot readily determine the range of a threat, though workarounds are possible, as you can read more about in this past War Zone feature . This, in turn, would allow the pair to generate engagement quality telemetry. A notional loyal wingman drone capable of carrying its own air-to-air weaponry could then be able to target a threat directly, or this data could be passed to other platforms. Since IRST systems are passive sensors , an opponent might not even know it was in danger, especially if another friendly platform then engaged it from beyond visual range. A graphic depicting the fusion of data from networked Legion Pods on a pair of F-16Ds., Lockheed Martin These are exactly the kinds of capabilities that the Air Force hopes it will get from the advanced loyal wingmen drone concepts being explored now under the Skyborg program. The service also hopes that effort will lead into the development of larger, more capable fully autonomous UCAVs, as well. All told, it seems it seems very likely that we will only continue to see more of General Atomics’ two Avenger designs support Skyborg, as well as other developmental efforts. However, it may be less common to see them contrasted together as well as they were in the pair of pictures @AircraftSpots took at El Mirage.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Engaging different kinds of aerial targets at short range with heat-seeking missiles is part of the bread and butter for every fighter pilot. It’s not so often, however, that we get a chance to see that process being put to the test, end to end, in a live-fire environment . Now, video has emerged showing one of the world’s more secretive air forces doing just that, with an Iranian fighter launching an infrared-guided missile at a target at very close quarters and at an impressively low level. The video in question, brought to our attention by Twitter user @AmirIGM , is undated but shows very clearly an Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, or IRIAF, MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jet taking part in a live-fire air-to-air missile drill alongside an F-5 Tiger II jet — apparently a two-seat F-5F model — from the same service. The MiG-29 and the F-5 begin by flying in fingertip formation, with the Fulcrum tucked in behind the American-made fighter’s left wing. As the MiG pulls level with the F-5, the latter launches an aerial target, which then streaks ahead of the Fulcrum. The F-5 pulls away to the right and moments later, the MiG launches a single missile from under its right wing. Leaving a prominent smoke trail behind it, the missile then homes in on the target and detonates. The time between the missile coming off the rail and the explosion is no more than around four seconds. MiG-29 and F-5 fly in close formation at the start of the live-fire missile training., VIA TWITTER What we see fired by the MiG-29 is very clearly a Vympel R-73 heat-seeking air-to-air missile, a popular and widely used Soviet-designed weapon that’s known in the West as the AA-11 Archer. It has been in use in 1984 but remains a generally well-regarded weapon, due to its high levels of maneuverability and the fact it can be designated via the pilot’s helmet-mounted sight, as well as by the aircraft’s radar or infrared search and track (IRST) sensor. An R-73 air-to-air missile on display. Black bands on the weapon indicate an inert round., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimdia Commons While only a rough estimate, this engagement would appear to be very much at the lower limit of the R-73’s envelope, the missile’s single-stage rocket motor burning between four and seven seconds, with the maximum time of the controlled flight being 23 seconds. The maximum range of the R-73 is around 19 miles for a head-on target, reducing to around 9 miles for a tail-on engagement. Against a close-range tail-on target, as here, the minimum launch distance is also a factor, and the R-73 can be launched from less than 1,000 feet. As for what’s being shot down here, that’s less obvious, but it’s apparently a rocket target, rather than the more commonly seen towed target that’s deployed from another aircraft via a reel of cable, or free-flying target launched from the ground or even from a drone . Another Twitter user, @maysam21901 , identifies the store as a TDU-11 thermal target, a Cold War-era U.S.-designed device that is based on the popular Zuni unguided rocket . For its target role, it has an additional flare to boost its infrared signature. As the same source points out, it’s compatible with an AIM-9 Sidewinder launch rail, and that seems to be what’s happening here. However, since it flies fairly straight and level, the TDU-11 is not necessarily a particularly challenging target, especially for a missile like the R-73 that can engage targets maneuvering at up to 12G. A diagram of a TDU-11B target rocket from a 1981 U.S. Air Force weapons manual., U.S. Air Force It’s not clear if this live-fire drill was part of a larger exercise or if it was even intended for public consumption, possibly during one of Iran’s regular wargames . Perhaps it was both an exercise and a display, especially bearing in mind it took place at such a low level, and apparently over members of the public; regardless, the video provides us with relatively rare imagery of one of Iran’s foremost air-defense fighters in action. The IRIAF MiG-29s, while old, represent a relatively potent capability for an air force that has been seriously hamstrung by sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear program, which has prevented the acquisition of any new fighter equipment for many years. The first batch of 18 MiG-29s was acquired from the then Soviet Union and began to be delivered to Iran in June 1990. Four additional MiG-29s were evacuated to Iran from Iraq in 1991, during Operation Desert Storm . The importance assigned to the Iranian MiG-29s is reflected in their role of air defense for the Iranian capital, Tehran, as well as escorting VIP aircraft. A demonstration of the capabilities of the Fulcrum and its primary short-range missile armament is important to ensure that this important part of Iran’s air-defense network still functions as advertised. An IRIAF MiG-29 at Mehrabad Airport, Tehran, in 2019. , DARA ZARBAF/Wikimedia Commons A live-fire exercise of this type, while hardly reflective of most air combat scenarios, provides valuable training to pilots and ground crew alike, with a rare chance to gain real-world experience of the end-to-end use of an infrared-guided missile. In particular, it’s noteworthy that the R-73 seen here is apparently not a special training missile but a live version, with a warhead as well as the usual motor and infrared guidance package, evidenced by the fairly massive fireball left on the target as the MiG peels away. The Archer has a rod-type warhead that includes a little over five pounds of high explosive. A bright fireball signals the demise of the target rocket., VIA TWITTER In this way, the pilot of the Fulcrum would have been provided with a level of realism impossible to replicate in a simulator, or with fully inert weapons which don’t launch off the rail and complete the engagement. Video of R-73 missiles fired from Russian MiG-31s during a training exercise: In this previous piece , you can read about how live-fire drills help to ensure both missiles and weapon systems work properly. But for Iran in particular, testing live missiles in this way has an added importance, since stocks of these weapons are now decades old and each missile only has a finite lifespan. The challenges this situation poses have been met head-on by the IRIAF in some intriguing ways, such as converting MIM-23 surface-to-air missiles as air-to-air weapons for the F-14, although the success of this and similar projects have been limited. With that in mind, tried and tested solutions like the MiG-29 and R-73, despite their advancing age, remain an important part of Iran’s ability to defend its skies, at least until any kind of new fighter equipment can be procured. Update, October 28: Kash Ryan , a close observer of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force has provided some further information on this type of live-fire demonstration, pointing out that the same combination of aircraft and missiles has performed similarly over Iran on at least one previous occasion. In 2019, the semi-official Tasnim news outlet reported that a “MiG-29 successfully intercepted and destroyed the missile fired from the F-5 aircraft by firing R-73 optimized missiles.” A photo released at the time confirmed a two-seat MiG-29UB was involved.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2021",India’s Stealthy Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Demonstrator Breaks Cover (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India’s unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) subscale drone demonstrator has appeared for the first time, revealing details of the flying wing design. The unmanned aerial vehicle, known as the SWiFT, is intended to serve as a proof-of-concept for a planned production combat drone , the Ghatak, which is reportedly being developed primarily as an unmanned strike aircraft. Photos and video of the SWiFT — which stands for Stealth Wing Flying Testbed — appeared yesterday, apparently showing taxi trials of the demonstrator drone that were likely conducted at the Chitradurga Aeronautical Test Range in the southern state of Karnataka, in mid-August. So far, there has been no official statement from the Indian Ministry of Defense or from the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the latter of which is in overall charge of the project. In terms of appearance, the SWiFT corresponds, broadly, with previous artist’s concepts and scale models of the drone and, more generally, of those of the Ghatak, with which it shares a flying-wing planform and an engine intake located above the forward fuselage. While the trailing edge of the drone is difficult to make out, it appears to have a classic tailless flying wing profile, providing an overall arrowhead shape, rather than the highly cranked wing found on other stealthy drones, such as the Northrop Grumman X-47B . Its trailing edge is less swept than other designs, like Russia’s S-70, for instance . In terms of size, the SWiFT is estimated to be around 13 feet long, with a wingspan of somewhat over 16 feet, and is thought to weigh approximately 2,300 pounds. The landing gear on the SWiFT is notably large, likely a reflection of this being essentially a scaled-down demonstrator for the Ghatak, rather than a full-size UCAV in its own right. Previous concept artwork suggested that the drone would incorporate some kind of internal weapons bay, although whether that has been included on this smaller demonstrator is unclear. An array of aerials and a sensor fairing can be seen on top of the fuselage, but these are certainly related to test work rather than being mission-optimized. The powerplant for the SWiFT is understood to be a Russian-made NPO Saturn 36MT , a small turbofan otherwise used to power cruise missiles. A view of the drone from the rear suggests that, unlike the Okhotnik in its current form , the design seems to include some kind of shrouded engine exhaust, which would reduce infrared and radar signature from this aspect. Low-observable exhausts can be among the most challenging aspects of stealthy designs like this. A rear view of the SWiFT technology demonstrator during recent taxi trials., Reach Defence/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP What little we know about the highly classified SWiFT and the Ghatak programs comes from unofficial Indian accounts, of which those from the Livefist defense website appear to be the most authoritative, but which are also based on off-the-record statements and involve a degree of speculation. Livefist first revealed the existence of the Ghatak program more than a decade ago and, in 2018, published images showing a six-foot scale model of the SWiFT at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, or IIT-K. This organization is responsible for much of the basic research into these flying wing drones, working alongside the government’s Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) in Bengaluru. Back in 2018, it was reported that the SWiFT could make its first flight in 2019 or 2020, but that has clearly been pushed back — a reflection, perhaps, of the considerable ambition behind a program that seeks to provide India with a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle with an emphasis on extended-range strike capabilities, a class of UAV beyond the reach of all but the leading aerospace powers. Livefist provided the following account of the kinds of mission that the future Ghatak drone might be expected to undertake: In the broadest sense, the Ghatak is intended to be an aircraft launched covertly near or over hostile territory, evading enemy sensors by virtue of its stealth, and destroying identified targets with air-to-ground weapons. In a broader sense, such stealth could also be used to gather electronic intelligence or covertly conduct airborne surveillance. Primarily though, the Ghatak is simply being developed as an unmanned bomber. It’s been reported that the planned Ghatak drone will be around eight times the size of the SWiFT, although it’s not clear if this is in terms of dimensions or weight. A wingspan eight times larger than that of the SWiFT would be in the region of 128 feet, making it roughly twice the size of the Okhotnik. Manufacturing a production drone so much bigger than this initial concept demonstrator would be an enormous undertaking just in terms of process, and there is no guarantee that the Indian aerospace industry will be capable of making that leap, at least without any kind of incremental steps along the way. Furthermore, the aircraft’s engine layout and its overall design are not evidentiary of that size of an aircraft. It is far more likely that Ghatak’s size will end up being scaled up accordingly, bringing it more in line with designs like the Okhotnik and other UCAV concepts, or even a bit smaller or even larger based on the IAF’s requirements. The Russian Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik., TV ZVEZDA CAPTURE Whatever its eventual size, the Ghatak project is clearly an enormously important one that could bring a significant regional and even strategic advantage to the Indian Air Force, if realized. Importantly, however, India is now playing serious catchup to China when it comes to developing combat drones of this type. China, which is increasingly becoming a major regional antagonist to India, already has developed the Sharp Sword stealthy flying wing UCAV, with later iterations of what the People’s Liberation Army designates the GJ-11 also featuring refined low-observable features , including a stealthier exhaust. This is not the only flying-wing combat drone developed by China, with the broadly similar CH-7 and the significantly smaller Tian Ying also having been offered for export, among others. With that in mind, India’s efforts to field a similar system may also simply be about achieving some kind of parity with China. The GJ-11 Sharp Sword stealthy combat drone., CHINA MILITARY Admittedly, India has so far made limited progress in fielding indigenous drones, armed or otherwise, with the country currently primarily fielding Israeli-supplied surveillance UAVs and loitering munitions . More recently, though, there have been concerted efforts toward developing more advanced homegrown drone technologies, including a loyal-wingman-type program, the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Combat Air Teaming System (CATS) Warrior. CATS Warrior is planned as part of a family of loyal wingman aircraft and associated systems, including small swarming drones, a remote weapons carrier launched by manned fighters, and even a drone control aircraft based on the HAL Tejas fighter jet , the Mothership for Air-teaming eXploitation (MAX). While the CATS Warrior also employs a stealthy design, the Ghatak, as planned, will apparently be larger by an order of magnitude — an altogether more ambitious undertaking. A full-size mockup of the CATS Warrior loyal wingman drone., Gagan/Wikimedia Commons In 2018, it was predicted that the full-size Ghatak could take to the air in 2024 or 2025, but that would seem unlikely if, in fact, SWiFT just commenced taxi trials. The video could be of a past test, as well, although a date stamp indicates it was from this summer. What’s more, with a stated ambition to develop all the critical technologies for the Ghatak in India, any potential for delay is significant. As well as limited experience of indigenous combat drones of any size, India has also never previously produced a stealthy aircraft either, with earlier plans to collaborate on a version of the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 advanced fighter having been abandoned . It had been predicted that the indigenous Kaveri engine would power the Ghatak, but with that powerplant having faced a catalog of problems and delays, a foreign engine might still emerge as a more realistic option. There also have been reports that France’s Dassault may provide assistance for the Ghatak, perhaps leveraging the work it has already done on its nEUROn stealthy combat drone demonstrator. The Dassault nEUROn stealth drone demonstrator., DASSAULT AVIATION Then there is the question of budget. While a flagship “Made in India” project like this one is clearly a matter of prestige, there is a real operational need for such a system. With the growing threat posed by China, a survivable unmanned attack aircraft with a robust range could be key in dismantling air defenses and hitting critical fixed targets during the opening stages of a conflict. There is no shortage of Chinese combat mass along India’s northern border and it’s only growing with each day . Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force is firmly focused on addressing its aging manned fighter fleet and its dwindling number of operational fighter squadrons . On top of that, the Ghatak could face competition for funds from the indigenous HAL Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft ( AMCA ) fifth-generation manned fighter program, which is also intended to feature stealth technologies. An apparent wind-tunnel model of the HAL AMCA fighter jet., Johnxxx9/Wikimedia Commons In 2018, the Ghatak program was said to be operating on “a shoe-string budget.” Two years later, it was said to be “a fully funded and sanctioned national defense project,” but the cloak of secrecy around the project means little more than that is known. Only time will tell whether the Ghatak project results in anything approaching an unmanned bomber. In the meantime, however, the start of meaningful tests of the SWiFT demonstrator is an important step toward establishing an indigenous capacity to develop high-end combat drones of the type now proliferating in China and elsewhere. Update, October 27: Since the publication of this article, we have reached out to experts in the Indian defense field to get their thoughts on the relationship between the SWiFT demonstrator and the production UCAV that is widely expected to follow it. The first notable point is just how secretive these projects are, with very little concrete information available in the public domain. As a result, there is plenty of rumor and conjecture overshadowing this work. A second key point about the expected size of the Ghatak UCAV is that the reports of a drone “eight times” the size of the SWiFT seem to be based on a simple misunderstanding. In fact, the production drone is likely to weigh around eight tonnes. Presuming this is a metric measurement, the resulting drone weighing 8,000 kilograms would be somewhat heavier than the Dassault nEUROn, and likely significantly smaller than the Okhotnik.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 2, 2022",Ukraine Strikes Russian-Backed Forces Using Turkish-Made TB2 Drones For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ukraine’s military has confirmed that it conducted its first ever strike using a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed drone yesterday. The TB2 destroyed a 122mm D-30 howitzer belonging to Russian-backed separatist forces in the country’s eastern Donbass region that Ukrainian authorities said was responsible for killing one of its soldiers and wounding another. This is the latest conflict to see the use of Bayraktar’s flagship product, which has already been employed to great effect in recent years by Turkish forces in Syria , by Libyan government forces in that country , and by Azerbaijan’s military against Armenian troops in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. In each case, these unmanned aircraft were instrumental in holding back the opposing side’s forces, if not outright defeating them. Video reportedly showing the strike had emerged online ahead of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine’s official confirmation. The General Staff’s post on Facebook about the incident included the same video clip, seen below, making clear that this was indeed footage of the TB2 destroying the D-30. Ukrainian officials had disclosed that TB2s were conducting reconnaissance flights in the Donbass region back in April. “From 14:25 to 15:15 [2:25 PM to 3:15 PM local time on Oct. 26], a battery of howitzers D-30 of the Russian terrorist forces fired on the positions of the Joint Forces in the area of the settlement of Granitne. Two servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were wounded during the shelling, one of them was killed,” according to the General Staff’s statement. “With the start of the shelling, a ceasefire was immediately demanded through the OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe] SMM – Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, and a note was sent through diplomatic channels. However, the occupiers did not react.” “In order to force the enemy to cease fire, [the] Bayraktar was used by the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the statement continued. “The unmanned aerial vehicle did not cross the line of contact and destroyed one gun of the crew of the Russian occupation forces with a guided bomb. After that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.” The statement from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not say exactly what kind of “guided bomb” had been used in the strike. However, the Turkish-made MAM-series of small laser-guided bombs, which Ukraine has also acquired, has been the most common weapon employed by TB2s in other conflicts in recent years. A Ukrainian TB2 drone with MAM-series precision-guided munitions seen under its wing., Ukrainian MoD It’s not entirely clear many TB2s are currently in Ukrainian service, but the first examples were delivered in 2019 . The country’s Air Force and Navy now both operate small fleets and are looking to buy dozens more . Bayraktar is now in the process of establishing training and maintenance facilities for the drones in Ukraine and the Ukrainian government is interested in producing or at least assembling them locally. Yesterday’s strike came after separatist forces accused Ukrainian forces of crossing the established line of contact in the Donbass region, which forms a de facto border between areas those groups occupy and the rest of the country. Officials in Ukraine denied those claims. Both sides routinely accuse each other of violating existing ceasefire agreements. A map from the OSCE’s SMM in Ukraine that shows, among other things, the estimated line of contact in the Donbass region as of Oct. 26, 2021., OSCE The use of the TB2 has added a new layer to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which has dragged on for years now. Ostensibly local separatist groups have occupied areas of the Donbass since 2014, the same year that Russia illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimea region . Those separatists have strong links to Russian intelligence agencies and receive direct support from the Russian military. Though the Kremlin denies this is the case, there is clear evidence that many separatist units are simply Russian forces deployed inside Ukraine. It’s not at all hard to understand why Ukraine has acquired TB2s and, if anything, it’s somewhat surprising that it took so long for a strike involving one of them to occur. These drones have been proven extremely effective against very similar forces in equally similar scale conflicts since 2019. That year, Libya’s internationally-recognized and Turkish-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) employed TB2s to blunt an offensive led by Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA). The LNA receives support from Russia, among other international benefactors. Then, last year, Turkey used its own TB2s, among other assets, to stymie Russian-backed forces in Syria’s Idlib province. In 2020, Azerbaijani TB2s were, along with various Israeli-made loitering munitions, also known as suicide drones, were instrumental in that country’s victory over Armenian and Armenian-backed forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. In that conflict, in particular, the Bayraktar were employed to destroy large numbers of enemy artillery emplacements, just like the strike in Donbass yesterday, as well as tanks and other armed vehicles. For Ukraine, as with Libya and Azerbaijan, the TB2 offers a very effective and relatively low-cost way to generate precision airstrikes against various types of targets, as well as to conduct long-endurance reconnaissance and surveillance missions. Russian-supported separatists in Donbass have significant armor and artillery assets that otherwise present real challenges to Ukrainian troops, especially if a larger round of fighting in the region were to erupt. There were concerns just earlier this year that such a crisis could be imminent as Russia flooded parts of its territory opposite Ukraine’s borders, as well as Crimea, with thousands of troops equipped with tanks and heavy artillery, among other assets. At the same time, Russia has, from the very beginning , heavily employed electronic warfare systems in the conflict in Ukraine that could present hurdles to operating TB2s that other countries have not necessarily faced when employing these drones, which are generally configured to use line-of-sight control links. Bayraktar only unveiled a version with a longer-range satellite communications system last year. A map the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense previously released showing the locations of Russian electronic warfare systems in Donbass between 2016 and 2018., Ukrainian MoD Russia’s military has substantial air defense assets that it could bring to bear, as well. At the same time, Bayraktar’s drones have been responsible for the destruction of Russian-made air defense systems, especially Pantsir-S1 point defense systems , in other conflict zones. No matter what, armed TB2s conducting strikes, a capability that Ukraine has now demonstrated, still presents an additional hurdle to separatists and their Russian partners. If Ukrainian forces now feel able to conduct these kinds of strikes more regularly, it would also raise questions about the potential for escalation in kind on the part of Russian-support forces. The operational capability the TB2s offer could be a point of leverage for officials in Kyiv in any future negotiations with the Kremlin about a potential resolution to the conflict, as well. The drones are indicative of steps the Ukrainian government has taken in recent years to try to bolster its ability to challenge future surges in Russian aggression, both militarily and diplomatically. This includes Ukraine securing an agreement with the United States last year that finally gave it the ability to employ its Javelin anti-tank missiles against Russian-backed forces, something that had previously been prohibited under the terms of the sale of those weapons, as well as its continued interest in joining NATO . Turkey and the United States are both NATO members. “Ukraine…has a right to decide its own future foreign policy, and we expect that they will be able to do that without any outside interference,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said during a visit to Kyiv just last week. “We will continue to do everything we can to support Ukraine’s efforts to develop the capability to defend itself.” However the conflict in the Donbass region continues to evolve, it will be especially interesting to see what happens immediately now that the Ukrainian military has now shown that is both able and willing to employ its TB2 drones to respond to certain ceasefire violations by Russian-backed forces.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 29, 2021",This Is Our First Look At A Two-Seat Variant Of China’s J-20 Stealth Fighter (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have emerged from Chengdu Aerospace Corporation’s plant and flight test airfield that appear to show a J-20 in yellow primer paint with a two-place tandem cockpit and an elongated canopy to enclose it. If the images are indeed legitimate, the appearance of this J-20 variant — often referred to as the J-20B, J-20AS, or J-20S — wouldn’t be much of a surprise, as China’s military-industrial complex has been hinting at its development in an increasing manner for some time now. In fact, we covered its potential development just this summer. Author’s note: See updated with new images and video at the bottom of this post. This new J-20 variant would give China something the United States and other competitors do not have — a stealthy high-performance tactical jet that has two heads in the cockpit instead of one. Why the two-person crew concept is becoming a big deal again is that two people are better able to exploit the enormous information advanced sensors and networking, as well as close proximity to the enemy, that a stealthy advanced fighter with good endurance can provide. In doing so, they can become force multipliers, helping to enable other, less capable assets by working as a ‘quarterback of sorts of the localized tactical air battle. Having another brain available to help best employ the J-20’s own weapons is also a plus, especially as its arsenal expands and its missions continue to evolve. Via SDF, QianCDer There are also clear training advantages of having a two-seat variant of any aircraft. Even if the ‘J-20B’ is not configured with full controls in the rear cockpit, crews can still benefit from exposure to tactical training and basic flight operations via the second seat accommodation. @白龙_龙腾四海 & @机外停车RABBIT VIA WEIBO Beyond this more basic function, and especially important to this development, the emergence of manned-unmanned teaming and loyal wingmen drones will be greatly enabled by a second person acting as a ‘mission commander’ of sorts, who helps control unmanned systems and coordinates tactics with them near the forward edges of the fight. This is precisely where the J-20 was designed to be employed. Even some competitive disadvantages in unmanned autonomy and networking capabilities could be at least partially offset by having another crewman in the cockpit who is focused on the implementation of manned-unmanned teaming tactics. Regardless, China is working hard on its own artificial intelligence-related air combat initiatives , both for use in the cockpit and in unmanned platforms , as well as loyal wingman programs . China’s FH-97 is a knock-off of Kratos’ XQ-58 Valkyrie and it, too, is designed to have loyal wingman capabilities. , Chinese Internet via twitter Dark Sword, which has been in development for years, is thought to be a high-performance and stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle that could be an ideal candidate for teaming with the J-20. , Chinese Internet As to the question of whether the images of a two-seat J-20 are real or not, we cannot say for certain, but they do fit well with an established pattern of ‘leaks’ on the internet in China that show increasingly more detailed images of new aircraft developments out of Chengdu. In fact, these images are very similar to the first glimpses we got of the J-20. At the time, many said they were fakes. They, and many in the U.S. government, were soon proved quite wrong when it came to their chronic underestimation of Chinese engineering capabilities and the level of espionage at work that helped it advance so quickly. Still, these images could easily be altered. We have seen some great fakes before . The timing is key here, though, as two-seat J-20 concept art has increasingly been present at major events, including China’s big air show and arms expo in Zhuhai that just wrapped up earlier this month. Concept images of ‘J-20Bs’ have become increasingly common amid growing talk about a two-seat variant of the stealth fighter., Chinese promotional materials For all these reasons, it really isn’t as much a question of if we are getting a ‘J-20B,’ but when . It will be interesting to see if this new variant also has other major refinements to the core J-20 design. We have seen the aircraft evolve over the past decade on many fronts, and it is known that its avionics have progressively improved. The advent of a two-seater would be a great time to introduce more major modifications, some of which are thought to be on the way . So, we’ll have to see if more images emerge of this potentially impactful two-seat J-20. If these are indeed the real McCoy, we will likely see higher resolution images of the jet in question very soon. Update, October 27: A new photo and video showing the two-seat variant of the J-20 has emerged and appears to provide our best look at the aircraft so far, all but confirming its existence.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2021",Here’s Why This New Mysterious Air Force Drone Contract Is A Big Deal (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has awarded drone maker Kratos a contract to develop and flight test an unmanned aircraft as part of the secretive Off-Board Sensing Station program , or OBSS. Details about the OBSS project remain limited, but the effort has a clear, overarching focus on affordability. There are indications that this reflects a broader shift in how the Air Force views so-called “attritable” platforms , something Kratos has previously told The War Zone that it is already well prepared for on the design and manufacturing fronts. The Pentagon first announced that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) had awarded Kratos the OBSS contract late yesterday in a daily contracting notice . The deal has a base value of just under $17.7 million, with an additional option that, if exercised, would add another $31.4 million. That option would also extend the contract’s period of performance from 12 months to 27 months. The existence of the OBSS project — and that Kratos was among the contenders — first emerged in August, and you can read more about what could be gleaned about this project at that time in the War Zone ‘s initial reporting . It’s not clear how many other companies submitted proposals or if any of them will also receive contracts. An XQ-58A Valkyrie, another advanced unmanned aircraft that Kratos has previously supplied to the Air Force, during a test flight., USAF “This contract provides for a design, development, and flight demonstration in an open architecture aircraft concept to achieve the goals of rapid time-to-market and low acquisition cost,” according to the Pentagon’s contracting announcement. A press release from Kratos, which says that OBSS has a focus on manned-unmanned teaming and that AFRL is conducting the project as part of its “Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP) technology maturation portfolio,” describes its design as follows: The OBSS vehicle is intended to be an affordable, highly modular conventional takeoff and landing jet-powered UAS [unmanned aircraft system]. The Kratos OBSS solution incorporates innovative manufacturing techniques that enhance its ability not only to provide significant performance for sensor extension missions for manned jet aircraft, but also will accommodate significant offensive weapons volume to also act as a weapons bay extension for manned aircraft. OBSS is a new addition to the Kratos family of low-cost Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP) designed to employ weapons, sensors, and other effects that generate affordable, force multiplier combat power with a forward force posture. This description is well in line with various publicly known projects the Air Force is working on with regard to advanced manned-unmanned teaming capabilities. The best known of those efforts is AFRL’s Skyborg program. The central goal of that effort is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) driven “computer brain,” along with a suite of associated systems, which will be able to fly semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drones networked with manned aircraft, and potentially fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). In December 2020, the Air Force announced that it had hired Kratos , along with Boeing and General Atomics, to build unmanned aircraft to carry the Skyborg suite of systems. At least one modified Kratos UTAP-22 Mako unmanned aircraft, a loyal wingman-type design , has already been employed in Skyborg-related testing. The service has been experimenting with Kratos’ stealthy XQ-58A drones in other capacities, including as aerial communications gateways , as well. The War Zone has reached out to Kratos to see what, if any, relationship OBSS may have to its work under Skyborg. Separately, earlier this month, the Air Force announced a test of “a low-cost attritable aircraft fuselage and wings design” that “aimed to compare the structural strength and stiffness … using novel manufacturing processes versus a traditional aerospace M&P [Materials and Manufacturing Processes] approach.” Kratos is involved in that program, which is called the Design for Manufacture of Attritable Aircraft Primary Structure (DMAAPS), together with A&P Technology, Hawthorn Composites, and the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI). The Air Force Research Laboratory is in charge of DMAAPS and has said it is related to the ACP effort. One of the structures produced as part of the DMAAPS program., USAF One of the wings produced for the DMAAPS program., USAF “Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACPs) will play an increasingly important role in various air force missions,” Doug Meador, the ACP Air Vehicles Portfolio manager within AFRL’s Aerospace Systems Directorate, said in a statement. “The main tenets of ACPs are autonomy, affordability, speed of design and build, and mission effectiveness. DMAAPS directly addresses affordability and speed of design and build, which are critical to our ability to develop these systems in large numbers and present a military challenge to peer adversaries.” No pictures or artwork related to the OBSS program has publicly emerged so far. At the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference in September, Steve Fendley, President of Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division, confirmed to The War Zone that it is not related to any of its existing designs, but could not provide any additional details. This would make sense given that we now know that this new unmanned aircraft can take off and land conventionally, unlike Kratos public offerings, all of which are launched via catapults and have parachute recovery systems . “We’re on pins and needles, obviously hoping that we’re selected,” Fendley added at that time. “It’s a game-changer.” Though we still have much to learn about OBSS and its goals, as well as Kratos’ submitted design, it is obvious that affordability is a key consideration for the program. Beyond that, interestingly, both the Pentagon’s contracting announcement and Kratos’ press release do not use the word “attritable,” despite the Air Force and this company using that term to describe OBSS in the past. The War Zone has typically defined attritable as a platform — whether a drone or something else — designed to balance capabilities and low cost in such a way that commanders would be comfortable employing it in higher-risk scenarios that might otherwise preclude the use of something more costly and technologically advanced. As AFRL’s Doug Meador noted earlier this month with regards to the DMAAPS program, the Air Force has, at least in the past, viewed attritable designs as critical to allow for the acquisition of advanced aircraft and munitions in the kinds of volumes that would be necessary to sustain future conflicts, especially high-end fights against near-peer competitors, such as Russia or China. Otherwise, attempting to do so, especially during a crisis, could be cost-prohibitive and overly time-consuming. OBSS, like DMAAPS, appears to be, at least in part, about crafting new and improved design and manufacturing processes with an eye toward high-volume production, as well as developing the unmanned aircraft itself. Kratos’ Steve Fendley, at right, shakes hands with U.S. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. James Adams at AeroVironment’s booth at the Navy’s League’s Sea Air Space conference in 2019. AeroVironment, another unmanned systems company, has been a major partner with Kratos on a number of projects., AeroVironment “Expendable means, and I think this is consistent between the Air Force and industry, expendable means I’m going to fire it one time or launch it one time and it’s going to do one mission, its finished,” Kratos’ Fendley told The War Zone in September. “Attritable means it’s going to have some limited life or limited number of missions, whether that’s one or 10 or a hundred, I don’t know. Exquisite means I really want it to be around forever.” “I would say that the programs we’ve been on and the requirements we’ve seen, there typically is a desire, at least, that says we would like this to be good for x number of hours or x number of missions,” he continued. “So, kind of a threshold, it’s that it needs to be able to support this many missions or this many hours.” This understanding would fit well with the Air Force’s unexpected decision to send its first XQ-58A Valkryie to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base earlier this year after just a handful of flights. Kratos had originally developed the Valkryie for the Air Force under the Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program. Novel design and manufacturing concepts were important components of the LCAAT effort, in addition to flight testing an attritable design. At the same time, at the Air Force Association conference, representatives from another aviation company had told The War Zone that they were seeing a shift in the Air Force’s language away from attritable and toward affordable. When asked about this, Fendley said he had not observed this trend himself, but that it was his opinion that it made good sense to focus on providing certain capabilities affordably, rather than putting the primary emphasis on the total service life of a low-cost platform. “If we develop, and let’s just pick Valkyrie, we develop an attritable aircraft, that means that after some number of missions or flights they would accept if the airplane didn’t come back,” he explained. “I can’t design an airplane to be good for five flights, right?” Fendley also called into question whether you’d ever want to design aircraft with these kinds of parameters in mind. “So, over time, this, let’s just use attritable, let’s say bring an attritable system that’s good for 50 missions. Guess what happens over time? Boy, budgets are getting tighter and tighter, we want it to last for 75 missions now. Darnit, we didn’t design it for that,” he said. The War Zone has previously raised many similar questions with regard to the Air Force’s proposed Digital Century Series concept , which had envisioned the rapid development and acquisition of small batches of combat aircraft with relatively short expected service lives. Public discussion of this idea, including by the Air Force itself, has dropped off significantly since the departure of its chief advocate, former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Will Roper, in January. Then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Will Roper at a past Air Force Association conference., USAF “Affordable is dependent on the application, but that kind of makes more sense,” Fendley said on the sidelines of the Air Force Association conference. “If the requirement is affordable, I would say it’s very clearly then the government is stating there must be a design that costs” a certain amount and that “they would have to define what that number is.” “So you have to design to cost, which is one piece, then you look at it and say, okay, we’re designing to cost here, but we just figured out that for one more dollar we can add 20 percent to this part of [the] performance, we should do that,” he added. “And, oh, by the way, we can subtract two percent on this performance parameter and save 20 percent of the cost of this production item, so we should do that.” Fendley made clear that the performance per cost metric is something Kratos’ design and manufacturing teams are “laser-focused on.” Though the company has described many of its products, such as the Valkyrie, as attritable, its statements have often focused on how it is keeping actual unit costs low. For instance, it has said in the past that one of its goals has been to drive the price of a single XQ-58A down to around $2 million as production of those drones ramps up. Low-cost, but still very capable jet engines produced by Technical Directions Inc. (TDI), a division of Kratos, a been a major part of the company’s efforts to reduce the price points of its products. A U.S. Air Force XQ-58A., USAF Leveraging new digital engineering capabilities, a growing general trend in the military aerospace industry , to help accelerate design and production processes, while also keeping costs low, is another part of this puzzle. “Kratos’ industry-leading digital engineering (DE) framework for high-performance jet UAS will be used to develop, mature, leverage, and integrate system-ready technologies and supplement its DE framework with prudent early ground and flight demonstrations and experiments,” the company’s OBSS press release said. Fendley had previously told The War Zone that there was still a critical need to balance work in the virtual space with real-world prototyping, something that other companies have espoused , as well. Overall, Fendley said at the Air, Space, Cyber conference that he believes Kratos’ core business philosophies will provide advantages and different opportunities over its competitors in the future. This would be especially true if U.S. defense spending flatlines or even contracts in the coming years, as there have been many indications that it will. He added that much of how Kratos, a relatively small company, operates has been driven over the years by the need to maximize what it can do with its own internal funding, rather than relying on U.S. government contracts. “Keep an eye on affordability and how affordability plays into the whole unmanned aircraft arena,” he said. “I think that’s such a key element, and we’re so focused on that, I think it’s very important.” All told, we will hopefully continue to learn more about OBSS and Kratos’ new drone design as time goes on now that this contract has been awarded. In the meantime, it is increasingly apparent that this program is indicative of emerging discussion within the Air Force about affordability and what that means, especially for advanced unmanned aircraft. Updated 8:35 PM EST: Today’s daily contracting announcement from the Pentagon includes an entry showing that General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) has now also received a contract as part of the OBSS program. Its initial award for the first 12 months of work is valued at nearly $17.8 million, with its potential 15-month-long option period being worth almost $32 million. As with Kratos’ deal, GA-ASI’s contract is “for the design, development, and flight demonstration in an open architecture aircraft concept to achieve the goals of rapid time-to-market and low acquisition cost.” Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor, has also reported that the Air Force plans to pick one company to advance to a follow-on flight demonstration phase after the initial contract period.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 23, 2021",America’s Troubled New Aircraft Carrier Will Finally Go On Its First Deployment Next Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The much-delayed maiden deployment for the U.S. Navy’s new aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford is now scheduled to take place next year, four years later than originally planned. The nuclear-powered vessel is the lead ship in a new class of supercarriers, four of which have been ordered , with the three additional units now under assembly. A decision on the configuration of a fifth is due next year. With a whole range of advantages promised over the current Nimitz class carriers , the Navy is keen to get the first of the Ford class into operation, but it has been a long wait, with many setbacks due to the inability of critical systems to function as intended. “Everything is on track,” Rear Adm. Gregory Huffman, the commander of Carrier Strike Group 12, recently told USNI News in an interview . Huffman, who will lead the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group on its first deployment, added: “We’re still looking to get out as scheduled after the six-month availability. No big showstoppers that they’ve come across at all. So very, very positive news coming from the captain and from the shipyard. And then as we come out of that, I think we’re going to be set very well to get back in that operational mindset and get ready for the deployment.” An F/A-18F from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23) flies over the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) during earlier trials., U.S. Navy/Erik Hildebrandt According to USNI News , the new carrier is now “in the middle of the last maintenance phase” before its maiden deployment. Exactly when this will take place next year is unclear. In an unusual measure, Huffman himself went aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford for the 18-month post-delivery test and trials period, completed earlier this year. USNI News reports that having the CSG commander and his staff on board the ship “allowed the ship’s crew to get a head start on functions ranging from communications and operational drills to determining where the strike group staff would sleep.” Rear Adm. Gregory Huffman, Commander, Carrier Strike Group 12., U.S. Navy The sometimes-painful journey made by the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) toward being declared ready for its first deployment has included delays relating to its nuclear powerplant . The advanced new Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), both absolutely fundamental to its successful operation have also had repeated issues . Other shortcomings have related to the radar , and even a lack of technical data to reliably launch and recover fighter jets in all their configurations. In the meantime, many of these issues have seen improvement or been solved outright, with fixes announced for the powerplant , successful tests of EMALS and AAG, and confirmation that all the technical data for aircraft launch and recovery had been gathered . An F/A-18 recovers on USS Gerald R. Ford using the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), as part of the ship’s post-delivery test and trials earlier this year., U.S. Navy There have also been difficulties with the advanced magnetically operated and software-controlled weapons elevators, which are designed to bring ordnance to the flight deck more quickly. Huffman told USNI News that the elevators have now completed 15,000 cycles “in all conditions” and that the expectation is that all 11 will be fully functional by the time USS Gerald R. Ford completes its current maintenance phase . There have been other signs of progress, as well. In June, The War Zone reported on shock trials for the USS Gerald R. Ford , off the Florida coast, these being a critical test for any new warship, providing insights into how the ship may cope with a hostile attack. You can read more about these trials here . The shock trials were a success , with no major flooding, fires, or equipment failures, despite the best efforts of 40,000 pounds of explosives detonated in the water around the ship. Huffman said that the radar, EMALS, and AAG performed well during the shock trials, with all of them still running “immediately after each of the shocks.” As well as introducing new technologies, the fact the USS Gerald R. Ford will add another carrier to the Navy is significant in itself. In recent years, the carrier force has found itself under intense pressure, which has led to extended periods at sea as well as so-called double-pump deployments in which operational cruises are made back-to-back . This has been driven by a dramatic increase in demand for carriers to support U.S. military operations and foreign policy goals around the world, combined with a significant number of flattops undergoing maintenance and major overhauls. The entire situation has been declared unsustainable by some . With little sign that demand for carriers is going to diminish, the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford — followed by the other members of its class — should provide much-needed respite to the carrier force. The USS Gerald R. Ford should help take the pressure off the other carriers and crews, not just by bringing a new hull into the fleet, but possibly due to its supposed ability to generate a greater number of sorties than a Nimitz class vessel over the same period. The USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), on the left, and the Nimitz class carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) transit the Atlantic Ocean in June 2020., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Riley McDowell The Ford class brings a range of features together — the EMALS, AAG, revamped maintenance spaces, new flight deck configuration, and advanced ordnance elevators — with the aim of achieving a roughly 30 percent increase in sortie generation rate. However, that promise has yet to be properly explored, with a full air wing yet to operate aboard the new carrier. While Carrier Air Wing 8 (CVW-8) has embarked, most recently in spring this year, it was a reduced-size composition that practiced integrated carrier strike group operations. Embarking a full-size air wing is clearly now a priority, to explore how the carrier and its subsystems actually work in a fully representative, sustained, on-cruise, operating environment. Beyond that, there will be further challenges ahead, including integrating carrier-based drones as part of the Navy’s pivot toward an air wing in which unmanned platforms feature much more prominently . Even the deployment of light fixed-wing drones would be possible with the capabilities of the Ford class. Its EMALS and AAG are capable of launching and recovering these more delicate aircraft. Still, it will not be one of the first carriers capable of deploying the MQ-25 Stingray tanker . That will require a number of additional modifications and testing. A Boeing-owned MQ-25 drone transfers fuel to an E-2D in a recent trial. The Ford class has been designed from the outset to accommodate new types of unmanned aircraft., U.S. Navy “The Ford is designed with more of that modular mindset,” Huffman told USNI News . “So it’s easier to adapt and flex as new equipment comes online, as we start looking at what new air wing composition is going to be and new technologies are presented.” As modular and advanced as it may be, the USS Gerald R. Ford will not be able to operate the Navy’s newest strike fighter, the F-35C Lightning II , either. Doing so will also require a number of upgrades and trials. With that in mind, there are likely to be other hurdles that need to be overcome in the long process toward the Navy fielding a new supercarrier design. But with a date, however approximate, now set for its maiden deployment, the countdown to the USS Gerald R. Ford joining the fleet in a deployable sense is well and truly on. Once that happens, the Navy will be much better positioned to make a call on whether to buy more of the extremely costly Ford class, or instead look at other, more affordable options , such as the light carrier concepts that continue to attract official interest.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 29, 2021",China’s Massive New Maritime Patrol Ship Looks Like A Cruise Ship Inside,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s civilian Maritime Safety Administration recently commissioned into service what is the country’s largest non-military patrol vessel, the Haixun 09 . The ship, which is expected to displace around 13,000 tons with a full load, has a number of advanced features, including a highly computerized propulsion system and a robust maritime data center. Interestingly, pictures of its interior show that many spaces are unusually luxurious, being more akin to what one might expect to find on a cruise ship , or even a floating hotel , than a maritime patrol vessel. The Haixun 09 was commissioned on Oct. 23 at a ceremony in the city of Guangzhou in southern China’s Guangdong Province. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation designed the ship , which is just over 541 feet long and around 67 and a half feet at its widest, and construction began in May 2019. The vessel, which has no heavy weaponry but is equipped with water cannons, was launched in September 2020. It also has a helipad and hangar at the stern. https://youtube.com/watch?v=q7qpw5ZnCB0 “Haixun will help strengthen maritime traffic control and emergency support, ensure safe and smooth shipping, and protect the country’s maritime interests,” Cao Desheng, the Director of the Maritime Security Administration (MSA), said at the time of the ship’s launch. “It will also be an important tool for emergency management and cooperation in the global maritime security sector. The plans also call for the expansion of the maritime patrol fleet capable of long-range operations on the high seas by leveraging technological innovation.” The ship can reportedly remain at sea for up to 90 days without needing to refuel or resupply. It is said to have a maximum unrefueled endurance of at least 10,000 nautical miles while cruising at 16 knots, with a maximum speed of around 25 knots. Haixun 09 reportedly has what Naval News has previously described as an “intelligent engine room system” to help the crew manage both the ship’s propulsion and onboard power systems. The vessel is designed to use low-sulfur fuel and has a system to help scrub its exhaust of nitrogen oxides, which can have harmful environmental effects. Reports also tout Haixun 09’s heavily computerized navigation and mission systems. These are said to include a link to China’s Beidou satellite navigation network and an array of communication and information-sharing systems in the ship’s maritime data center. Interior shots that have emerged online — and look likely to have been taken either shortly before or during the commissioning ceremony — show the bridge featuring a number of large, wide-area digital displays. One photograph shows a digital map board somewhere in the ship’s mission spaces. There is also an auditorium-like space that could be used as a briefing or conference area, as well as a command center, with desks fitted with computers, a main conference table, and a very large projection screen. A view of Haixun 09 ‘s bridge., Chinese internet Chinese internet The digital map board., Chinese internet What appears to be a briefing area on board Haixun 09 ., Chinese internet Those images, and others, show the ship’s interior has a very civilian feel to it, with some spaces being quite well furnished, and even pretty ornate in some cases. This is not necessarily what one would expect the inside of a government law enforcement vessel to look like. For instance, portions of the bridge and the edges of the digital map board have what looks to be faux wooden trim, a feature seen elsewhere around the ship as well. A number of rooms, including medical bays, have what appear to at least be imitation hardwood flooring, as well.

The MSA’s need for a ship of this size, to begin with, is also not entirely clear. The MSA, which came into being in 1998 through a merger of the existing China Ship Inspection Bureau and the China Port Supervision Bureau, reportedly has around 1,300 vessels in total. However, with the commissioning of the Haixun 09 , it still only has four with displacements greater than 3,000 tons, all of which it acquired in the past two decades. The most obvious use for a ship of Haixun 09 ‘s size and reported capabilities is to help assert China’s expansive blue-water maritime territorial claims, especially in the hotly disputed South China Sea. Some of MSA’s other larger ships have conducted patrols in the South China Sea in the past. At the same time, the Haixun 09 is configured in line with the MSA’s primary missions of maritime search and rescue, pollution control, monitoring maritime traffic in shipping lanes, and conducting offshore safety inspections. As already noted, it is not armed with heavy weaponry. This has raised some questions, even from Chinese state media, about its exact utility in helping to enforce the country’s territorial claims and otherwise advance its national interests. Beyond more assertive enforcement actions, especially with its interior, the ship could be used as a flagship of sorts in a soft power role, including in the aftermath of disasters or other humanitarian crises, as well as more general international engagements. Some of the MSA’s larger ships have conducted similar missions in the past. For example, the 3,000-ton displacement Haixun 31 visited Hawaii as part of an engagement with the U.S. Coast Guard in 2013 and took part in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014. The more luxurious interior spaces inside the Haixun 09 could be especially useful when making port visits, as they would be ideal for photo ops while hosting local dignitaries. The ostensibly civilian nature of the ship would be more fitting for engagements in places where the government in Beijing is seeking to expand its political and economic influence, rather than simply show military force, especially as part of its controversial Belt-and-Road Initiative . All of this would be similar in some ways to how China has operated its Peace Ark hospital ship, which also has a very modern, civilian-style interior look, despite belonging to the People’s Liberation Army Navy. Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University’s Institute Defence and Strategic Studies, told the South China Morning Post , or SCMP, that much of the modernization and expansion of MSA’s fleets has been driven in no small part by a rivalry with the China Coast Guard, rather than operational requirements. China’s current Coast Guard was created in 2013 by merging four previously separate organizations , notably not including the MSA. Since then, it has also been acquiring cutters with displacements of over 10,000 tons as it has taken on a more aggressive role in asserting Chinese territorial claims. In 2018, the China Coast Guard also was placed under military control, with MSA remaining under civilian control. Still “overall, this will lend to the effect of helping China assert its control in the area, including enforcing navigational rules vis-à-vis foreign vessels,” Koh told SCMP . It seems likely that the MSA’s plans for employing the Haixun 09 , with its oddly cruise-ship-like interior, will become much more apparent in the coming months.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2021",Ecuadorian Navy Sailing Ship Catches Low-Profile Narco Speedboat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a remarkable maritime incident, a three-masted sailing ship belonging to the Ecuadorian Navy successfully interdicted a low-profile vessel, or LPV, of the type typically used by drug smugglers to transport cocaine from Colombia to North America. The BAE Guayas , employed by the Ecuadorian Navy as a dedicated training ship, intercepted the high-speed LPV in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The incident took place in international waters between the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Colombia and Ecuador’s Insular Exclusive Economic Zone (IEEZ), which surrounds the Galapagos islands, on Oct. 22. In a statement , the Ecuadorian Navy confirmed that the LPV had been stopped together with its crew of three Ecuadorians and a Colombian. Ecuadorian Navy sailors examine the LPV after it was brought alongside the BAE Guayas. , Ecuadorian Navy “The apprehended citizens and the LPV are currently being transferred to the [Ecuadorian] mainland to be handed over to the relevant authorities, in order to carry out the corresponding legal procedures,” the press release added. The service did not announce what, if any, narcotics were found aboard the LPV, but these types of vessels are widely used for drug-running in the waters of the Pacific off the west coast of South and Central America. While some accounts describe the LPV as a “narco-submarine,” it should be noted that this one does not operate fully submerged. There are now various categories of LPVs , or self-propelled semi-submersibles (SPSS), with some being more visibly reminiscent of true submarines, while fully submersible drug submarines have been captured, as well. In his video explainer on the incident, H. I. Sutton, an author and an expert on undersea warfare , observes that the LPV “looks like a craft-made powerboat, but runs extremely low in the water, making it hard to detect.” “The cargo, likely cocaine of between 1.5 and 6 tons based on the imagery released, is carried in the forward hull, surrounded by fuel tanks,” Sutton explains. “The crew occupy the small cockpit at the stern, accessing the drugs via a tunnel. The three outboard motors provide reliable propulsion with built-in redundancy. These motors are ubiquitous in fishing fleets in the region and therefore are hard to trace.” At the time of the incident, the Guayas was taking part in a routine training activity. Over 257 feet long, the vessel is a school ship built in Spain, launched in 1976, and home-based in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Outwardly, the design of this vessel recalls the tall ships of the 19th century. Unarmed, the sailing vessel has a typical crew of about 120, including 80 cadets. The Ecuadorian Navy sail training ship BAE Guayas (BE-21) moored at Town Point Park in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2012., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist Seaman LaCordrick Wilson According to The Maritime Executive , the Guayas set sail from Guayaquil on Sept. 10, beginning a planned 70-day voyage to Peru, Panama, and El Salvador. The same source notes 147 crew members were on board, including a contingent of fourth-year midshipmen. It’s not clear if the LPV had been tracked long before its capture or if it was just a lucky find for the Guayas . According to the Ecuadorian Navy, other undisclosed units from the service took part in the action, which was coordinated with the Ecuadorian National Police and its department specializing in combatting organized crime, the ULCO , but no further details were provided. It’s also possible that agencies from outside Ecuador may have been involved in the mission, too. The Ecuadorian Navy also regularly works with U.S. Southern Command on counter-narcotics missions in Latin America. Whatever the case, the fact that a sailing vessel succeeded in capturing the high-speed LPV is impressive in itself. While the Guayas does have a supplementary diesel engine, it primarily relies on its sails and its performance would be greatly outstripped by the alleged drug-runners, whose boat was literally built for speed and stealth. That suggests the LPV in question may have broken down or was perhaps adrift for some other reason. There is also the possibility that other pursuit assets were involved, as well. The captured LPV with engines running. It’s unclear if the individual at the rear is one of the LPV crew or a member of the Ecuadorian Navy, but they seem to be handling a Jerry can. , Ecuadorian Navy While incidents involving drug-running vessels off the coast of South and Central America are not uncommon, the participation of a three-masted sailing ship is clearly out of the ordinary. On the other hand, only last week the Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso declared a state of emergency to confront drug trafficking and other crimes in Ecuador. As a result of that decree, the military and police are to step up their presence on the streets of the country, Lasso saying that drugs now represented the “number one enemy.” While this anachronistic maritime encounter is unlikely to be repeated any time soon, it goes to show that even unconventional assets can play a vital role in helping tackle the flow of narcotics in these waters.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Dynamics Land Systems, or GDLS, announced a formal partnership deal today with Epirus that will include work to integrate the latter company’s Leonidas high-power microwave weapon onto a variant of the 8×8 Stryker wheeled-armored vehicle . The two companies are pitching this combination to the Army, which plans to supplement its new gun and missile-armed short-range air-defense (SHORAD) Strykers with versions carrying directed-energy weapons. GDLS and Epirus’ proposal will be up against multiple laser-equipped designs , including one from a Raytheon and Kord Technologies team already undergoing Army testing . A GLDS press release says that its new Strategic Teaming Agreement with Epirus will also involve projects that could see Leonidas installed on “other manned and autonomous ground combat vehicles” in addition to the Stryker. GDLS produces a number of different unmanned ground vehicles, including the Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) series and the Tracked Robot 10-Ton (TRX), both of which the Army has been testing in various configurations. A rendering of the proposed Stryker variant equipped with Epirus’ Leonidas high-power microwave directed energy weapon., GDLS “General Dynamics Land Systems continues to evolve the Army’s largest and most reliable ground combat vehicle fleet with next-generation innovation and high-tech solutions,” Danny Deep, President of General Dynamics Land Systems, said in a statement. “This partnership with Epirus benefits the Army’s Stryker mobile SHORAD formations by offering cutting-edge, counter-electronics and counter-swarm capabilities.” “With Leonidas integrated into GD’s combat vehicle fleet, we are unlocking new SHORAD and counter-electronics capabilities to equip our warfighters with combat effective systems that dismantle the threats of today and tomorrow,” Leigh Madden, Epirus Chief Executive Officer, said. “I look forward to continuing our partnership with our General Dynamics Land Systems colleagues and know that, together, we can deliver on our customers’ mission needs.” High-powered microwave (HPM) directed-energy weapons, in general , are capable of disrupting or disabling electronic systems on a target — literally burning them up if the weapons are powerful enough. An HPM system’s power levels and how it focuses its beam have impacts on its range and ability to engage multiple threats at once, too. Epirus says that the technology behind Leonidas makes it particularly efficient through the use of “Artificial Intelligence-controlled solid-state power amplifiers to achieve extremely high levels of power output.” The company says this makes the core components of this directed-energy weapon highly scalable, as well. The Army’s interest in a Stryker-mounted directed-energy weapon system is primarily about short-range air defense, with a particular focus on unmanned aircraft, including countering attacks by large drones or even fully networked swarms of drones. Depending on the exact capabilities of the system it chooses in the end, it could potentially be employed against more traditional aircraft, as well as low-flying cruise missiles , and even threats on the ground. The Army previously acquired and field-tested a microwave weapon ostensibly designed for non-lethal crowd-control use. Thanks to a cone-shaped beam, HPM weapons have been touted in the past, as offering greater potential to counter drone swarms than lasers, which have to focus on one target at a time. “The fact that you can simultaneously track and immediately move to the next target to address not just a swarm, but multiple swarms, is a big advantage,” Don Sullivan, chief technologist of directed energy at Raytheon’s Missile Systems business, said in 2018 regarding an HPM system the company had supplied to the Air Force. At the same time, in the past, scaling down and reducing the power requirements for HPM systems to make them more viable — especially in a mobile, ground-based context — has proved challenging . Epirus’ website specifically says Leonidas has the ability to “startup in minutes, not hours,” in addition to having a relatively compact design. In the meantime, the Army is already testing a Stryker-mounted 50-kilowatt-class laser weapon system from Raytheon and Kord Technologies , which won a shoot-off earlier this year as part of what is officially known as the Directed Energy Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD) program. Raytheon says its weapon is also capable of engaging rockets, artillery shells, and mortar rounds, a mission set commonly referred to as Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM), in addition to drones and other low-flying aerial threats. The laser-armed Stryker from Raytheon and Kord Technologies the Army is already testing., Raytheon Northrop Grumman had initially been set to take part in that testing, but “was unable to meet the criteria agreed upon at contract award at the check-out,” the service told Defense News in August. The Raytheon-led team won a subsequent contract to supply three more laser-armed Strykers, enough to field an experimental platoon to explore concepts of operations using versions of these vehicles equipped with directed-energy weapons, in September. However, the Army has said that, when the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) turns the DE M-SHORAD program over to the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Missiles and Space, slated to occur sometime in the 2023 fiscal year, that it will hold a new competition, which could result in the selection of a final design for full-rate production. It’s worth remembering the Army has been experimenting with ground vehicles armed with lower-powered lasers, including a Stryker with five-kilowatt class type, for years now. As such, earlier this month, Lockheed Martin unveiled its own proposed laser-armed Stryker in anticipation of that future opportunity. The company’s Directed Energy Interceptor for Maneuver of Short Range Air Defense, or DIEMOS , is another 50-kilowatt-class laser weapon. An artist’s conception of Lockheed Martin’s proposed laser-armed Stryker., Lockheed Martin Whatever combination of systems the Army ultimately chooses as the winner of the DE M-SHORAD competition, a vehicle the service is tentatively calling the Guardian, will be part of a new array of layered air-defense capabilities the service is working on acquiring. Short-range air defense has been an area the Army and the rest of the U.S. military have seriously neglected in recent years, as you can read more about in this past War Zone feature . The growing threat of drones , in particular — as well as that of incoming cruise missiles — has reinvigorated interest in SHORAD in recent years. Small drones and cruise missiles represent very real dangers to American troops operating in combat zones abroad and to military facilities, critical infrastructure , and other targets off the battlefield, including inside the United States . Lower-tier, but still very dangerous unmanned aircraft and cruise missile capabilities are increasingly available to even nonstate actors , which only increases the potential for these kinds of attacks. The Army has already begun to acquire and field another M-SHORAD version of the Stryker, now dubbed the Marauder, which is armed with heat-seeking Stinger and millimeter-wave radar-guided Longbow Hellfire missiles , along with a 30mm automatic cannon. The service’s plan is eventually to field Marauders and Guardians alongside each other to provide complementary effects. Those systems could then be integrated into a broader air-defense network through the new Integrated Battle Command System . The development of other short-range air defense systems is going on elsewhere throughout the U.S. military, as well. This includes designs featuring directed-energy weapons, including both lasers and HPMs , with the latter category including the Air Force’s Tactical High-Power Operational Responder (THOR) demonstrator and a follow-on to that project, called Mjolnir , which was announced just in August. Most of these efforts are focused primarily on countering the expanding threat posed by unmanned aircraft. HPMs have been also suggested in the past as a possible close-in weapon system option for U.S. Navy ships . With regards to the Army’s DE M-SHORAD program, competition is heating up and looks set to present the service with an opportunity to decide whether an HPM or a laser best suits its requirements for a Stryker armed with a directed-energy weapon.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite more than a few hurdles along the way, the CH-53K King Stallion is now moving closer to meaningful operational service with the U.S. Marine Corps. Now that the heavy-lift helicopter has been loaded with Marines, we have a much better chance to compare some of the really tangible improvements it offers over its predecessor, the CH-53E Super Stallion , which entered service back in 1981, from the perspective of those who will ride aboard it. The photos in question were recently published by the U.S. Department of Defense and show Marines from 1st Battalion, 2d Marine Regiment, preparing to board and then in the cabin of a CH-53K at Marine Corps Outlying Field Atlantic, North Carolina, on October 20. The helicopter was assigned to Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron One, or VMX-1, which is charged with ensuring the King Stallion is ready for service and able to undertake all the missions asked of it. Marines with 1st Battalion, 2d Marine Regiment, board a CH-53K King Stallion assigned to VMX-1, at Marine Corps Outlying Field Atlantic, North Carolina, Oct. 20, 2021., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Damaris Arias In the meantime, VMX-1 has flown a first official fleet mission, too, completing the real-world retrieval of a U.S. Navy MH-60S Seahawk helicopter after a hard landing on a mountain ridge, last month, as you can read about here . The CH-53K will replace the CH-53E, and its job with the Marines will include moving heavy equipment and supplies from ship-to-shore in support of amphibious assault and subsequent operations ashore, as well as lifting troops, as we can see being evaluated during the trials in North Carolina. Overlooked by two crew chiefs, at least 26 Marines can be counted seated in the hold of the CH-53K, in two rows of 13, with their equipment stowed along the floor between them. The troops are fully equipped with loaded packs as well as individual weapons: almost all carry M4 carbines , together with the odd M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle , M32 grenade launcher , and M72 Light Anti-tank Weapon , or LAW. Marines seated aboard the CH-53K with the two crew chiefs at the front of the cabin., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Damaris Arias What we can see here is almost a full load of Marines for the CH-53K — bearing in mind the crop of the photo, it may well be that the helicopter had a full load of 30 troops, plus the two crew chiefs, not forgetting the two pilots up front. A schematic illustration of the CH-53K in troop transport configuration, with 30 seats along the cabin walls., Lockheed Martin The interior of the VMX-1 helicopter at Marine Corps Outlying Field Atlantic also seems to be better appointed than other CH-53Ks we have seen, however, with an apparent cabin cladding kit installed. The photo below seems to show the ‘Kilo’s’ interior without the cladding. The 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. David H. Berger, and 19th Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, Troy E. Black, ride in a CH-53K with VMX-1 commanding officer Col. Byron D. Sullivan, Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina, March 17, 2021., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Kathryn Adams Regardless of the details of the interior finish, compare the CH-53K loaded with Marines with a similar view of a legacy CH-53E, and you’ll get a sense of how much more fresh and uncluttered the CH-53K’s cabin is. Sikorsky took decades of lessons learned from operating the Super Stallions to inform the King Stallion’s design, including how the helicopter interfaced with its cargo and passengers. Marines with Battalion Landing Team 2d Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, await their departure on a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter to St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, to aid in the humanitarian effort for victims of Hurricane Irma in 2017. , U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Tojyea G. Matally Like the CH-53K, the CH-53E can actually carry more people, if need be. It too has normal seating for 30 passengers, but it can hold as many as 55 passengers with centerline seats installed. In that case, room for gear is almost nonexistent. However, the CH-53E cabin is a bit more cramped, even with the same number of Marines on board. That’s mainly the result of the CH-53K having a cabin that’s a full 12 inches wider, while the chaos of internal plumbing, ducting, and cables so evident in the CH-53E is neatly organized or entirely concealed in the Kilo. A Marine onboard the CH-53K, armed with the M38 Designated Marksman rifle., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Damaris Arias That extra-wide cabin means the CH-53K can accommodate full Transcom 463C cargo pallets and vehicles as large as the HMMMV internally. As an alternative, like the CH-53E, it can also be configured to move 24 litter patients or a Tactical Bulk Fuel Delivery System (TBFDS) to distribute fuel on the ground. While the inside of the CH-53K amply reflects the fact that the helicopter is basically a new design informed by its predecessor — at least compared to the CH-53E that was evolved from the earlier CH-53D — its load-carrying attributes don’t finish here. Thanks to three General Electric GE38-1B turboshaft engines developing 57 percent more horsepower than the CH-53E, the CH-53K will also carry significantly heavier loads externally and move them farther. While Lockheed Martin has boasted that the CH-53K can carry three times the load of a CH-53E, that’s based on the maximum vertical lift, so it doesn’t necessarily translate across the operating envelope. More meaningfully, the CH-53K is designed to carry up to 27,000 pounds externally over a distance of 110 nautical miles in a hot and high environment, compared to 9,654 pounds over the same distance for the CH-53E. A CH-53K lands at Marine Corps Outlying Field Atlantic, North Carolina, Oct. 20, 2021. , U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Damaris Arias However, the ability of the Kilo to reach its considerable potential has been continually challenged since an example was delivered to the Marines in May 2018. This has included a ruling that prohibited the helicopter from flying in dust clouds or so-called brownout conditions, due to concerns about engine performance in these circumstances. The last Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) report contained the stark warning: “CH-53K aircrew cannot realistically perform external cargo delivery operations.” You can read all about this issue in this previous article . Prior to that, there were problems with the engine and gearbox , both of which were solved in fairly short order. There have also been issues involving ingestion of exhaust gasses into the engines, deficiencies with the main drive shaft and tail rotor assemblies, and main rotor gearboxes that were prone to failure.

Pimentel III The latest Marine Aviation Plan, dated 2019, does not expect initial operational capability (IOC) until fiscal year 2024. At one point, it had been slated for 2015. Costs have meanwhile mounted, with the Pentagon 2021 fiscal year budget request outlining a unit cost of around $125 million . There have been concerns that this could affect the plan to ultimately acquire 220 of these helicopters. There has been good news, however, including a first export order , when Israel approved the purchase of the CH-53K in February this year. All in all, the CH-53K promises to overhaul the capabilities of the Marine Heavy Helicopter community, but the modernization has been a long time in the works, and the costs involved are eye-watering. Nevertheless, the CH-53K is a critical capability that was needed yesterday — and it looks like its fielding is finally on the horizon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",The Air Force Has A Plan To Make Jet Fuel Out Of Thin Air,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Every year, the U.S. Air Force buys billions of gallons of jet fuel at a cost of billions of dollars. It spends billions more to get it where it needs to go, including directly into aircraft on combat missions via aerial refueling tankers . Now, the service says that it has made significant progress in the development of a chemical process that could allow it to create the fuel it needs right out of the air, reducing its logistical burdens and environmental impacts. The Air Force Operational Energy office announced today that energy company Twelve , which has been working with the service on this technology, was able to produce viable jet fuel, known as E-Jet , from carbon dioxide in an experiment in August. The Air Force believes that Twelve’s current process, which also involves water and power from renewable energy sources, has the potential to be “highly deployable and scalable, enabling the warfighter to access synthetic fuel from anywhere in the world.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=vwgZC5I23-E “History has taught us that our logistics supply chains are one of the first things the enemy attacks,” Roberto Guerrero, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Operational Energy, said in a statement. “As peer-adversaries pose more and more of a threat, what we do to reduce our fuel and logistics demand will be critical to avoid risk and win any potential war.” “With carbon transformation, we are untethering aviation from petroleum supply chains,” Nicholas Flanders, Co-Founder and CEO of Twelve, added in his own statement. “The Air Force has been a strong partner in our work to advance innovative new sources of aviation fuel.” The underlying science behind Twelve’s carbon transformation process is not new. In the 1920s, German scientists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch invented what became known as Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis . This process has been improved upon since then and remains in use today, including to produce fuels for the U.S. military. “Fischer-Tropsch certified synthetic fuels are approved as a ‘drop-in’ fuel for each specific aircraft, first commercially, and then by the U.S. military and the aircraft’s associated system program office,” according to the Air Force. “The highest blend currently certified is a 50/50 blend of FT synthetic fuel and petroleum fuel.” However, “most synthetic fuels, which are created by a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen known as syngas, are produced through burning biomass, coal, or natural gas,” the Air Force notes, meaning that fossil fuels are still required. “Twelve’s technology eliminates the need for fossil fuels, producing syngas by recycling CO2 captured from the air and – using only water and renewable power as inputs – transforming the CO2.” The benefits of a potentially simpler, carbon-neutral synthetic fuel manufacturing process could be enormous from a cost perspective, as well as an environmental one. Even a slight reduction in the cost per gallon of fuel could generate significant savings for the Air Force. In a 2019 op-ed for Defense News , Deputy Assistant Secretary Guerrero highlighted how the Air Force flies regularly flies around 800,000 sorties annually and burns some two billion gallons of aviation fuel in the process. The exact amount of fuel the service uses and how much it spends to buy what it needs every year fluctuate due to changes in operational requirements. However, it is always a multi-billion dollar expenditure . In its budget request for the 2022 Fiscal Year, the Air Force included nearly $8.2 billion for fuels of all kinds, which could include aviation gas, as well as other things like gasoline and diesel for ground vehicles. If the service could trim just five cents off the cost of every one of the two billion gallons of aviation fuel it buys every year, that would equate to a savings of $100 million. It’s not just the cost of the fuel itself that’s at issue, though. The Air Force also has to pay to get it to units that need it, including in warzones. Beyond how much it can cost to push fuel to forward-deployed elements, there can also be significant risks incurred in doing so. “The Air Force must use a combination of trucks, aircraft, and ships to ensure fuel is delivered to meet warfighter demand. However, many areas of operation cannot always easily reach traditional access points of the supply chain, particularly during conflict,” according to the Air Force. “At the height of the war in Afghanistan, attacks on fuel and water convoys accounted for more than 30% of casualties.” A convoy of trucks carrying fuel for US forces in Afghanistan in 2011. , DOD The Air Force says that the infrastructure associated with Twelve’s carbon transformation process is not only potentially viable for the production of synthetic fuel at scale, but that it might be possible to craft a version of the system that is readily deployable. This, in turn, could reduce the need to physically deliver large amounts of fuel to units in the field, cutting costs in the logistics chain, as well. If Twelve’s carbon transformation technology is as capable and scalable as the Air Force clearly hopes it is, it could be game-changing for the service. One would imagine that the rest of the U.S. military would be similarly interested in the process, especially if it could produce a wide variety of fuels. Twelve sees an obvious potential commercial market for E-Jet fuel, as well. Fuel demands across the U.S. military are only increasing, as are the potential dangers to the platforms used to bring it closer to the front lines. The risks to supply chains would only be magnified during higher-end conflicts, especially against near-peer adversaries, such as China or Russia. The Air Force, along with its sister services, are well aware of these realities and are in the process of exploring various potential options to provide battlefield power in the future, from hydrogen fuel cells to small mobile nuclear reactors to even just sending it via a microwave beam from one point to another. The Air Force has already acknowledged some potential pitfalls in the carbon transformation concept that will still need to be overcome. The biggest of these will be supplying the power necessary to run the fuel production process, especially in a battlefield context. Since Twelve’s process also demands a ready supply of water, which will be another critical resource in future conflicts. Twelve has pointed to the idea of being able to extract water from the air, as well, which would eliminate the need to supply that separately. Pulling water out of the air has also been suggested as a possible way to provide water for drinking and other purposes in remote and austere environments, including during combat operations. This, of course, could be a difficult proposition in environments where the amount of ambient water in the air is limited. In addition, while this concept would help reduce the Air Force’s reliance on fossil fuels, the synthetic products from Twelve’s process are still hydrocarbon fuels, though the company says they are very clean-burning . Carbon emissions continue to be a factor in global climate change, an issue that is also of growing concern to the U.S. military, as well as the rest of the U.S. government . “Exacerbated by climate change, extreme weather events are increasingly damaging infrastructure, disrupting supply chains, impacting force readiness and operations, and contributing to humanitarian crises and instability across the globe,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement yesterday accompanying a new Pentagon report on the security implications of global climate change. “Climate change is also shaping our strategic interests. Competitive advantage in the future will go to those who can fight and win in this rapidly changing strategic and physical environment. “ Still, with the potential to save the service hundreds of millions of dollars and ease ever-growing logistic concerns, it is not surprising that the Air Force is very interested to see if this technology can be made to work as advertised. The first phase of this project is set to end in December, after which the plan is to begin actively working on scaling the process up to demonstrate its ability to make significant quantities of fuel. It will be very interesting to see where Twelve, in cooperation with the Air Force, takes this project next. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 1, 2021",This Is Our First Look At The USS Connecticut After Its Underwater Collision,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the Navy’s prized Seawolf class nuclear fast-attack submarines, the USS Connecticut (SSN-22), slammed into a “submerged object ” on Oct. 2, 2021. After it was clear that the submarine was stable and its reactor was safe to operate, it limped from the South China Sea, where the collision reportedly occurred, back to the sprawling U.S. naval facility in Guam, where the damage would be assessed and the accident investigated. The Navy has remained very tight-lipped about what it thinks Connecticut collided with, or if it has any idea what it was at all. You can read about some of the possibilities here . As of today, no pictures of the stricken submarine have surfaced, which is somewhat remarkable, although there have been plenty of misrepresented images floating around social media that claim to show the damage. Now, The War Zone has obtained satellite imagery that shows Connecticut tied up to the pier in Guam — the first public image of the submarine since the incident. The high-resolution satellite imagery was taken on Oct. 20, 2021. It shows two submarines in port in Guam. One, which is moored on the western pier near the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land (AS-39), appears to be undergoing some maintenance. The white tarp-like object on its bow is not an uncommon sight for submarines in port. While it is tough to tell, compared to the other submarine moored direct across the harbor to the east, its beam looks smaller and it does not appear to have a pumpjet propulsion system. These factors, and its general shape, indicate that this is most likely an improved Los Angeles class (688i) boat. The Seawolf class, with its 40-foot beam, is wider than America’s other two fast-attack submarines — the Los Angeles class being 34 feet wide and the Virginia class being 36 feet wide. Also, this submarine features a pumpjet instead of a propeller. The Virginia class also is also equipped with a pumpjet. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The placement of the two submarines currently moored at the U.S. Naval base in Guam., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION In addition, we confirmed with the Navy’s Pacific Fleet that the USS Connecticut is indeed still in port in Guam. With this in mind, one of the two submarines must be Connecticut , and the one on the eastern pier is almost certainly the boat in question. What’s most interesting about this image is that, while the resolution is limited, there doesn’t appear to be absolutely massive damage to the Connecticut (or the other submarine, for that matter), nor is there any type of unique support infrastructure around an area of the submarine that may be damaged. We can see nothing on the sail or the top of the bow and sonar dome that would indicate a major impact. Based on the limited information that the satellite photo provides, it seems more likely that the collision occurred well below the submarine’s surfaced waterline, such as on the bottom of its hull. This may preclude the possibility of a full head-on collision, or one from above, in which the sail bore the brunt of the impact. USS Connecticut underway on the surface. , USN Once again, these are superficial observations based on very little information at this time. So take them as such. Light damage to topside areas would not be visible in the photo. Regardless, it’s good news that the entire front of the submarine is not pulverized as we have seen in past underwater collisions . As for the status of the Navy’s response to the mishap, Cdr. Cindy Fields, a spokesperson for the Submarine Force of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, told The War Zone the following: “Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is the lead for assessing damage of the submarine. NAVSEA is providing an assessment team responsible for coordination of the damage assessment and development of repair recommendations, which is forwarded to the Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and NAVSEA for approval. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard is designated as Naval Supervising Authority for assessment and subsequent repairs. USS Emory S.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A British Royal Navy Wildcat maritime helicopter has fired a Martlet missile for the first time while deployed operationally. In its initial air-launched application, the lightweight missile is primarily intended to protect the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers from attacks by swarms of small boats , as well as other maritime targets, part of a wider effort to reintroduce carrier strike capabilities that had been lost when the United Kingdom retired its last previous flattops . The live firing campaign, conducted in the Bay of Bengal as part of the Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) deployment centered around the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , is an important milestone for the Royal Navy as it overhauls its surface strike capabilities to address new kinds of threats. The debut operational firing of the Martlet Lightweight Multirole Missile, or LMM, took place on October 16 but was only confirmed by the Royal Navy today. A Wildcat HMA2 from 815 Naval Air Squadron’s 219 Flight, deployed aboard the Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender as part of CSG21, fired the missile, which successfully hit an inflatable “ killer tomato ” target. The target destruction is seen on a display in the cockpit of the Wildcat., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP After transiting the Strait of Malacca, CGS21 had entered the Bay of Bengal earlier this month and then took part in the Maritime Partnership Exercise, or MPX2021, alongside the U.S., Australian, and Japanese navies.

Currently, however, Navy Lookout reports that a maximum of 10 missiles can be carried by each Wildcat, due to “aerodynamic issues.” The Navy has confirmed that Martlets are available for all Wildcats deployed within CSG21, part of what it describes as “the ring of protective steel” around the Queen Elizabeth. In addition to the Type 45 destroyers HMS Defender and Diamond , Wildcats are embarked on the Type 23 frigates HMS Kent and Richmond . This, however, is not the first time that a Wildcat has test-fired a Martlet. That happened off the coast of Wales in April/May last year, but that was trials work, rather than a test by a frontline squadron under operational conditions. Before that, the LMM had also been tested aboard the Royal Navy Type 23 frigate HMS Sutherland , in trials that you can read more about here . A combined LMM missile launcher and 30mm cannon installed on a Type 23 frigate., CROWN COPYRIGHT The Wildcat HMA2 is the Navy’s standard multirole helicopter for operations from frigates and destroyers, replacing the previous Lynx , from which it is derived. As well as anti-surface warfare, its missions include force protection, counter-piracy, and antisubmarine warfare. The Wildcat carries a WESCAM MX-15Di turret with electro-optical and infrared sensors to detect threats, including vessels with small radar and thermal signatures, including against severe background clutter. The turret’s laser designator then guides the laser-beam-riding Martlet to its target.

Data provided by the manufacturer asserts that the basic LMM has a range exceeding 3.2 nautical miles, although launching it from a moving helicopter could potentially extend this. According to the Royal Navy, targets can be acquired by the Wildcat at ranges of between four nautical miles and around 0.25 miles. A Martlet-armed Wildcat overhead a Type 45 destroyer in the Indian Ocean., Crown Copyright The Wildcat from HMS Defender launches a Martlet on Oct. 16, 2021., Crown Copyright Martlet also allows the Wildcat to engage certain aerial targets , primarily unmanned aerial vehicles, and other maritime helicopters. This is likely to be very much a secondary role but could still be important, especially considering the relatively limited air defenses installed on the two Queen Elizabeth class carriers, a subject that we have examined in the past . The two Wildcats in involved in the first operational Martlet missile trials in the Bay of Bengal. The farther aircraft is fitted with the Leonardo Weapon Wing., Crown Copyright Martlet has been prioritized so far under FASGW, a reflection of the particular concern given to high-speed maneuvering targets, but the same program is also introducing another missile to the Wildcat. This is the Sea Venom , which has already undergone live-fire trials with manufacturer MBDA, and which is a high-subsonic sea-skimming missile intended for use against larger warships and shore-based installations such as missile batteries and radar stations. The Sea Venom has an imaging infrared seeker, a two-way datalink, and a semi-armor-piercing blast/fragmentation warhead. The Wildcat will be able to carry up to four Sea Venoms or a mix of Sea Venoms and Martlets. A Wildcat from HMS Defender conducted a series of flying sorties in the Indo-Pacific region with Martlet wings attached last August., Crown Copyright Compared to Sea Venom, Martlet is a lower-cost weapon optimized for use against asymmetric targets such as small high-speed naval craft, suicide boats , or other unmanned surface vessels, including those operating in swarms — the kinds of threats that are becoming an increasing concern for navies operating in the Persian Gulf , off the Gulf of Aden, and elsewhere. The Royal Navy, for its part, is already well aware of the potential hazards posed by small boat swarms, with direct experience of the threat in the Persian Gulf, where it has provided commercial shipping with close escorts . In the Pacific, China is making no secret of its interest in being able to field swarms of drone boats, demonstrating that these capabilities sometimes associated with non-state actors are also available to high-end adversaries . This could be of particular relevance to the Royal Navy as it becomes ever more active in the Asia-Pacific region. The effort to get Wildcats armed with new missiles has seen delays and cost increases . However, with this latest successful live-fire trial in the Indian Ocean, the Royal Navy has successfully demonstrated an important new capability that’s directed squarely against a type of threat that’s only likely to proliferate in the years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 11, 2021",Green Berets Hone Their Destruction Of Enemy Air Defenses Skills For A Peer Conflict,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers, more commonly referred to as Green Berets, knocked out simulated enemy air-defense assets during a recent exercise. They also sabotaged a mock port facility and collected intelligence on stand-ins for strategic targets, such as radar sites and missile silos . This training highlights how the U.S. military’s entire special operations community has been refocusing on preparing to support future higher-end conflicts , including against potential near-peer adversaries such as Russia or China, after decades of conducting low-intensity counter-terrorism missions. Elements of the Army’s 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) carried out these missions in support of conventional troops from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, during a recent rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, La. This appears to be the same exercise that, in September, saw mock enemy troops — also known as the opposing force (OPFOR) — use missile and machine-gun armed unmanned ground vehicles for the first time, as you can read more about here . Personnel at the JRTC also played the role of local partner forces working with the Geren Berets. British Army soldiers from 4th Battalion, The Rifles — a specialized infantry unit — presently assigned to that service’s Special Operations Brigade , were also attached to the American special operations force for this exercise. “That really replicates what we’ll see in future conflicts with multinational partners and our allies overseas in combat,” Maj. Marshall McGurk, a Special Operations Training Detachment (SOTD) Advanced Operational Base (AOB) Lead Observer Controller/Trainer at JRTC, said in a video about the exercise, seen above, that the Army released. For the Green Berets, this exercise at the JRTC was “a little bit of a departure from what we’re used to due to the fact that this under the auspices of LSCO, which is large scale combat operations,” Sgt. Major Afshin Aryana, from Company A, 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group, said in his own video interview. The 7th group has a regional focus on operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, which has typically seen them support allies and partners conducting counterinsurgency and counternarcotics missions . The group has also deployed detachments in support of operations in Iraq , as well as the recently concluded campaign in Afghanistan , on multiple occasions over the past 20 years. “Our mission here is to support 3rd of the 101st in large scale operations, largely initiated with our ability to take out integrated air defense systems [IADS],” Aryana explained. “The IADS fight was a huge part of it.” “As you have these systems all around the battlefield, essentially, the radar in one area can pick up targeting for a rocket in another area,” he continued. “Unless you destroy the main system, the hub, at the end of the day, no aircraft can fly into that area.” What appears to be a surrogate for a Russian-made truck-mounted 30N6 Flap Lid fire control radar that was part of the recent exercise at the JRTC. Variants of the Flap Lid radar are components of the S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. , YouTube screen capture In spite of its name, the 101st Airborne Division is actually an air-assault-focused unit that specializes in operations using helicopters. “And an airborne unit that has planned an air assault, like the 101st, if we can’t get those birds on the ground, then the mission is already lost,” Aryana said. The issue of enemy air defenses, both in terms of ground-based assets and hostile aircraft , is something that has been largely absent in U.S. counter-terrorism operations in the past two decades. Those missions have, with some exceptions , generally taken place in environments where the airspace above has been entirely permissive. This is something that simply cannot be guaranteed during future conflicts , especially potential large-scale fights against major adversaries, such as China or Russia. In addition, suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, or SEAD/DEAD, are missions that are typically assigned to friendly aircraft, which face increasing risks themselves . In recent years, it has only become more and more apparent that other assets , including special operations forces on the ground, will be important pieces of the SEAD/DEAD puzzle in the future. Back in 2017, retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Don Hampton, who has been referred to as the deadliest F-16 pilot, said as much in an interview with The War Zone ‘s own Tyler Rogoway: There are ways in and around those [air defense] systems and I will go back to one of my life-long premises—anything that kills a SAM or part of a SAM can be a Wild Weasel. So it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s me in a tactical airframe. It might be special forces teams on the ground blowing up radars. It might be naval warships standing offshore if they’re within range of their guns and just blasting the hell out of them. Aryana also pointed out that commanders would not be able to take for granted their ability to regularly communicate with Green Berets in the field in future large-scale operations. This would be especially true with regard to Operational Detachment Alphas (ODA), or A-Teams, the smallest Army Special Forces units, operating deep behind enemy lines. “Just the simple writ large understanding that that is no longer on the table,” he said. A map showing part of the operations area for the recent JRTC exercise that Green Berets from the 7th Special Forces Group participated in., YouTube screen capture “We have to give good commander’s guidance for ODAs to operate for multiple days without constant guidance or real-time updates, to develop their own intelligence, and to be a more self-sufficient organization,” the Army Special Forces soldier continued. “This leads us and the ODAs to learn what we can and can’t do and it teaches a decentralized sense of leadership.” After helping to neutralize the mock air defenses during the recent JRTC exercise, the Green Berets turned their attention to other missions, including hampering enemy activity or otherwise collecting information about what those forces might be doing. “We did this through things such as reconnaissance missions on strategic assets like radar and missile silos and whatnot,” according to Aryana. Aryana’s mention of “missile silos” here is particularly interesting. There have been multiple reports this year that about indications that the Chinese military is dramatically expanding its silo-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) forces. Another “one of those [strategic assets] there was this port that belonged to the people of [the fictional country of] Arnland, but the [OPFOR] had taken control of that port,” Aryana said. “We couldn’t destroy the port, because we didn’t want to destroy critical infrastructure for the people in Arnland, so we ended up just disabling it for a period of seven days, which stopped the flow of equipment and resupply to the enemy.” A Green Beret sets simulated demolitions charges to disable a piece of electric infrastructure at a mock port during the recent JRTC exercise., YouTube screen capture Of course, U.S. Army Special Forces units, as well as other American special operations forces, have trained over the years to gather intelligence, support the targeting of, and otherwise conduct raids on strategic targets and critical infrastructure, and put those skills to use in actual combat. A prime historical example is the Great Scud Hunt , during which coalition special operators sought out Iraqi Scud ballistic missiles during the first Gulf War in 1991. At the same time, many of these skills have not been core features of U.S. special operations missions in recent decades. What Aryana described here falls very much in line with a recent push within the Army’s Special Forces community, in particular, to be prepared to carry out these kinds of tasks, including covert and clandestine reconnaissance and intelligence gathering on such sites in contexts short of an actual conflict. An unclassified Army white paper released last year outlined plans to establish contingents of Green Berets dedicated to performing these kinds of tasks, which the service described broadly as the “Hard Target Defeat” mission, something you can read about more here . All told, the missions assigned to the Green Berets from 7th Special Forces Group during this exercise at the JRTC very much reflect what American special operations forces could be called on to do, together with other coalition partners, in a future high-end conflict.

Juan Rivera,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Life On The High Seas Aboard A Tin Can Destroyer During The Cold War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In my previous article, I described two intense days frantically hunting a Soviet submarine in the Strait of Gibraltar back in 1967. I was a low-ranking sailor serving aboard the USS Steinaker — the World War II-era Gearing class destroyer I sailed on for two years. Now I’d like to describe some of our other high-seas adventures, and what life was like living aboard a destroyer in those days. Like A Living, Breathing Thing A warship like Steinaker is never left unattended, or completely powered down. Walking around the ship, you would always be aware of machinery noises, and powerful exhaust fans venting hot air from deep in the ship’s engineering spaces. You could always feel small vibrations, as if the ship was alive, and in a way it was. The ship was powered by high-pressure superheated steam produced by two large boilers that were heated with a thick, foul-smelling type of oil called bunker fuel. The boilers were housed in their own space. When I was a new crewman, I got a tour of the boiler room. I remember a crewman leaning over near a steam line and lighting his cigarette by touching it to the line. The heat was intense in that compartment — in some areas up to 150 degrees. The inlet end of the exhaust fans was in the boiler room, and you could stand under them to try to cool off. The steam was piped to the engine room, where it turned two turbines and probably other equipment such as generators. It would then be returned to the boiler room to be reheated. What we usually think of as steam is really water vapor suspended in steam. Steam is a dry colorless gas. When you heat water to the boiling point, it changes state from a liquid to a gas, and you produce steam, but it doesn’t contain much energy. If you lower the temperature even slightly, it will change states from a dry gas back to a liquid again. To make the steam useful, the energy needs to be greatly increased by raising the temperature and pressure. That way it can release tremendous energy while turning the turbine and still remain a dry gas. USS Steinaker, its bow soaked—a normal occurrence., USN The ship produced 60,000 horsepower from two steam lines that were about six inches in diameter. It’s hard to wrap your mind around the power of high-pressure superheated steam. You can’t see steam. That makes a leak extremely dangerous. A leak would create a huge white cloud of vapor in the compartment, but the actual steam leak could be many feet away because the white cloud would only form once the steam had cooled and the water began changing state from a gas to microscopic liquid droplets. When looking for a steam leak, the boiler room folks were taught to wave a broom in front of them as they slowly approached a possible source. When they waved the broom in front of the leak it would cut all the bristles off, leaving a stump at the end of the pole. Nowadays, U.S. Navy destroyers are powered by large gas-turbine engines — just like the engines you might see on a large passenger jet but designed to turn a shaft instead of producing thrust. Gas turbines take up much less space, and the ship should be able to get underway from a cold start faster than a ship that had to fire up its boilers and slowly produce steam. The cost of running a gas turbine-powered ship must be impressive. Bunker fuel is cheap, but jet fuel is not. Clearly, in the last five decades, just about everything on a destroyer has changed — propulsion, weapon systems, sensors, navigation, and communications. But some things have not. The mission to project power and protect the sea lanes remains the same, and destroyers are still making cruises to the same destinations we did. The ocean remains the same, and the Navy is still faced with the same design issue — how do you cram a lot of sailors into a relatively small ship? Challenging Living Conditions In the picture above, Steinaker is sailing at a moderate speed through calm seas. I spent half of my two years on Steinaker living in the forward berthing compartment, which was located about where you see “863” painted on the bow. In heavy weather, the bow constantly rose up (as in the photo) and then plunged into the next wave and was often completely submerged. Tons of water rolled across the deck, slamming into that forward gun mount, and was blasted high into the air where it landed on top of the 03-level where the bridge and Combat Information Center (CIC) were located. More about that later… Sea states are described using the Beaufort Scale, which runs from zero to 12. In the picture, I would say this was maybe three on the scale, and that’s probably a stretch. Here are the descriptions of sea states three and twelve, for comparison: Author My point is that destroyers can be rough-riding ships, even in calm conditions, but why do I mention sea state 12? Because Steinaker went through a hurricane while I was aboard. Ships do not normally steam into the middle of a hurricane, but hurricane paths are difficult to predict, and Steinaker wasn’t the first ship to relocate to avoid a hurricane only to have the storm change course and run it down. In our case, I remember being tied up at a small pier in Key West when we got the word that a hurricane was building in intensity and heading right for us. Ships do not want to get caught in shallow or restricted water when a big storm is headed their way, so we departed to the east to get some sea room, only to have the storm unexpectedly veer to the east and run us over. I remember the anemometer in Combat (the Combat Information Center, or CIC) hovering around 75 knots and occasionally peaking at around 100 knots. I honestly do not remember it being that big a deal. Of course, that was over 50 years ago, and I am reminded of the definition of “the good old days” — a good imagination and a bad memory. Maybe I was terrified while trapped in a windowless compartment listening to tons of water landing on top of us and hanging on for dear life. All the chairs in CIC had seatbelts for a reason! We had a public address system on the ship called the 1MC. I just Googled it and found that “MC” is short for “Main Circuit.” Anyway, it was common to hear, “Now hear this. All hands stand clear of the weather decks while maneuvering at high speed through heavy seas.” I took this picture with my little Minox camera showing why you would want to heed that warning: A view of the ocean from the Steinaker in rough weather., Courtesy of the Author This picture was typical of what I remember — the sea was always a dull gray and so was the sky. The only time in the two years I saw blue water was on a short trip to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The water in the bay was beautiful and the bottom was white sand — that visit is for another time. … There were 21 of us housed in the forward berthing compartment, which was the size of the average apartment’s living room. Each person had a rack that consisted of a tubular aluminum frame with a canvas sheet stretched tight inside it. On top of the canvas was a thin mattress enclosed in a “fart sack,” which was like a large pillowcase. Racks were stacked three high and lined up in rows. Some rows were freestanding, and others were attached to the bulkheads. I was in the middle between the lower and upper racks. That was a plus, as I was less likely to break my neck when I was tossed out of my rack and landed on the deck during a storm. My row of racks was attached to the bulkhead with hinges, and the outer side was held in place with a chain at each end. When I lay flat on my back, with my elbows at my side, I could touch the top guy’s mattress with my fingers. Between me and the bulkhead was a high-pressure steam line that ran from the boiler room to the engine room. It was insulated with asbestos and was about six inches in diameter. At my feet was a small fan. At night, when I managed to get to sleep, I occasionally stretched and stuck my toe into the fan. Enlisted berthing racks similar to those found on Gearing class destroyers, NHHC Below the bottom racks were small lockers where we stored all our possessions. If that bottom rack was occupied you could not get to your locker. That often happened since we were not all in the same watch sections — half were on watch while the other half slept. So, by necessity, you might go on watch, leaving your small “douche kit” or a paperback book laying on your rack. Our chief would make regular visits into our compartment and collect any loose items he could find and lock them away in a locker he had commandeered. Each week there was a reckoning, and we were given two hours of extra duty for each item he collected. We soon caught on to the chief’s schedule — the reckoning always took place on Friday, so each Thursday we simply pounded the hinge pin out of his locker, redistributed his confiscated items, and then replaced the hinge pin. The chief was no fool. He soon figured out our scheme and added a second padlock. He insisted that the compartment lights always be on during daylight hours, and no towels or other items could be hung from the racks above to block the light. He was beloved by all, and we all enjoyed his petty torments. Eventually, it came to the attention of the officers that some of us seemed to have a bad attitude, but I digress … Picture yourself totally exhausted from long hours on watch and trying desperately to get some sleep. In heavy weather the bow moved up and down about 15 feet as the ship plowed through the waves. One second you were pressed down in your rack as the bow rose up the side of a wave, and the next you were floating weightless as the bow dropped into a trough. The only way to not get tossed out of your rack and onto the deck was to sleep on your stomach and wrap your arms and legs around the rack’s frame like a spider. Each rack had some straps that you could use to tie yourself in with, but no one seemed to like those. You could also get a shipmate to tip your rack way up and shorten the chains, so you were wedged in, but then you could not get out by yourself, and that could be a big problem. To these many layers of misery, you need to add the constant sound of the entire compartment going underwater and the noise of the sonar, which was not far below us. Actually, after a while I found the sonar restful. About once every five seconds, it made the sound you hear in every submarine war movie you’ve ever seen. Because my rack was against the bulkhead, I could hear the sonar pulse and the echoes reverberating. At some point in my two years, I was also assigned to live in the aft berthing compartment. That was infinitely better, with no constant up and down motion, and at the far end of the ship from the sonar dome. A Huge Storm So far, I’ve just been bitching about normal everyday physical misery and discomfort. Now I want to talk about a storm ! You may be asking yourself, what is he going to whine about now? I’m sure destroyers are completely safe in all weather conditions, right? WRONG! For example, on Dec. 18, 1944, Task Force 38 was struck by Typhoon Cobra — sometimes called “Halsey’s Typhoon” — off the Philippines. The destroyers USS Hull (DD-350), Spence (DD-512), and Monaghan (DD-354) all capsized and sank. Seven hundred ninety men were killed and 80 injured. A destroyer can only roll so far before it capsizes. I think we came awfully close in the story I am going to tell you now. During my first Med cruise, we found ourselves tied up next to this magnificent cruise ship — the Michelangelo . I took this picture while we were both pierside in Genoa, Italy. That day, I had occasion to climb to the surface-search radar platform on the main mast with a shipmate to do some maintenance. I remember looking across at Michelangelo and commenting that it was so huge its main deck was higher than we were! The cruise ship Michaelangelo in Genoa, Italy, in 1966., Courtesy of the Author For an idea of just how tall the cruise ship’s hull was, this is what it looked like from where the author was viewing the ship., Courtesy of the Author On the seventh of April 1966, we both sailed out of Genoa and headed for the Atlantic. Steinaker was heading home. Five days later, on the morning of April 12, we both found ourselves mid-Atlantic and caught in a monstrous storm. The waves were massive — the size of large buildings. Steinaker had 60,000 shaft horsepower, twin screws, and twin rudders. Normally that would result in a very capable and maneuverable ship. But on that day we were completely helpless. One minute we would be pointed north, the next east – totally out of control. The extremely odd thing was that there was no wind to speak of and the sky was blue. Whatever had caused these massive waves was gone. When we were at the top of a wave, we could see for several miles. There was a large merchant ship about one mile away. I remember seeing it with the bow buried in a wave and the bronze propeller completely out of the water, turning slowly and with the sun glinting off the blades. Then we would slide down into a trough and lose sight of the ship. The next time we rose, that ship would be pointed in a completely different direction. We were both in big trouble. The little destroyer, seen here pre-upgrade, was not the smoothest ride when waves were present., USSSteinaker.org Above our bridge windows at the center, there was an inclinometer, which consisted of a curved glass tube filled with an amber liquid. Inside the tube was a black marble that was free to roll to the lowest point in the tube. The inclinometer was marked off in degrees. While sliding down a wave sideways, we took a starboard roll of 56 degrees. We had been told we would capsize somewhere around 65 degrees. Time seemed to freeze. Would we right ourselves or capsize? I can still see the little bubbles in the inclinometer tube in my head. With a 56-degree roll, it is easier to walk on the bulkhead than on the deck. These extreme rolls caused everything to go flying in every direction. I ended up on my butt, jammed up against the starboard bridge-wing door at the lowest spot formed by the sloping deck and starboard bulkhead, a pile of loose items in my lap. I remember straining my neck to look out the bridge-wing window. All I could see was a massive, malevolent wall of gray water that stretched up and out of sight above us. We never practiced abandoning ship, and I don’t remember ever seeing a life jacket. We had a few lifeboats that had to be lowered by pulleys. Totally useless in rough seas. It was clear we would all go down with the ship, or we would all make it out alive. It was just a question of physics. Meanwhile, on the Michelangelo , a huge wave came across the main deck and crushed a large section of the ship. Four passengers were killed, and 50 were injured. Damage was extensive. The ship managed to limp into New York Harbor. Michelangelo estimated the wave height at 18 meters, or 60 feet. Sebastian Junger described this storm in his book The Perfect Storm . This picture was shot from the bridge on Michelangelo during the storm. Remember that Michelangelo ‘s main deck was higher than the top of Steinaker’s main mast!, Courtesy of the Author Fine Dining, Destroyer Style Food on Steinaker was … different from my mother’s cooking. Sometimes the cooks would get bored and use food coloring to dye our scrambled eggs bright green. They also had a habit of serving really greasy slimy food when the weather was unusually rough. This leads seamlessly into another topic — sea sickness. But first, a bit more reminiscing. I do remember with great fondness the mashed potatoes. The potatoes were stored on the main deck in large cabinets with many holes for air circulation. In rough weather, they would get drenched with seawater, but the potatoes didn’t seem to mind. Mashed potatoes were universally good. I don’t think the cooks bothered to peel them, so there were small pieces of peel mixed in. I have to say that my favorite dinner ingredient was those mashed potatoes. In my previous article about the encounter with the Russian Foxtrot submarine, I described two very intense days, but there were also times when we were simply steaming independently through the night. During times like that, things were very relaxed. Most of the crew would be sleeping, and my world would consist of the three lookouts, the bridge talker, and whoever was in Combat with me. We were all on the same sound-powered voice circuit. I remember killing time by asking everyone a brain teaser, such as “I have ten coins in my pocket. They add up to sixty-four cents. What are they?” I’d also try to keep the lookouts company, since I’d been one earlier in my short career. If there was a surface contact on the radar I thought was visible, I’d give the lookout facing that way the bearing. The visible horizon from their height above the sea was about 13 miles to the top of another ship’s masthead lights. If you had very good eyesight, you could catch momentary glimpses of them. Anyway, occasionally, around three in the morning, the smell of baking bread would manage to work its way all the way to the top deck on the ship. One of us would go down and get a hot loaf of bread from the cook, along with a brick of butter and a jar of jam. Man, that hot bread tasted good! I look back on rare times like that with fondness. In general, food — especially perishable items — is loaded at the last minute before a trip. As a low-ranking crewman, I got tagged for all the working parties, and loading provisions was a common one. I remember bringing a large box of frozen beef on board. On the box it said, “USDA Good.” I’m not sure you can find that grade at the supermarket. It must be a special-order item. Milk deserves a special category all to itself. I think the Navy tried hard to always get the very freshest milk delivered to the ship at the very last minute. Once underway, one of two possibilities would happen — either we would run out, or the milk would start to go bad. In the latter case, the cooks would attempt to forestall the inevitable by using a series of clever steps. At first adding a bit of canned milk might disguise the taste and slightly brown color. Eventually, that would no longer pass the gag test, and they would have to add sugar, and maybe some powdered milk. Finally, it became a lost cause. Once the milk ran out, other substitutes were called for. We used to have those small cereal packs that had ten choices in a carton. For the Navy, they were packed for ocean shipment by covering them in some sort of tar paper and then vacuum-sealing them in aluminum foil. We must have gotten a batch that had been in storage since the Korean War, because the tar paper taste had permeated into the corn flakes. One morning, I remember eating a bowl of tar-flavored corn flakes with purple Kool Aid instead of milk. Steinaker, sometime after her 1965 fleet revitalization and modernization upgrade in 1965., NHHC Normally, the new watch section can go to the front of the chow line, eat, and then get up to CIC to relieve the watchstanders, who then have to rush down to get whatever is left. I remember arriving one day at the back of the chow line with a serious hunger. The evening meal was supposed to be chicken stew. When I arrived in front of the stew pot, I glanced inside. It looked like dirty dishwater with a few small flakes of meat floating in it. But at the bottom I could see a big juicy piece of meat. I told the cook I wanted that piece. An argument ensued, in which he wanted to know why I should get special treatment. I insisted and eventually he relented and granted my request. I soon joined my shipmates and began attempting to cut my big juicy piece of meat. I remember that my knife was serrated, and it seemed to be scraping off crumbs. I tried reorienting the knife to cut the meat with the grain, but it didn’t seem to have any grain. Eventually, I turned it over, and it had printing on it. I was trying to eat part of the cardboard box the chicken came in. The largest compartment on the ship was where we ate, and it sat directly over the midship berthing compartment. There were long tables that ran across the compartment from side to side. Food was served on metal trays like school kids probably use. The table edges were lined with a small lip to help keep the trays from sliding off in rough weather. That happened so frequently that we had a name for it — Chow Course. One particular evening, spaghetti was the main course, and I was hungry. I piled my tray high and then found a spot to sit at the end of a table. I sat my tray down, judged that the ship was fairly steady, and headed over to the bug juice dispenser. Just as I was headed back to my spot, the ship took a sickening roll that angled the table in a downward direction from my end. The tray started sliding — slowly at first. As it picked up speed, each person simply raised their tray off the table to let it pass. By the time it reached the other end of the table, it was moving! It hit that little lip like a ski jump, and it was catapulted into the air. As if in slow motion, it floated through the air without losing a single noodle and dropped straight down the hatch leading to the midship berthing compartment. Time stood still. … Imagine the boatswain’s mate’s surprise when a fully laden tray of spaghetti descended straight down that hatch and landed squarely on his head! That wasn’t the only unexpected roll, and, in short order, people were slipping and sliding all over the place. Noodles and spaghetti covered the deck. It started to look like a tag-team mud-wrestling contest with noodles instead of mud. Just another navy day at sea on a destroyer. Seasickness How’s this for a segue? When I first arrived on the ship, they were already preparing for my first Med cruise. One of the more common modes of entertainment on any ship is to mess with the new arrivals. I was almost immediately sent looking for a pot of “ relative-bearing grease.” I had been learning to fly before I joined the Navy, and I knew what a relative bearing was, so they switched to plan B: Speak constantly about how rough the ocean would be once we got underway. The goal was to get into the new guy’s head and get him worrying. Once you achieved that, nature would do the rest. I didn’t fall for that one either. I had experience. When I was a kid, my parents moved us to New York for a few years and I had ridden the Staten Island Ferry several times. I never got seasick. I was confident. The waterway leading from the Norfolk Naval Base to the Atlantic Ocean is long and complicated. This whole complex collection of waterways is called Hampton Roads. It takes quite a while to reach the ocean. Once underway, I spent the time convincing myself that the ship wasn’t any different than the Staten Island ferry boat. Eventually, we reached the ocean, and I realized I was in big trouble. It wasn’t long before I was leaning over the side and praying to the god of seasick sailors, O’Roark. That was the only time I lost my lunch, but I spent most of the remaining two years with a headache. There is a reason for that. Fear of the unknown and lack of experience are huge problems, but easily overcome. Once you’ve been through rough weather a few times, you will know what to expect. You can also take precautions. We used to eat an entire box of saltine crackers before heading out after being in port for a while. The theory was that having a big wad of cracker dough in your stomach instead of your stomach contents sloshing around with normal food would help. Comparison of two U.S. Navy Gearing -class destroyers from World War II and after the Fleet Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) I refit in the early 1960s. USS Sarsfield (DD-837) is shown on 23 August 1945, about three weeks after her commissioning. She features three 12.7-cm/38 twin mounts, 16 40-mm Bofors AA guns, and 5 53.3 cm torpedo tubes between the funnels. USS Rowan (DD-782) is shown circa early 1965, after her FRAM I refit: she has two 12.7-cm mounts, Mk 32 torpedo launchers, SPS-37 radar, ASROC launcher between the funnels, and a Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH) hangar and flight deck aft., Wikimedia This next story takes place somewhere in the middle of the ocean at night in rough weather. It makes no difference where it happened, and I tell it not to show that I had a cast-iron stomach or was tougher than everyone else, but to prove there is a very strong mind-over-matter aspect to seasickness. It was a miserable night. The ship’s motion was nauseating in the extreme. There is a best course to sail for the smoothest ride, but that may not be the direction you need to go. As seems to be the case in my stories, I was on the surface-search radar and responsible for preventing collisions with other ships. I don’t remember, but if we were operating with a carrier task force there would have been a lot going on. Everything conspired to make us all want to die. Water was probably being thrown on top of our compartment, the wind was probably howling, and the smell of vomit was strong. Everyone in CIC was sick but me. That included our division officer, who was lying face down on the deck with his head near the entrance to CIC. Anyone entering would bang the door into his head. He lay near a trash can, and every now and then he would raise his head to puke into the can. I had a splitting headache, but I wasn’t incapacitated for the simple reason that I couldn’t afford to be. The safety of the ship depended on me. If someone else had been on that position they would not have had the luxury to be sick either. Mind over matter. More Random Memories… When we were in a foreign port, the crew would be allowed to go ashore after they had completed their duties for the day, but we all had to return by midnight. The age of the average junior enlisted man was probably about 20, and most had never been away from home prior to joining the Navy. Their favorite activity seemed to be to find the closest bar and proceed to get as drunk as possible. Some thought starting a large bar fight only added to the fun. I didn’t drink, but wandering the dock area of a strange foreign port alone in the middle of the night was a bad idea. There were a lot of people that didn’t like American sailors. So, often, I would end up in a bar anyway. I could act as the designated sober guy for some of my shipmates. In addition to the small individual lockers we each had, there was a communal locker where we kept our large pea coats. Each was kept in a plastic bag with a zipper. I bring this up because, after waking one morning, after we had all been ashore the night before, I mentioned that I had had a vivid dream. I dreamt that someone had taken a piss in the pea coat locker. It was such a vivid dream that I felt compelled to look. I guess it wasn’t a dream after all. The bottom of one bag was swollen with what looked like a gallon of urine. The bottom of the pea coat was immersed and it acted as a wick, so the entire bottom of the coat was saturated. No problem. It wasn’t my bag! One more sea story. This one also takes place in our berthing compartment. The aisle between rows of racks was narrow. On the top rack of one row lived a sailor with a temper. Adjacent to him was a sailor who snored loudly. I dreamt that they were having a fight in the middle of the night. In the morning, the sailor who snored was complaining he had been attacked by bed bugs during the night because his face was covered with welts. I glanced across to the grouchy guy’s rack and there was a metal clothes hanger that was bent up like a pretzel. I was the only one who knew what had happened while they both slept. I kept it to myself. Okay … One more sea story. At some point, a first-class electronics tech came aboard. A first class is a pretty high enlisted rank — an E-6. It takes years to attain that rank, but he had served his entire Navy career up to that point working ashore. This was to be his first experience on a ship. He was a genuinely nice guy and wanted to get off on the right foot with the rest of the crew, so he asked if there was anything he could do. Big mistake! A hand-painted Steinaker seal., NHHC One of the first things you learn is to never volunteer, unless you are extremely bored and want to roll the dice. Anyway, it was suggested that he could stand mail-buoy watch on the bow, which would be most appreciated. Of course, never having served aboard a ship, he was unfamiliar with how we received our mail at sea. It was explained that the Navy always knew where we were, and our intended course, so they could pack our mail in a waterproof sack attached to a bright red buoy with a flashing light attached and chuck it out of a plane directly in our path. That was such a masterful load of BS that I almost believed it myself! Standing on the bow, searching for the mail buoy, you are visible to everyone on the bridge. No one stands on the bow underway because it’s cold and windy, and you’re going to get blasted with spray, even on a good day. I think he lasted at least one hour. That might have been a record! Second Cruise Into The Med And Then To The Gulf My aforementioned run-in with a Russian Foxtrot submarine occurred as we were heading for the Mediterranean Sea via the Strait of Gibraltar. Once in the Med, we made several port calls — probably Italy, France, Greece, and Spain. Then we headed through the Suez Canal to the Red Sea and into the Indian Ocean. If you’ve never been in that part of the world in summer, you do not know the meaning of the word “hot.” The ship had a seawater intake near its bottom, where water could be drawn in to feed the evaporators to make fresh water. I think it was probably about ten feet below the surface. I remember being told that the seawater injection temperature was 96 degrees. Fortunately, during a fleet rehabilitation and modernization upgrade, the ship’s berthing compartments, critical machinery spaces, and CIC had been air-conditioned. One of the favorite dispensers in the mess area was a soft-serve machine that produced a frozen vanilla concoction resembling ice cream. The prepackaged mix came in a five-gallon bladder inside a cardboard box. It had to be kept refrigerated. As the saying goes, bread tends to land buttered side down, so of course the refrigerator failed, and those soft-serve bladders began to ferment. As the mix began to putrefy, gas was created, and the plastic bags began to expand and break through the cardboard boxes. It was only a matter of time before those bags exploded, showering the area with unimaginable putrefaction. So, as a junior enlisted man, I was among the lucky sailors tasked with jettisoning the bags overboard. The path from the refrigerator, or “reefer,” involved scaling a vertical ladder to the main deck. There was no way for two sailors to share the load, so we each had to shoulder a bulbous sloshing 50-pound bag and attempt to scale the ladder with one hand on the bag and the other on the ladder. One of two things usually happened: Either the sailor lost control of the bag and it fell to the deck where it exploded, showering the area, or, worse yet, the bag burst near the head of the unfortunate sailor hanging by one hand halfway up the ladder. Even using a thesaurus, I can’t find words to describe the stench. The phrase “gag a maggot” comes to mind. Operating In The Gulf Fifty-three years ago, we were the only U.S. naval vessel in the entire Persian Gulf. Currently, I believe there are oftentimes two complete carrier task forces in the area. In terms of manpower, the Navy has gone from a few hundred sailors in the region to many thousands. A map showing the eastern Mediterranean, Red, and Arabian Seas, with the Persian Gulf just to the right of the center., Google Maps A naval vessel is unique. There is a diplomatic component to any foreign port visit. Often, the captain would welcome foreign dignitaries aboard and host them for tea in the wardroom, while we were busy in the electronic countermeasures room collecting all their military radar signatures. The information collected would be sent to the nearest electronic intelligence (ELINT) center for analysis. The data collected helped determine a potential adversary’s order of battle. This may seem cynical, but history has shown that it is necessary. Charles de Gaulle is credited with the observation that nations have no friends, only interests. After transiting the Suez Canal, we headed south in the Red Sea toward our first scheduled port visit in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. When we arrived at the entrance to the port, we were navigating using a British Admiralty chart that had been last updated in the late 1800s . The bottom was shallow and did not match the chart, so the captain turned us around, and we left, leaving the local poobah standing pier-side with his entourage and wondering what just happened. It turned out that a lot of diplomatic effort had gone into organizing that little get-together, and the State Department was not happy. Next, we stopped to refuel in Yemen, in the Port of Aden, where the USS Cole was attacked in 2000. It was considered a dangerous port even in 1967, and it was the first time we posted armed sentries. Once we had refueled, we turned east toward the Arabian Sea and our next port call. The USS Cole (DDG-67) is towed away from the port city of Aden, Yemen, into the open sea by the Military Sealift Command ocean-going tug USNS Catawba (T-ATF-168) on Oct. 29, 2000., Department of Defense/Sgt. Don L. Maes, USMC Salalah In Oman If you look at a map showing the extent of the British Empire in the early 1900s, it resembles a map of the world. They seemed to be everywhere, including the Persian Gulf. In 1967 the Brits were still active in the region and had small bases all along the southern Arabian Peninsula. Our next stop was Salalah, a small speck on the chart and home to an isolated little Royal Air Force (RAF) Base and an adjacent village that was completely walled off with a huge gate for access. It looked like a set from the movie King Kong. Once we were tied up at the small pier, we were met by a wild-looking bunch of Brits wearing some bits of RAF uniforms, local articles of clothing, and checkered red-and-white headscarves. They definitely had a relaxed uniform standard! They picked us up in a big flatbed truck, and we sped off at high speed toward their base. When we finally arrived, I asked why they drove so fast. The answer was that it was harder to toss a grenade into the truck at that speed, and if they hit a mine, it might only blow the back of the truck off. The bloke that told me that was not smiling. Once at the entrance of the base, we were met by the ceremonial guards supplied by the sheik that ruled the village. Here’s a picture my shipmate Bob White took: Courtesy of the author You thought I was exaggerating, didn’t you? The land there was as flat as a pancake, with mountains way in the distance. We spent the evening with the Brits. They had a piano and liked to get drunk and sing together. I think I was told that, unlike us, once you were assigned somewhere, you usually stayed there until you left the service, and some of those guys had been there for 10 years or more. As I mentioned, the village was run by a sheik, an educated man who loved Elvis Presley. Each night some of the officers and one enlisted man would hop in their Land Rover and go to the village, where the enlisted man acted as a projectionist and showed a movie. Every now and then Marxist rebels would swoop down from the mountains and shoot the place up, and then take off on their camels. The Brits would put a patrol together and chase after them. It sounded harmless until they mentioned that the RAF base to their west had been wiped out in a recent attack. I failed to mention that the villagers had no running water and did not know what electricity was. Each morning the villagers would open that huge gate and drag a big longboat out into the water and proceed to go fishing. This is what Salalah looks like now: The Port of Salalah, Oman., Getty Images To put this in perspective, their deep-water general cargo terminal can handle 20 million tons annually, and the liquid bulk terminal can handle another six million tons. After Salalah, we paid a visit to Cochin, India, and Karachi, Pakistan. In Cochin, I remember a legless beggar sitting by the side of a dirt road with his beggar cup as a Mercedes with tinted windows thundered by. One of my shipmates and I spent the evening on the roof of a local hotel chatting with a Peace Corps volunteer who was giving up and going home. Karachi was the most hostile place I have ever been. I think they had just had an election, and there were red hammer-and-sickle flags hanging everywhere. As we walked the streets in our sailor suits, the locals glared at us from every direction. After leaving those two garden spots, we headed into the Persian Gulf, through the Strait of Hormuz, and north to the island country of Bahrain. Bahrain’s claim to fame seemed to be that the huge oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia ended there where ships could load up. We were able to visit an oil refinery for lunch. I remember that there were hovels outside the main gate with a sorry-looking camel tied up, but inside it looked like a scene from Leave It To Beaver — rows of small houses with white picket fences and a window box with flowers on each one. As we soon found out, Brits, Germans, and American engineers were at the top of the food chain, and so-called OFNs — other foreign nationals — did most of the work. OFNs were usually skilled Indians, Filipinos, or sometimes Bangladeshis. Lunch consisted of the best steak I have ever tasted. I found out that the chef was lured away from some Michelin three-star restaurant in Europe to keep the honchos happy. Food was shipped in from all over the world for their dining pleasure. Later, we took the strangest bus ride I have ever been on. We drove out into the middle of the island and saw nothing but pipes heading in various directions. Eventually, we stopped beside an exceptionally large pipe, with a large valve. Our guide had us all exit the bus and then he pointed to the valve and I think he said something like, “This is the valve!” We then reboarded the bus and returned. I think it might have been the valve that controlled the world’s oil supply. The things that seem to stand out after all these years include the few intense experiences, but mainly the funny ones. Looking back, I think getting a loaf of freshly baked bread from the cook in the middle of the night and eating it with my buddies rises to the top. It was while steaming along late at night, when almost all the crew were sleeping, that I enjoyed my time aboard Steinaker the most. It was then that all the stress and petty annoyances of being at the bottom of a rigid hierarchical organization faded away and I was free to simply do my job to the best of my ability. I helped to keep my shipmates safe while they slept. Maybe that was enough.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 11, 2021",Navy Follows Air Force In Wanting Another Jet Trainer Variant For Aggressor And Support Roles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Major changes to advanced jet training are currently in vogue within the U.S. Department of Defense, and the latest requirement has now been drafted by the Navy, which is seeking a “Tactical Surrogate Aircraft.” It is described as a two-seat “fighter type” jet that the service will be able to use as a companion trainer and as an adversary. The latest Sources Sought Notice has many parallels with the Navy’s plans to introduce a new Undergraduate Jet Training System (UJTS), which you can read more about here , as well as with the Air Force’s recent Advanced Tactical Trainer proposal , both of which could be considered revolutionary, for better or worse. The Sources Sought Notice for the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft was published yesterday and involves the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) Specialized and Proven Aircraft Program Office (PMA-226), which is looking for information from industry. The same notice describes the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft as “a key tool for future fighter pilot training” and states that the Navy is currently examining a potential buy of 64 jets, for which a formal program could potentially be launched in fiscal year 2024 or FY2025. A pair of U.S. Navy T-45 Goshawks. As well as replacing these aircraft as intermediate and advanced trainers, the Navy is now eyeing an advanced trainer that can undertake adversary and companion trainer missions., U.S. NAVY/LT. J.G. JOHN A. IVANCIC The Sources Sought Notice is not a guarantee the Navy will actually pursue a Tactical Surrogate Aircraft procurement. Instead, it’s simply a feasibility study that will aim to find out the costs and timelines involved in such a program. The requirements of the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft are threefold. The first role is as a companion trainer, an aircraft that provides additional flight time and continuation training for naval aviators who have already graduated with their “wings of gold” and have progressed to a frontline Type Model Series (TMS) aircraft. This kind of capability is of increasing relevance for air forces in general, with a need to reduce expensive flight hours on operational types and also preserve precious airframe life on high-end and, increasingly, fifth-generation types, such as the Navy’s F-35C stealth fighter and whatever might come after it . In the past, the Navy has also referred to this requirement as “tactical auxiliary.” A U.S. Navy F-35C Lightning II., U.S. Air Force/R. Nial Bradshaw Not surprisingly, the Navy wants the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft to “simulate and/or replicate current and future fighter aircraft systems,” which would be a prerequisite of the companion trainer role, in particular. The aircraft, like the UJTS trainer, is not required to perform catapult launches or arrested landings aboard aircraft carriers, opening the door to various land-based types. The second requirement is for adversary air support, essentially the same kind of red air threat replication that’s currently provided to the Navy by a mix of in-house aggressor squadrons flying an assortment of jets, as well as by contractors, who provide services to different branches of the military, often in support of specific training events. On the Navy side, efforts are already underway to meet the growing demand for red air, the service adding surplus USAF F-16s for adversary duties in a process you can read more about here . An F-5N from Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401 taxis on the flight line at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, Calif. The Tactical Surrogate Aircraft could ultimately supplant these lower-end aggressor jets., U.S. MARINE CORPS/SGT. KIMBERLYN ADAMS The kinds of red air work that a trainer-based platform might be expected to perform would not necessarily include dueling with fighters in large-scale exercises, for example, but such an aircraft would be entirely suitable for more basic target duties, including radar intercepts and threat replication for warships . Last, the Navy envisages its Tactical Surrogate Aircraft serving as “a flight lead aircraft for Fleet Replacement Squadrons.” These squadrons are the operational training units for the Navy’s frontline force and in the tactical community. Their job includes carrier qualifying new pilots for specific aircraft types, as well as other critical tactical aspects of the assigned mission. The flight lead aircraft is the one flown by the flight leader in a multi-aircraft formation, which suggests that this role envisages a jet that will be used as part of the training process for future fighter pilots within the relevant Fleet Replacement Squadrons. An E/A-18G Growler assigned to Electronic Attack Squadron (VAQ) 129, the type Fleet Replacement Squadron, makes an arrested landing during carrier qualifications off the coast of Southern California., U.S. Navy/Midshipman 3rd Class Noah P. Rodman Perhaps, when serving as a flight lead aircraft, the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft could be equipped with additional training aids to increase the effectiveness of the syllabus being delivered. Other possibilities include using the jet to practice more complex parts of the conversion syllabus before going out and doing the same in a frontline jet, or possibly accompanying pilots as they undergo their first carrier qualifications on the ship itself. Interestingly, the first two of the stated requirements are already stipulated as part of UJTS, so it’s not entirely clear why the Navy has now decided to look at a discrete Tactical Surrogate Aircraft that would be acquired on top of the selected UJTS trainer, or T-XX, which will directly replace the T-45 Goshawk for the intermediate and advanced portions of the training program for future Navy and Marine fighter pilots. Today, the T-45 jet trainer is used to train Navy and Marine Corps pilots: https://youtube.com/watch?v=2vDtT87v1Ao The Sources Sought Notice also brings attention to the various capabilities and attributes that the Navy needs in a potential Tactical Surrogate Aircraft. These include a two-seat cockpit that can be configured for single-seat while the rear cockpit can be configured for a variety of missions. Performance-wise, a minimum level aircraft speed of at least Mach 0.9 is stipulated at 10,000 feet, with a minimum ceiling of 45,000 feet, and minimum G-force structural limits of at least 7.5G or 6G sustained. The Navy demands an average sortie duration of at least 90 minutes, including 30 minutes of tactical maneuvering, and provides further details for three particular mission profile subsets: Basic Fighter Maneuvering (BFM), air-to-air, and air-to-ground. In the cockpit, the Navy wants to provide the pilots with large-area displays and open architecture avionics that can accept additional inputs to replicate frontline aircraft cockpits as well as present simulated displays of aircraft combat systems, simulated inputs, and simulated weapons. In addition to the displays, the hands-on stick and throttle (HOTAS) controls should also be reconfigurable to replicate “multiple” frontline aircraft. The pilot should also be provided with a low-cost helmet-mounted display , again capable of being configured to mimic the displays found on frontline jets. In the cockpit of a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet from the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) and Carrier Air Wing 5 during operations in the South China Sea., U.S. Navy Specific items of avionics outlined in the list of requirements include Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) Increment II, Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), and Red Net, the latter being a tactical and situational awareness datalink system that uses a commercially available tablet-kneeboard display. Red Net has already been installed on Marine Corps F-5N/F aggressor jets, and you can read all about it here . The Tactical Combat Training System Increment II (TCTS II) pod during initial hardware qualification testing at Patuxent River, Maryland, last year., U.S. Navy Various mission kits are envisaged for the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft, with the standard load-out comprising a Captive Air Training Missile (CATM) on one wingtip and one of several different types of Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods on the other wingtip. Underwing stations should be able to carry fuel tanks, or additional pods, including electronic warfare pods. As is common for a modern advanced trainer, the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft will need to be able to record flight data and performance information onto a data storage device and/or downloaded in flight, for post-flight analysis. On top of these must-have features, the Navy also proposes various desired capabilities that could be selected for the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft if feasible. Among them are additional sensors (ECM, infrared search and track, radar, threat emulator), automatic ground collision avoidance system and autopilot, and an analysis of a potential air-to-air refueling capability via probe and drogue or a boom receptacle. Thought is also given to making the aircraft more modular, to adapt to different engines and equipment. In this way, the Navy is interested in the potential of filling the rear cockpit space with extra fuel or avionics, as well as a universal engine bay to accommodate alternative engines. It’s noted that a lot of these elements, while desirable, might be rejected on cost grounds. Finally, there is the option of bringing in virtual reality training aids, including a ground-based “smart chair,” capable of uploading previous flight performance information for review or rehearsal. The Navy has set a Nov. 19, 2021, deadline to receive information from potential vendors, and it’s fairly clear that the same candidates that have responded to UJTS will be in a good position. In particular, Boeing has already presented its T-7B concept that would seem a good fit for the requirement. As proposed in early 2020, this development of the Air Force’s T-7A Red Hawk would add wingtip stations for captive missiles and ACMI pods, an internal infrared search system, a cockpit reconfigurable to replicate the F/A-18E/F Block III or the F-35 , and an optional jamming pod. An artist’s concept of a U.S. Navy T-7 variant over Naval Air Station Pensacola, Fla., KEVIN KING/WIKICOMMONS BACKGROUND The T-7B’s rivals for UJTS would also likely be offered for any potential Tactical Surrogate Aircraft competition. These are Lockheed Martin/Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) T-50A and the Leonardo M-346 Master . Unlike the T-7 and T-50, the M-346 is subsonic, but the current requirements for the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft accommodate that. It’s possible, too, that other manufacturers will come forward with offerings for UJTS and/or the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft. While there is no guarantee the Navy will ultimately pursue the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft, it’s clear it sees a demand for more companion trainers and adversaries and that the UJTS program won’t necessarily provide enough airframes to meet this. Speaking to The War Zone about UJTS last year, Rear Adm. Gregory “Hyfi” Harris, the Director of the Air Warfare Division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, said: “I believe that in Naval Aviation we’re probably looking at a platform that is multi-role. We’ve reached out to industry to see what is in the realm of possible, as much as finding a platform that we can do carrier aviation training with, but also may have the flexibility in that platform to be able to grow. Whether that’s similar to what the Air Force is looking at potentially with their T-7 or not, I don’t know.” With parallels between the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft the Air Force’s recent Advanced Tactical Trainer proposal, it’s possible a common airframe will eventually be selected for both, which would put the T-7, or a derivative of it, in pole position to receive many more orders. If and when we will see a formal program for the Tactical Surrogate Aircraft is unclear, but it’s a statement of intent that the Navy wants its next-generation jet trainer to take on vital roles above and beyond those flown by today’s T-45.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2021",U.S. Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon Test Fails (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but the Pentagon has confirmed that a U.S. military test today of a long-range hypersonic weapon from Alaska has failed. There are reports that the system being tested was the missile design that will be used in the U.S. Army’s Dark Eagle and the U.S. Navy’s Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike weapon systems. But it is uncertain that is the case considering where this test took place, and an entirely separate booster stack or even different hypersonic payload may have been used. This all follows an earlier official statement about three successful tests yesterday related to the development of that common Army-Navy weapon. Reuters was first to report on this failed test, which was conducted from the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska on Kodiak Island in that state. Other outlets are now reporting many of the same basic details, but exactly what was being tested and how it failed remain unclear. “A booster rocket with a hypersonic glide body attached failed to launch today during a launch test at Kodiak, Alaska says a U.S. official,” ABC News’ Luis Martinez wrote on Twitter. This raises questions about whether the missile even left the pad during this test. The Army and Navy have been working together on a hypersonic weapon since 2017, with the services planning to fire it from ground-based launchers and ships and submarines , respectively. Aviation Week ‘s Steve Trimble has reported that this failed test was the first attempt to test a prototype of this common missile, which consists of a two-stage booster with a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on top. Both services have previously conducted tests of the vehicle itself using other boosters . The Army and Navy had previously said they intended to begin flight testing their common hypersonic weapon in the 2022 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. The Army had also said earlier this year that at least some of this testing would be carried out from Kodiak. The Pentagon had earlier confirmed to Reuters that it conducted three successful tests of “advanced hypersonic technologies, capabilities, and prototype systems” related to Dark Eagle and the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) weapon system “in a realistic operating environment.” Sandia National Laboratories , which designed the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that the Army and Navy are using on their common missile, led those tests, which took place at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Indications of an impending test from Kodiak, which has also been used for missile-defense-related testing in the past, had arisen earlier this week in the form of alerts to civilian pilots and mariners about potential hazards. Those notices indicated that Kodiak was the launch point and that the impact area would be near or within the boundary of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, a U.S. Army-managed test range at Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The distance between these launch and impact points is significantly longer than the stated range of the common Army-Navy hypersonic missile. The Army has only said in the past that Dark Eagle will be able to hit targets out to a distance of “greater than” 1,725 miles away. The distance between Kodiak and Kwajalein is around 4,000 miles. This failed test also notably comes after reports that China has tested a new fractional orbital bombard weapon system that uses a hypersonic glide vehicle. News of those tests first broke on Sunday , with a second report coming out yesterday that said the Chinese had conducted two tests of this weapon system earlier this year, not one as had been initially reported. You can read more about what we know of this Chinese development here . U.S. President Joe Biden also said yesterday that he was concerned by China’s new hypersonic weapon developments. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Updated 6:20 PM EST: U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Tim Gorman, a Pentagon spokesperson, has provided the following statement regarding today’s failed test: On Oct. 21, the Department of Defense conducted a data collection experiment from the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska, Kodiak, AK, to inform the department’s hypersonic technology development. The test did not occur as planned due to a failure of the booster stack. The booster stack used in the test was not part of the hypersonic program and is not related to the Common Hypersonic Glide Body. The missile booster is used for testing purposes only. Program officials have initiated a review to determine the cause of the booster system failure to inform future tests. Experiments and tests – both successful and unsuccessful – are the backbone of developing highly complex, critical technologies at tremendous speed, as the department is doing with hypersonic technologies. Delivering hypersonic weapons remains a top priority, and the department remains confident that it is on track to field offensive hypersonic capabilities beginning in the early 2020s. This flight test is part of an ongoing series of flight tests as we continue to develop this technology. From this statement, it remains unclear whether whatever this missile was actually left the launch pad. We still don’t know exactly what the reason for the booster stack’s failure was, either. In addition, this statement raises questions about exactly what was under test today, especially if it is entirely unrelated to the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB). This C-HGB is the boost-glide vehicle that will be used on Army and Navy’s common hypersonic missile. It is possible that this could have been a test of something entirely new, which may not even necessarily be a weapon system. That it might not be directly related to Dark Eagle or IRCPS would also fit with the apparent expected range of the test that we had already noted. Updated 7:00 PM EST: It has been brought to our attention that the failed test may have been one known as Hypersonic Flight Test-3, or FT-3. A report from earlier this year regarding a consultation between the National Marine Fisheries Service, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Army over possible violations of the Endangered Species Act that could result from FT-3, something that is generally an issue when it comes to testing at Kwajalein, says the following: The proposed action involves launching a single developmental test missile (Hypersonic Flight Test-3, FT-3) from the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska (PSCA) on Kodiak Island, Alaska, which would travel across a broad ocean area (BOA) of the Pacific Ocean. The payload impact would be at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS) at Illeginni Islet in Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) (Figure 1). The purpose of FT-3 is to demonstrate a reduction of risk for a longer-range payload system and the data collected from this flight would be used to improve performance prediction models of the system. The FT-3 is a flight test that will be similar to and a crucial step in the developmental process following the Flight Experiment-1 (FE-1) and Flight Experiment-2 (FE-2), which were flight tests conducted in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The “Figure 1” referenced above is the map seen below, which aligns well with the navigational warnings that appear to have been issued in regard to today’s failed test. That map also makes clear that this test would involve a three-stage booster stack, rather than a two-stage one that will be used on the common Army-Navy hypersonic missile. A map showing the projected trajectory of the planned FT-3 test., National Marine Fisheries Service Flight Experiment-1 (FE-1) and Flight Experiment-2 (FE-2) are also mentioned in this passage from the report. FE-1 refers to a test of a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle using a booster fired from an unspecified Ohio class submarine in 2017. FE-2 was another hypersonic boost-glide vehicle test conducted in 2020 using a three-stage ground-launched STARS booster . Both of these tests have helped inform the development of what has since evolved into the Dark Eagle and IRCPS weapon systems. Updated 7:30 PM EST: The Navy has now released additional information on the earlier hypersonic tests at Wallops Island in Virginia. A trio of what were described as precision sounding rockets were used to carry out those “hypersonic experiments” in cooperation with the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike program office, the Army’s Hypersonic Program Office, the Pentagon’s Joint Hypersonic Transition Office , Sandia National Laboratories, Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory , the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , the MITRE Corporation , and “several defense contractors,” according to an official release . “During weapon system development, precision sounding rocket launches fill a critical gap between ground testing and full system flight testing,” the official release added. “These launches allow for frequent and regular flight testing opportunities to support rapid maturation of offensive and defensive hypersonic technologies.” “This test is a vital step in the development of a Navy-designed common hypersonic missile, consisting of a Common Hypersonic Glide Body (CHGB) and booster, which will be fielded by both the Navy and Army with individual weapon systems and launchers tailored for launch from sea or land,” it continued. “The Department of Defense (DoD) successfully tested the CHGB on March 20, 2020. The Navy and Army will continue to work in close collaboration to leverage joint testing opportunities.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Armies Land Land-Based Conventional Hypersonic Weapons Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) Navies Sea U.S. Army U.S. Navy"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 30, 2021",Armada Of 10 Chinese And Russian Warships Is Sailing Around Japan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A group of 10 Chinese and Russian naval vessels is conducting a joint patrol along a route that increasingly suggests it might take them all the way around Japan’s Home Islands. Even if none of these ships ultimately sail a full loop around the Japanese archipelago, this operation is still a significant display of the ability of these two navies to work together. This all follows a number of major maritime exercises in the Pacific involving the U.S. Navy and its allies and partners — including Japan — this year, as well as multiple instances in which Chinese and Russian naval forces have separately operated unusually close to American territory . The Japanese Ministry of Defense announced today that it had monitored the Chinese and Russian ships passing west between Smith Island and the island of Torishima, an area situated some 300 miles south of the Home Island of Honshu. The vessels first entered the Pacific Ocean, traveling east through the Tsugaru Strait that separates Honshu and the Home Island of Hokkaido to the north, on Oct. 18, 2021. A map the Japanese Ministry of Defense released showing the movement of a group of Chinese and Russian naval vessels since it passed through the Tsugaru Strait on Oct. 18, 2021., Japanese MoD A picture the Japanese Ministry of Defense released showing Chinese and Russian naval vessels sailing near the country’s Home Islands sometime in the past week., Japanese MoD Japanese authorities have said, so far, that all of these ships have remained in international waters throughout the course of this joint operation. This includes their passage through the Tsugaru Strait, which is only around 12 miles wide at its narrowest point. Though a country’s territorial waters can extend out to 12 miles from its coastlines, Japan only claims areas three miles from either shore in this strait, creating an international channel through the middle. This was reportedly done to allow U.S. warships and submarines carrying nuclear weapons to pass through the area without violating Japanese law that bans any introduction of such weapons into the country’s territory. The flotilla consists of five ships each from the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and the Russian Navy. The Chinese contingent includes a Type 055 destroyer , a Type 052D destroyer , two Type 054A frigates , and an at-sea replenishment ship. Two Udaloy class destroyers, two Steregushchiy class corvettes , and what was identified as a Marshal Nedelin class missile range instrumentation ship, make up the Russian contributions. The PLAN Type 055 destroyer., Japanese MoD The PLAN Type 052D destroyer., Japanese MoD The PLAN Type 054A frigates., Japanese MoD The PLAN replenishment ship., Japanese MoD The Russian Navy Udaloy class destroyers., Japanese MoD The Russian Navy Steregushchiy class corvettes., Japanese MoD The Russian Navy Marshal Nedelin class missile range instrumentation ship., Japanese MoD The Marshal Nedelin class ship appears to be the Marshal Krylov , which was originally designed to support the Soviet space program and also had the ability to track and gather data about missile tests but has reportedly now been converted into a command ship . The Marshal Krylov was among the ships from Russia’s Pacific Fleet that conducted a separate series of drills that brought them unusually close to the U.S. Hawaiian Islands earlier this year. “It is the first time for Chinese and Russian naval ships to sail the Tsugaru Strait together, as you [the media] have pointed out,” Japan’s Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki told reporters earlier this week after the Chinese and Russian ships passed through that body of water. “The Japanese government has a strong interest in the activities of Chinese and Russian naval ships around Japan, so we are closely monitoring.” The Japanese Ministry of Defense has said that the destroyer JS Takanami , the lead ship in its class, the Asagiri c lass destroyer Yamagiri , and the Sugashima class minesweeper Izushima have been shadowing the Chinese and Russian vessels at various points in their journey. Japanese P-3C Orion maritime patrol planes have also been tracking them. Authorities in Japan also said today that unspecified fighter jets were scrambled after one Russian Ka-27 helicopter and one Chinese Ka-28 helicopter were detected taking off from ships in the group. Pictures the Japanese Ministry of Defense released of the Russian Ka-27 helicopter, top, and the Chinese Ka-28 helicopter at bottom., Japanese MoD This joint Chinese-Russian naval patrol had immediately followed the conclusion of an exercise involving these ships in the East Sea, which wrapped up on Sunday, the 17th. Those drills had already been an important demonstration of cooperation between these two navies and marked the first time one of the PLAN’s Type 055 destroyers had trained together with foreign warships. The Type 055, which the U.S. military describes as a cruiser rather than a destroyer, is the PLAN’s most modern and capable warship. Each one of these ships has over 100 vertical launch system cells that can hold surface-to-air missiles, as well as anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles, among other advanced capabilities, as you can read more about here . Following those drills and the transit through the Tsugaru Strait, Global Times , a newspaper directly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, ran a story on Oct. 19 that specifically raised the possibility that “the joint task force encircle Japan or approach the US.” It’s worth noting that a different PLAN surface action group that included another Type 055 — as well as a Type 052D, a replenishment ship, and intelligence gathering vessel — had conducted an uncommon cruise near Alaska in September. The Russian Navy, as was already noted, conducted its own drills very close to Hawaii earlier this year and has been increasingly active near Alaska in recent years, as well. Chinese naval vessels seen from the deck of a U.S. Coast Guard cutter shadowing them near Alaska in 2021., USCG The Chinese and Russian naval vessels currently appear to be headed for the East China Sea, and it looks more and more like they could then turn north and take a trip around Japan’s Home Islands. Circling the Japanese archipelago, which also plays host to significant American forces — including the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet — would send a very distinct signal about the ability of China and Russia to work together militarily in support of their own respective national interests. It’s worth pointing out that China and Russia both have significant ongoing territorial disputes with Japan , among a variety of other geopolitical issues in the region. It also remains very possible that the flotilla, or elements of it, might head in a different direction after entering the East China Sea. Another option might be to turn south and head toward Taiwan, where tensions have been growing between the governments in Beijing and Taipei. On multiple occasions in recent months, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has sent dozens of military aircraft on sorties into the southwest corner of the island’s Air Defense Identification Zone. Though these flights have all been in international airspace, the clear goal is to intimidate Taiwanese authorities. There have been a number of Chinese naval exercises near the island that have sent the same general signals , as well. Back in 2016, Russia and China joined together for exercises in the South China Sea that centered on island-seizing scenarios. There has also been a recent spike in broader geopolitical friction between China and other countries, especially the United States , over the matter of Taiwan, as well as a host of other issues. The U.S. military, which has described China as its “pacing threat” and prime competitor, has conducted its own slew of naval and air exercises in the Pacific Region this year, including a number of recent drills that have involved various allies and partners. Just last week, American, British, Australian, and Japanese naval vessels and military aircraft joined together for a large-scale training event known as the Maritime Partnership Exercise (MPX). The ships that took part included the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson , the Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s Izumo class JS Kaga . Carl Vinson and Kaga had also taken part in this year’s iteration of the Malabar exercise, together with ships and aircraft from the Indian and Australian militaries. Kaga’s participation in these, as well as other exercises, is significant because Japan has long officially described its two Izumo class ships as “helicopter destroyers,” but authorities in the country officially announced the planned conversion of both ships to what will be aircraft carriers in all but name back in 2018 . Earlier this month, U.S. Marine F-35B Joint Strike Fighters flew from the deck of the Izumo , which has already gone through the first phase of the conversion process, underscoring the ship’s new capabilities. Deterring China and otherwise showing solidary with allies and partners in the Pacific have, in general, been the stated reasons for many of these recent U.S.-led exercises in the region. This reflects a broader push in support of these strategic policy objectives on the part of the U.S. government. A new defense cooperation agreement between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, which includes a controversial plan to establish a new Royal Australian Navy nuclear-powered submarine force , is a prime example of these efforts. The deal paves the way for even greater defense and security cooperation between these three countries going forward. This has all not gone unnoticed by authorities in Beijing and it’s not surprising that they would be interested in conducting a joint naval patrol with the Russians in response. As noted earlier, the two countries have conducted long-range bomber operations together in recent years, including sorites near Japan and South Korea , underscoring growing cooperation between the militaries, in general. U.S.-Russian relations at present are also very cold, which only provides increased incentives for cooperation between Beijing and the Kremlin. All told, wherever this task force of Chinese and Russian ships may be headed now, it seems likely that we will see more joint naval operations between the countries in the future, especially if the U.S. military and its allies and partners continue to conduct similar activities in the Pacific.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Aug 19, 2019",The Military’s Mobile Nuclear Reactor Prototype Is Set To Begin Taking Shape,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Office of The Secretary of Defense (OSD) has requested $60 million dollars for Project Pele, which is aimed at developing a new, transportable nuclear microreactor to provide high-output, resilient power for a wide variety of Department of Defense (DOD) missions. The DOD hopes to begin working on a prototype reactor design, which will hopefully be able to eventually produce one to five megawatts of electricity and operate at peak power for at least three years, in the next fiscal year. The request for funding for Project Pele is found in the Pentagon’s proposed budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which was released on May 28, 2021. This is the first year that the Office of the Secretary of Defense has asked for money for this program through the larger Advanced Innovative Technologies line item. Previous funding for Pele, also known as the Micro Nuclear Reactor Program, had come through a separate Operational Energy Capability Improvement account in OSD’s budget. Concept art of Westinghouse Electric’s DeVinci mobile reactor design, which was submitted to the Department of Defense in for Project Pele., Westinghouse Electric The budget documents say that the goals for Project Pele in the 2022 Fiscal Year are to “complete the design phase and prepare for construction of a 1-5 Megawatt electric transportable nuclear microreactor.” In addition, it notes that “due to the nature of this project, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.” “The Pele project continues activities initiated under Congressional direction in FY 2020 and FY 2021,” according to the documents. “Congressional Adds [totaling $16 million in the 2021 Fiscal Year] directed for nuclear fuel core development to support the Pele reactor maturation and also funding to support power and thermal management maturation for directed energy weapons.” DOD A large part of the Project Pele is the development of Tri-structural Isotropic (TRISO) fuel , what the DOE calls “the most robust Nuclear Fuel on earth.” TRISO consists of tiny poppy-seed sized kernels of uranium, carbon and oxygen encapsulated by layers of carbon- and ceramic-based materials designed to block the emission of radioactive fission products. X-Energy, one of the companies awarded a contract to create a reactor design for Pele, develops its own proprietary form of TRISO known as TRISO-X . X-Energy claims their fuel is among the safest available, since it is encapsulated within its own containment vessel and thus greatly reduces the risks associated with nuclear fuels. DOD Project Pele began in 2019 with a request from the DOD’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) that sought prototype designs from three industry partners: Westinghouse Government Services , X-energy, LLC , and BWX Technologies , Inc. “The Pele Program’s uniqueness lies in the reactor’s mobility and safety,” said Project Pele program manager Dr. Jeff Waksman in an official statement in 2020. “We will leverage our industry partners to develop a system that can be safely and rapidly moved by road, rail, sea or air and for quick set up and shut down, with a design which is inherently safe.” In March of this year, X-Energy and BWX were awarded contracts to begin final design work on Pele prototypes. A two-year design-maturation period will now ensue, after which one of the two may be selected to build and actually demonstrate their design. Along with those industry partners, Project Pele is being developed with insights from the Department of Energy (DOE) , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. According to the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the goal of Project Pele is to develop a mobile reactor that minimizes risks, such as nuclear proliferation, environmental contamination, or human harm to operators or civilian populations. As already noted, the Fiscal Year 2022 budget requests says the desired design is as a 1-5 megawatt (MW) nuclear microreactor. For comparison, the output of the smallest nuclear power plant in the United States, New York’s R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, is 581 MW. The desired power output is even smaller than most research reactors. By contrast, the largest nuclear power plant, Palo Verde in Arizona , puts out close to 4,000 MW. The S9G reactor on a Virgina class nuclear submarine can produce 40 MW. According to DOD requirements, the prototype should be able to be up and running within three days of delivery and be able to be safely powered down and removed in only a week. Idaho National Laboratory The funding for Pele also builds on several other developments, which show that the DOD, DOE, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are investing heavily in new nuclear technologies to power a new American space age. “Production of a full-scale fourth-generation nuclear reactor will have significant geopolitical implications for the United States,” said Jay Dryer, director of the Strategic Capabilities Office. “The DOD has led American innovation many times in the past, and with Project Pele, has the opportunity to help us advance on both energy resiliency and carbon emission reductions.” An image from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) portraying potential concept for transporting or deploying nuclear microreactors., GAO In 2020, the White House’s National Space Council published the document “A New Era for Deep Space Exploration and Development” which sought to outline a strategy by which the United States could further establish “a sustainable human and robotic presence across the solar system” through creating “an expanding sphere of commercial, non-governmental activities in which increasing numbers of Americans live and work in space.” Starting with the premise that “the American way of life is reliant on space activities,” the document includes plans such as commercializing low-Earth orbit, expanding both robotic and human exploration, bolstering space-based national security capabilities, and improving “international cooperation for science, safety, security, and economic growth.” Pele is cited in the document as part of the White House’s goals of returning to the Moon, putting humans on Mars, and developing technologies to enable “lower cost commercial activities in space.” Trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov Building on that document’s goals, a January 2021 Executive Order expanded on the National Space Council document by ordering NASA to deliver a report that defines requirements and foreseeable issues for developing a nuclear energy system to enable human and robotic space missions for the next two decades. The order also included plans for a “Common Technology Roadmap” made among NASA and the Departments of Energy, Defense, Commerce, and State for developing and deploying these new reactor technologies. Energy security and dominance have become cornerstones of DOD strategy, given the unbelievable amounts of fuel and energy consumed by the power-hungry systems the modern military depends on. U.S. Army leadership has previously stated that it wants its brigades to be self-sufficient for a week without the need for resupply, and there have been previous calls for microreactors that could fit inside existing platforms such as the C-17 Globemaster. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and other laboratories continue work on the lofty goal of developing miniaturized fusion reactors . The United States isn’t the only nation pursuing new forms of nuclear technologies. For example, Russia has built the first of what could be a number of floating nuclear plants to be deployed across its Far North regions, and is even exploring mounting reactors on the Arctic seafloor, while China has similar plans for floating reactors intended for use in the geopolitically tense South China Sea. A briefing slide from the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory that provides a brief overview of other nuclear reactor developments elsewhere around the world, including smaller and mobile designs., INL There are concerns, of course, associated with deploying mobile nuclear reactors to bases or the battlefield. Meltdowns, waste products, and other malfunctions are always a concern with nuclear energy technologies, and if a reactor in a contested area is destroyed by adversary forces, for example, the risk of environmental contamination is high. That, in turn, could create a political disaster for the DOD and United States. Deploying any nuclear systems abroad also incurs the risk of proliferation if those technologies should fall into the wrong hands due to a forward-operating base or convoy being overrun by hostile forces. A slide from a 2019 Westinghouse Electric briefing that described various “needs” to make microreactors feasible, including addressing various safety and security concerns., Westinghouse Electric Those concerns will no doubt be a major policy consideration when, or if, these mobile reactors ever reach a state of technological readiness to where they can be deployed. New nuclear technologies aren’t the only new energy production and storage systems the DOD is eyeing, however. Revolutionary concepts such as space-based solar power beaming , new forms of hydrogen fuel cells , or even more advanced applications of existing technologies like modular solar generators are all being developed which could revolutionize how the DOD powers its expeditionary forces without the risks associated with nuclear power. New nuclear technologies have been a key focus of DOD efforts lately, and the Pele project, if successful, could open the door to both a new space age and a new energy paradigm for DOD operations worldwide. The Pele project has the potential to create new possibilities for the self-sufficiency of forward-deployed units and reduce the DOD’s unimaginably large fossil fuel usage. In addition to freeing up logistical concerns and operational budgets, the development of a safe, efficient nuclear microreactor could help when it comes to freeing the US, and possibly the world, from its dependence on non-sustainable fuel sources both on and off the battlefield. Still, Project Pele has a lot to prove, and many concerns to overcome, until any of that becomes a reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 6, 2021",Unwanted Global Hawk Drones Are Being Transformed To Support Hypersonic Missile Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman is going to repurpose four ex-U.S. Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk drones as Range Hawk surveillance platforms to monitor hypersonic missile tests. The change of role for the drones is part of the Air Force’s efforts to divest itself of the oldest Global Hawks and reflects the rapidly growing importance of the many hypersonic weapons now in development in the United States, across the services . The official transfer of the four Block 20 Global Hawks under the Pentagon’s Sky Range program took place last week. The drones were transferred from Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, which is home to the 319th Reconnaissance Wing that flies the RQ-4 from there as well as with squadrons and detachments at different operating locations around the globe. The drones were handed over to Northrop Grumman’s Grand Sky location, a separate facility close to Grand Forks that’s dedicated to unmanned aircraft development and testing. An image was released by the U.S. Air Force last year showing a NASA RQ-4 Global Hawk, U.S. civil registration code N874NA, after receiving modifications to support the Sky Range program. , U.S. Air Force Now that they are back with the manufacturer, the Global Hawks will have new equipment installed for their missile-testing mission and will then be flown to facilities either on the east coast or the west coast, to take part in hypersonic missiles trials. Previous reports indicated that the Range Hawks would be used over the Pacific test ranges, which have already hosted various hypersonic missile tests , including of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon , or ARRW, which appears set to be the Air Force’s first operational air-launched hypersonic missile. A B-52H carries a prototype of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, for its first captive carry flight, in June 2019. , U.S. Air Force/Christopher Okula Earlier accounts suggested that some of the Global Hawks redirected to the Sky Range program would be drawn from NASA’s test fleet, although the latest reports indicate that the first four, at least, are from Air Force stocks. However, NASA Global Hawks have supported hypersonic testing in the past, and the agency has already been working with Northrop Grumman on Sky Range. At least one NASA RQ-4 had been adapted for Sky Range trials as of last year, based on an image released by the Air Force . It could also be the case that this drone, with the U.S. civil registration code N874NA, is being used only for experimental work that will inform the production versions of the Range Hawk. Otherwise, it’s unclear exactly what kinds of sensors will be installed on the drones, which were previously used mainly for surveillance of ground targets and electronic intelligence gathering. Contracting documents from 2019 explain that Sky Range, in general, is an extension of the test ranges’ telemetry and Flight Termination Systems adapted for integration into airborne platforms. The result is an asset that can be “emplaced quickly to increase operations tempo and enable coverage across extended, multi-range flight test environments.” The USAF looks to retain just the most capable Block 40 variant of the Global Hawk, like the one shown here. , USAF According to officials speaking at the handover event, new telemetry-gathering sensors will allow the drones to “look up” instead of down, suggesting a radar optimized for aerial targets will be included, as well as electro-optical sensors, perhaps including light detection and ranging ( lidar ) and/or a multispectral telescope . These sensors will need to have considerable range, since hypersonic weapons typically travel considerable distances than many conventional missiles. The drones will also likely be equipped with long-range datalinks to transmit telemetry from missile tests to ground stations in near-real-time. In fact, stringing multiple RQ-4s over great distances could allow them to maintain line-of-sight datalinks, even if as a backup for satellite datalinks during the very-high-stakes tests. They could support other types of critical communications in remote areas, as well as range clearing and other duties. It’s possible the adapted Global Hawks will feature, at least to a limited degree, some capabilities similar to those found on the Navy’s current NP-3D, as well as its future NC-37B range support platforms. The NP-3s have been used in the past to track hypersonic missiles, and you can read about the extensive equipment ‘fits’ found on both types here . A briefing slide from one of the HTV-2 hypersonic tests, showing its path, as well as some of the land and sea assets used to monitor its flight., U.S. Air Force The RQ-4 certainly seems to lend itself to the missile monitoring role. With the ability to carry a 3,000-pound payload capability over a range of 12,300 nautical miles, the drone can perch at an altitude of 60,000 feet to observe high-flying missiles and can remain airborne for more than 34 hours if required. “We’re going to need [remotely piloted aircraft] all the way down the range to do what a whole armada of surface vessels do today,” Major General Christopher Azzano told Air Force Magazine in 2019. “It’s going to be immensely cheaper,” he added, comparing the expected cost of drones with the missile-tracking vessels typically used today. Ultimately, it seems the Range Hawks also could complement NASA’s manned WB-57F aircraft , which are configured to help gather data from missile tests, and which you can read more about here . The drones will, however, require a significant amount of work to bring them back into service, according to a report from the Grand Forks Herald , which covered last week’s handover ceremony: “Two of the large drones — they have a wingspan of 130 feet — were inside Northrop’s 35,000 square foot hangar on Wednesday, with portions of their engines exposed. The drones are scarred and battered and covered with aeronautical tape. From every side, they appear as instruments of war. They have flown missions equivalent to three and a half years of flight time.” It’s also not yet confirmed how long it will take before the Range Hawks are back in the air, let alone flying missions on behalf of the Pentagon’s various hypersonic missiles programs. George Rumford, director of the Pentagon’s Test Resources Management Center that is overseeing the project, told the Grand Forks Herald that work on the drones “will take quite some time.” But once work on the first four Block 20 drones is complete, there are plans for more Range Hawks to be added to the fleet, this time using the later Block 30 models, according to North Dakota’s Sen. John Hoeven. The Air Force is trying to dispose of the Block 30 drones in the next year or two, reducing its Global Hawk fleet to just the more modern Block 40 RQ-4s, at least for the immediate future. An EQ-4 drone outside a hangar at Grand Forks Air Force Base, after concluding its final flight, on July 29, 2021. The EQ-4 was adapted from the Block 20 Global Hawk and was equipped with the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN). , U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Jack LeGrand Although the costly Global Hawks arrived in service with much-vaunted high-level surveillance capabilities, the Air Force has since called for them to be replaced by a variety of different platforms, among them “penetrating” vehicles and “fifth and sixth-generation capabilities .” You can read more about the Air Force’s plans for replacing the Block 20/30 Global Hawks with new types of stealthy platforms in this previous War Zone article . In its Fiscal Year 2021 budget request, the Air Force had asked for approval to retire all 21 of its remaining Block 20 and Block 30 Global Hawks. That would free up additional airframes for the Range Hawk effort and perhaps also for transfer to potential export customers, some of which have shown interest in secondhand Global Hawk variants in the past. As well as the Range Hawks, however, the Sky Range program also envisages smaller MQ-9 Reaper drones adapted as Range Reapers to gather additional data on missile launches. Sky Range is just one of the various efforts that are being made across the U.S. military, and elsewhere within the U.S. government, to support future hypersonic testing. So, while the Air Force might be generally unconvinced about the future of its earlier Global Hawks in their original surveillance role, the prospects for the reworked drone look much more promising in a new role monitoring the Pentagon’s various hypersonic missile tests.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",This Alaskan Air Base Will Host An Experimental Mini Nuclear Reactor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force recently announced that it has picked Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska as the base to host a new small nuclear reactor as part of a pilot program. The U.S. military, as a whole, together with the Department of Energy has been increasingly looking into micro-reactor designs as possible ways to meet ever-growing electricity demands , including for units on the battlefield , as well as to help cut costs and improve general operational efficiency by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The Department of the Air Force announced the selection of Eielson as the host facility for this pilot reactor on Oct. 18, 2021. The base is situated deep within the interior of Alaska near the city of Fairbanks and is around 110 miles south of the Arctic Circle. It is home to the active-duty 354th Fighter Wing, which flies F-35A Joint Strike Fighters and F-16 Viper aggressor jets , as well as the Alaska Air National Guard’s 168th Air Refueling Wing with its KC-135 tankers , among other units. F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, F-16 Viper aggressors, and KC-135 tankers on the runway at Eielson during an “Elephant Walk” combat readiness exercise in December 2020., USAF “Energy is a critical asset to ensure mission continuity at our installations,” Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Environment, Safety, and Infrastructure Mark Correll said in a statement. “Micro-reactors are a promising technology for ensuring energy resilience and reliability, and are particularly well-suited for powering and heating remote domestic military bases like Eielson AFB.” It is not clear exactly what the specifications might be for the reactor that is now set to be constructed at Eielson, which will be Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certified and contractor-owned and operated , or when it might first go critical or reach its full expected power output. The Air Force did say that the project in question had been initiated in response to language in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2019 Fiscal Year and that the goal is for the micro-reactor to be fully operational by the end of 2027. This would seem to indicate that this reactor is the one that the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) is leading the development of as part of an effort known as Project Pele . The goal of that project, which started in 2019 and that you can read more about here , is to demonstrate a small reactor capable of producing between one and five megawatts of power. By comparison, typical civilian nuclear power plants generate hundreds or even thousands of megawatts . The microreactor Project Pele is seeking is small in terms of power generation even compared to the compact designs used in nuclear-powered submarines, such as the 40-megawatt class S9G used in the U.S. Navy’s Virginia class boats. The Project Pele reactor will also use Tri-structural Isotropic (TRISO) fuel. “Each TRISO particle is made up of a uranium, carbon, and oxygen fuel kernel,” an official Department of Energy news item explains . “The kernel is encapsulated by three layers of carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products.” TRISO nuclear fuels are typically described as offering higher performance than comparable amounts of traditional fissile material used in power plants, as well as being safer to use and handle. This, in turn, enables the development of more compact, but also more reliable, reactors. In March, the Pentagon awarded contracts for prototype Project Pele reactors to X-Energy and BWX Technologies . These deals cover the continued maturation of the respective designs over the next two years, with the expectation being that a winning design will be selected afterward. The hope is that work on an actual microreactor will begin by the end of the 2022 Fiscal Year. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0OO6BwMqN1k The Air Force also did not detail the reasons behind why it chose Eielson for this project, but the Department of Defense , the Department of Energy , and independent organizations have all suggested it as a potential location for microreactor testing in the past. Its location and existing power infrastructure — it has its own coal-fired power plant already — have long made it an attractive option. Inside Eielson’s existing coal-fired power plant., USAF All told, the facility is a good representation of remote power generation challenges, broadly, as well as logistical and other impacts as a result of the continued reliance on fossil fuels. With regard to the latter issue, the U.S. military has increasingly highlighted the potential security risks presented by global climate change in recent years, and there have been numerous initiatives to reduce fossil fuel use across the services. Global climate change has also been a major factor in opening up access to new resources and trade routes in the Arctic, which has led to increased competition and growing concerns about the potential for conflict in the region . That, in turn, has increased the strategic significance of U.S. military bases in Alaska, including Eielson . For Eielson, specifically, the use of coal presents environmental and cost issues related to the base’s power plant itself and the infrastructure necessary to support it. For instance, the Air Force owns a fleet of diesel locomotives that are dedicated to bringing the base trainloads of coal, as well as other supplies, on a regular basis. One of the Air Force’s EMD GP40-2 diesel locomotives that support operations at Eielson. , USAF “The winter sees the highest level of sustained power, about 13 to 15 MWe [megwatts of electric capacity], using up to 800 tons of coal per day,” according to a 2018 report from the independent Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI). “The base maintains a 90 day supply of coal on site, and the plant has a thaw shed to de-freeze the coal prior to use.” Coal stored in outdoor piles at Eielson., USAF Eielson’s location, combined with the fact that it is a major Air Force base, presents certain benefits with regard to security and regulatory concerns, as well. “It should also be noted that numerous stakeholders have recommended that the first microreactor project in Alaska should be at a military base, possibly Eielson Air Force Base,” where “DOD is not required to comply with State law,” a report from the Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, which was released in January, notes. It is important to remember that Project Pele’s goal is not just to develop a small reactor to help power established facilities, but also one that could be readily deployable, including to forward locations on an actual battlefield . The idea is that this could streamline logistics and reduce costs for operations that currently rely on large, regular deliveries of gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. A graphic depicting a notional concept of operation involving the deployment and use of a mobile nuclear reactor in a battlefield context., DOD Though advocates point to the increased reliability offered by modern TRISO-fueled micro-reactor designs, there remain various other safety and security concerns, including what might happen if such a reactor is hit by incoming fire or captured by hostile actors. TRISO fuel is also touted as offering benefits when it comes to general environmental concerns, including the matter of waste byproducts . At the same time, it is worth pointing out that 19,780 acres associated with Eielson are already designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a so-called “ Superfund site ,” due to existing toxic chemical contamination related to “closed and active unlined landfills, shallow trenches where weathered tank sludge was buried, a drum storage area, and other disposal and spill areas.” Recently, the base also has been identified as one that suffers from contamination as a result of the use of firefighting foams containing perfluorinated compounds. “Public sentiment might affect potential decisions” when it comes to where to test micro-reactors, the January 2021 ACEP report notes. The actual establishment of the micro-reactor plant at Eielson is still likely years away, in which time public sentiment and other factors could well impact the plan and its schedule. At the same time, the U.S. military, as a whole, is very interested in the potential that small reactors hold for providing large amounts of cost-effective power to support future battlefield operations and more routine day-to-day activities.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 31, 2021",B-1 Bombers Deploy To Diego Garcia For The First Time In Over 15 Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. B-1B Lancer strategic bombers from the U.S. Air Force are back at the remote island outpost of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, for the first time since 2006. The ‘Bones’ were sent halfway around the world to the remote airfield for a Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) Bomber Task Force (BTF) mission, part of a relatively new strategy of unpredictable bomber deployments the service has implemented. They arrive at a time when tensions in the wider Asia-Pacific region are at a high, including as a result of significant Chinese activity in the Taiwan Strait . The Pentagon announced the deployment of the B-1s and around 200 airmen to Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, part of America’s sprawling military outpost in the British Indian Ocean Territory, yesterday. The bombers and crews are from the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota. An airman from the 37th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron marshals in a B-1B from Ellsworth Air Force Base, arriving in support of a Bomber Task Force mission at Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, on October 17., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Hannah Malone Although the Department of Defense has not cited the number of bombers at the island base, satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone shows three B-1s on the airfield as of October 18 and on October 21.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The B-1s arrived at Diego Garcia on October 17, based on captions for the imagery released by the DoD, while supporting flights by C-17A Globemaster III transports were carried out last week, moving 426,000 pounds and 90 items of materiel in the course of five shipments. Cargo from Ellsworth Air Force Base is prepared to be unloaded from a C-17 at Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, on October 15. The total cargo for the mission totaled five shipments of 426,000 pounds and 90 pieces of material., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Hannah Malone As already noted, the last time that B-1s were at Diego Garcia was in 2006. That deployment included an accident on May 6 of that year, in which one of the bombers, serial number 86-0132, sustained serious damage when it made a wheels-up landing . B-1s, as well as B-52s , and, to a lesser extent, B-2 stealth bombers , all made use of Diego Garcia for strikes in Afghanistan during the first decade of the Global War On Terror, before for bomber operations were moved closer to the action at bases in the Middle East . “Bomber Task Force missions, in support of [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command’s] operational and strategic objectives, are extremely valuable to our aircrew because of the multi-country integration opportunities,” said Lieutenant Colonel Ross Hobbs, 37th Bomb Squadron director of operations, in a statement released by the DoD regarding this new B-1 deployment to Diego Garcia. “They also give us the opportunity to showcase the unmatched range, speed, and lethality of the B-1.” “Global B-1 operations not only provide strategic deterrence to our nation’s adversaries but also strong, palpable assurance to our allies,” added Hobbs. The planned length of the deployment and the types of missions the B-1s will fly from Diego Garcia have not been revealed, although the Pentagon promises “multiple sorties […] in support of multiple geographic combatant command objectives and training requirements.” Typically, BTF missions are billed as a way of demonstrating U.S. military commitment to its allies and partners in particular regions. Currently, B-1s are also deployed to RAF Fairford in England as part of a BTF mission in the European theater, which has so far involved long-range missions over the Black Sea, an area that’s seen recent tensions between NATO and Russia . The arrival of the B-1s on Diego Garcia does come amid a significant uptick in American and allied activity across the Pacific, including high-profile multinational exercises and the debut operational deployment by the British aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and its task group, Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21). Meanwhile, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force has been especially active in and around the Taiwan Strait recently, with a record-setting 56 PLA aircraft entering Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone , or ADIZ, on one day alone earlier this month. Airmen from the 28th Bomb Wing, Ellsworth Air Force Base, watch as a B-1B lands at Diego Garcia., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Hannah Malone While the B-1 has long been absent from Diego Garcia, in the meantime it has hosted other bomber types during BTF missions in recent years that have been related to increased geopolitical friction. In August last year, for example, it was the turn of three B-2s to deploy there, in a mission that seemed to be timed to coincide with a spike in tensions with China. You can read all about that deployment in this previous article . On that last occasion, the B-2s conducted simultaneous training missions with B-1s, although these latter were flown directly from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, to the Pacific and back without ever touching down in the region. Other B-1s flying from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, which regularly hosts Pacific BTF missions, were involved, as well. On a separate occasion during that deployment, one of the B-2s also conducted a sortie from Diego Garcia that appeared to take it to the Delamere Air Weapons Range in Australia. Cooperation with Australia may also be a feature of the B-1 deployment, reflecting the broader efforts to integrate more with key allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to deter China and otherwise respond to regional security challenges. That same thinking has also helped drive the recent AUKUS initiative, which stands for Australia-United Kingdom-United States, and which includes cooperation in areas including nuclear-powered submarines , long-range strike capabilities , cyber warfare, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing . The last time B-2s were at Diego Garcia they made use of a new mobile operations center . This readily deployable command post is an essential component of new expeditionary concepts of operations for the stealth bombers, expanding the number of operating locations available to them. It could also be the case that the command post will benefit the B-1, further enabling the kinds of short-notice deployments to austere locations that are becoming increasingly relevant to the U.S. strategy in the Pacific. Elements of the new new mobile operations center support B-2 operations at Diego Garcia in August 2020., U.S. Air Force Earlier in 2020, Diego Garcia played host to six B-52 Stratofortress bombers. As we observed at the time , the basing decision looked to have been made, at least in part, to put the aircraft beyond the reach of Iran’s ballistic missiles , as tensions with that country flared during the final weeks of the Trump administration. Although the Air Force is preparing for a future without the B-1, and recently retired 17 examples, the type is still due to receive various upgrades , including the integration of new weapons capabilities, such as the ability to carry conventional standoff missiles and hypersonic weapons on new external pylons . As such, it remains an important strategic asset. Famously, the ‘Bone’ carries the largest conventional weapons payload of any aircraft in the Air Force. Included among this is the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM, which provides a potent anti-ship capability that has particular resonance as a counter to the growing PLA Navy in the Pacific. U.S Air Force Captain Anthony “NERO” Carbone, 37th Bomb Squadron weapons and tactics officer, descends down the ladder of a B-1B at Diego Garcia, October 17, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Hannah Malone With that in mind, the B-1’s return to the Pacific could be part of a larger effort to not only send a message to the regimes in Beijing and Pyongyang but also assure American allies and partners in the region. We don’t know for how long the B-1s will be operating out of Diego Garcia but it’s likely the Air Force will again seek to demonstrate the aircraft’s long-range capabilities across the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, Diego Garcia’s strategic location not only gives the ‘Bones’ the option to exercise alongside various friendly regional powers but also places them firmly within reach of various potential hotspots, too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 15, 2021",New Short-Range Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile Tested By North Korea (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea says it has tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM, which it claims has significant maneuvering capabilities. The existence of the weapon in question, which is significantly smaller than previous North Korean SLBM designs , looks to be one that was only publicly disclosed at an exhibition in Pyongyang last week. That weapon had already drawn considerable interest after that event, with there being some debate over whether it was an old, but previously unseen design or a new one that might be about to be tested. The launch occurred on Oct. 19, 2021, and took place near North Korea’s main submarine hub at Sinpo on the country’s eastern coast. South Korean media reports said that the missile reportedly flew between 430 and 450 kilometers , or 267 to 280 miles, reaching an apogee of 60 kilometers, or around 37 miles, before landing in the East Sea. South Korean officials had earlier said that they believed the test had involved an SLBM, while their American counterparts had stated they were aware of the launch, but declined to say what type of missile might have been fired. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also reportedly said that his country had assessed that the North Koreans had launched two missiles, which does not appear to have been the case. One of a series of pictures North Korean state media released of the SLBM test on Oct. 19, 2021., North Korean state media North Korean state media North Korean state media North Korean state media An example, or possible mockup, of the submarine-launched missile that was tested earlier today at an arms exhibition in Pyongyang last week., North Korean state media “The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Defense Science Institute conducted a test launch of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile on the 19th,” according to an official announcement about the test from North Korea’s state media. “With the pride and honor of successfully launching the first submarine-launched strategic ballistic missile five years ago and successfully launching a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile in the ‘Hero ship August 24’, which demonstrated the military strength of the Republic, it is proud and proud of its loyalty to the Party Central Committee. said to have reported.” It’s not entirely clear how the missile in question was tested. North Korean state media released a picture of the country’s lone Gorae class submarine , which has been used for SLBM tests in the past , surfacing along with the pictures of the as-yet-unnamed weapon apparently being launched from underwater. The photograph of the submarine appeared to show its launch hatch in its sail open. At the same time, satellite imagery had also indicated that a barge at Sinpo that has been used for underwater SLBM test launches in the past might have been out to sea on Oct. 18. A picture of North Korea’s Gorae class submarine that was released with the other pictures of this latest SLBM test, which appears to show the submarine’s launch hatch open., North Korean state media “The Academy of Defense Science announced that the new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile with many advanced control guidance technologies, including lateral maneuvers and glide jump maneuvers, will greatly contribute to the advancement of the nation’s defense technology,” North Korea state media added. The North Koreans did not provide any additional details or imagery to substantiate those claims about the missile’s performance. The mention of a “glide jump maneuver” sounds likely to refer to what are often described as “porpoise” or “skip-glide” maneuvers, wherein the entire weapon or a separate reentry vehicle brakes by tipping its nose up, creating an irregular, step-down trajectory during the terminal phase of flight. This can offer a way to make course corrections, as well as to extend the weapon’s overall range, and to simply make it more difficult to intercept. A graphic associated with a Chinese short-range anti-ship ballistic missile that depicts a “porpoise” or “skip-glide” trajectory in the terminal state of flight. This appears to be the kind of maneuvering capability, in broad strokes, that North Korea claims its latest SLBM possesses., Chinese internet A maneuvering re-entry vehicle of some kind that detaches from the rest of the missile in flight might help explain Prime Minister Kishida’s statement that Japanese authorities had detected two missiles, rather than one, but that comment could also have just been in error. The North Koreans have publicly shown ground-launched ballistic missiles with what appear to be maneuvering warheads in the past. Otherwise, this test would seem to confirm initial analysis that this missile has relatively short-range. The fact that the official North Korean state media release does not appear to describe this weapon as “strategic” raises the possibility that it could be conventionally armed or at least have the option of carrying a non-nuclear warhead. A conventionally-armed SLBM, just like one South Korea recently tested , could be valuable for striking hardened, high-value targets. As The War Zone already noted when the missile first emerged publicly last week, its small size could allow for smaller North Korean submarines to be converted to fire it. It could offer larger North Korean types, such as the Gorae class boat or a Romeo class diesel-electric attack submarine that is being converted into a type capable of firing ballistic missiles, the ability to carry more such weapons at once, a well. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other officials seen in 2019 in front of a Romeo class submarine that is under conversion into a type capable of carrying ballistic missiles., North Korean state media A more limited range compared to other North Korean SLBMs would not necessarily be a factor for engaging targets in South Korea or even possibly Japan. Multiple small submarines equipped with shorter-range SLBMs would enable more survivable strikes on various targets from different vectors, presenting additional challenges for the country’s opponents. Regardless of the weapon’s capabilities, a test of a new North Korean SLBM is significant. This is the first North Korean SLBM test, at least that we know about, since 2019 . The country also unveiled another new SLBM design, identified as the Pukguksong-5 , which is larger than previous types, in January, but there are no reports that it has been tested to date. As already noted, this test follows South Korea conducting the first trials of its own conventionally-armed SLBM from the first of its Dosan Ahn Changho class diesel-electric attack submarines in September. The two Koreas have otherwise been increasingly locked in an arms race, with both countries having disclosed tests , or at least publicly shown , a number of new ballistic and cruise missile designs in recent weeks. Just prior to this test, North Korea had claimed to have tested another missile carrying a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. This latest North Korean SLBM launch also came after Sung Kim, U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea, met with his South Korean counterpart Noh Kyu Duk, in Washington, D.C. Kim is due to travel to South Korea later this week where he is expected to talk further with officials there about potential ways to restart talks with the regime in Pyongyang on various issues, including its nuclear weapons and missile programs. “The United States condemns the DPRK’s ballistic missile launch. These launches are a violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and are a threat to the region,” the U.S. State Department had said in an earlier statement to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. “We call on the DPRK to refrain from further provocations and engage in sustained and substantive dialogue. Our commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad.” North Korean officials have recently shown some interest in talks , at least superficially, especially regarding humanitarian aid and potential sanctions relief. At the same time, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made clear at the arms expo last week that his regime sees its continued arms buildup, and the testing that goes with it, such as this latest SLBM launch, as its fundamental right in the face of what he said was South Korean and American aggression. UPDATE: Hi-resolution images have been released. You can see the large endplate being blown off in the upper left image: KCNA These higher resolution pictures provide a closer look at the missile itself, which has numerous external similarities to a ground-launched North Korean short-range ballistic missile known as the KN-23 . The new North Korean SLBM may well be a submarine-launched derivative of the KN-23.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",The Navy Practiced Battle Damage Repairs On The Burnt-Out USS Bonhomme Richard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship, the former USS Bonhomme Richard , which was removed from service following a devastating fire last year, performed one final duty when it hosted a battle damage repair exercise before being scrapped. The salvage exercise took place using the hulk of the warship as it was under tow in the Gulf of Mexico and should ensure that crews are better able to deal with these kinds of situations, should they occur in the future, in peacetime, or during a conflict. According to Seapower Magazine , the battle damage repair drill was run this summer when the Bonhomme Richard was around 300 miles from its final destination, Brownsville, Texas, where it was brought for scrapping , after having much of its superstructure removed in its homeport of San Diego, California. The former amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard under tow earlier this year, heading from Naval Base San Diego, California, to Brownsville, Texas., @SANDIEGOWEBCAM VIA @WARSHIPCAM Among the sailors involved in the exercise were mobile diving and salvage personnel and divers. Essentially, battle damage repair teams, including operational forces, mobile diving, and salvage elements, are the first line of response if a warship suffers serious damage, regardless of how it’s inflicted. Their job is to contain the damage, stabilize the vessel, and ensure that it can be brought to one of the Navy’s regional maintenance centers or a public shipyard for more extensive repair work. “All of the NAVSEA [Naval Sea Systems Command] commands [and] fleet commands were involved, said Rear Admiral Eric Ver Hage, commander of the Regional Maintenance Center and director of Surface Ship Maintenance and Modernization for NAVSEA. “They were able to cut metal, flood spaces, de-water spaces, patch the holes at sea; it was really, really realistic,” Ver Hage told the American Society of Naval Engineers Fleet Maintenance and Modernization Symposium, Seapower Magazine reported. Rear Admiral Eric Ver Hage (right) discusses high-energy laser testing at Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD)., U.S. Navy Ver Hage also confirmed that the exercise aboard the Bonhomme Richard was likely the first of a number of similar efforts, all with the goal of boosting the Navy’s ability to conduct battle damage repair quickly and effectively. These kinds of skills would be paramount during any kind of large-scale conflict in which American warships were under threat, as well as in response to terror attacks or in other asymmetric scenarios. “We’re going to do more of that,” the admiral said, in reference to this summer’s battle damage repair exercise. Ver Hage provided the example of the al-Qaeda attack on the Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden in October 2000, in which suicide terrorists exploded a small boat alongside the warship as it was refueling, killing 17 American sailors, injuring many more, and causing considerable damage to the vessel. Port-side view showing the damage sustained by the USS Cole on October 12, 2000., via U.S. Navy As well as the terror threat, which has only increased since 2000, the new era of great power competition is increasingly putting the United States on a collision course with China and, in particular, its maritime interests, and growing naval might , in the wider Asia Pacific region. At the same time, the Russian Navy is diminished compared to its Soviet predecessor, but is increasingly active, including closer to U.S. shores . Meanwhile, the example of the USS Bonhomme Richard shows that battle damage repair skills are just as important in peacetime . According to Ver Hage, use was made of innovative tools to help tackle the fire , including expertise from the oil and gas industry, drones for close-in inspection, and firefighting helicopters, among them Navy Seahawks that made 1,649 water drops over a four-day period. However, the Navy ultimately identified a catalog of errors in the response to the Bonhomme Richard fire. Details of the investigation report demonstrate that the crew was unprepared to deal with the fire, which was allegedly started deliberately by a sailor while the warship was undergoing maintenance. Firefighters tackle the blaze aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard in port in San Diego., COMMANDER, NAVAL SURFACE FORCE—PUBLIC DOMAIN “Although the fire was started by an act of arson, the ship was lost due to an inability to extinguish the fire,” Vice Admiral Scott Conn, the former U.S. 3rd Fleet commander stated in his investigation, details of which were first reported by USNI News . Earlier this summer, and prior to the release of the Bonhomme Richard investigation, the Government Accountability Office also highlighted the Navy’s deficiencies in repairing battle-damaged warships, especially in high-intensity combat operations against advanced adversaries. “Navy officials we interviewed generally agreed that the Navy could handle a single battle damage event but were uncertain how the Navy might handle multiple simultaneous or near-simultaneous events,” the report stated . The loss of a U.S. Navy warship is today a rare occurrence. Compared to more than 350 warships and patrol craft sunk or damaged beyond repair during World War II, less than 30 have been subject to the same fates after 1945, according to figures published by USNI . However, as Ver Hage, the Government Accountability Office, and others now warn, this situation could change for the worse in the future. A reminder of more dangerous times: the destroyer escort USS Fiske (DE-143) after it was torpedoed by a German U-boat north of the Azores on August 2, 1944. Thirty-three of the crew died and 50 more were badly wounded.   , U.S. Navy As Commander Leineweber, officer-in-charge of Amphibious Construction Battalion Two, Detachment 113, at Navy Operational Support Center, wrote in the August 2020 issue of Proceedings : “If the United States goes to war with a peer adversary, some warships will suffer severe combat damage. Consider that it took nearly two years to repair the USS John S. McCain (DDG-56) and USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) following their 2017 collisions. In a fight with China for control of the Pacific, the United States will not have that long to get ships back in the fight. Taking years for repairs could cause the United States to lose the next war not long after the first major naval engagement.” The guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald in dry dock at Yokosuka, Japan, for repairs and damage assessments, in 2017, after a collision with a merchant vessel., U.S. Navy/Petty Officer 2nd Class Christian Senyk Ver Hage’s plans call for battle damage repairs to be practiced using former Navy ships that have been selected to be destroyed as targets in sink exercises, or SINKEX, of the kind that you can read more about here and here . In this way, the Navy’s ability to deal with any future fires, as well as other kinds of contingencies, should be enhanced. But many questions still remain, including just how badly damaged or degraded in terms of mission effectiveness a warship would have to be before being taken out of commission during a conflict. By being able to fix ships, even in the most basic ways, more quickly, the idea of what is a battle-worthy vessel may begin to change substantially.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 21, 2021",Surface To Air Missiles Now Needed To Protect Critical U.S. Infrastructure During A Crisis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior officer at the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, says the command is actively engaged in discussions about how to optimize air-defense capabilities, including ground-based surface-to-air missiles , to protect domestic critical infrastructure in a crisis. He said that the growing ability of potential adversaries to launch long-range conventional strikes, especially using advanced air , sea, and submarine-launched cruise missiles , has prompted new concerns about threats to the homeland, which is “not a sanctuary any longer.” This is just the latest example of U.S. officials sounding similar alarms bells in recent years — but it is a less common public acknowledgment about the limitations of existing defenses within the continental United States. U.S. Air Force Colonel Kristopher Struve, the vice director of operations for NORAD, discussed domestic critical infrastructure defense during a virtual roundtable on air and missile defense that the Missile Defense Advocacy Association (MDAA) hosted yesterday. Struve took the place of Air Force Brigadier General Paul Murray, NORAD’s Deputy Director of Operations, who had been “called into a four-star meeting,” according to MDAA Chairman and Founder Riki Ellison. A Patriot Advanced Capability 3 interceptor (PAC-3) at the moment of launch. Patriot surface-to-air missile systems are among those that the US military could deploy to protect critical infrastructure in a crisis, according to NORAD., DOD With regard to critical infrastructure protection, Struve laid out the current situation in the following way: Our potential adversaries have created significant capacity to reach us asymmetrically. Our forward layers, our allies, our partners, our forward combatant commands and geographic commands, have largely kept those threats away from the United States. But as we look into threats from cyber actors , space threats , as well as kinetic conventional cruise missiles , which have [seen] significant improvement on the part of China and Russia in recent years, those create avenues that can create havoc in the homeland while we are trying to project our power forward to potentially a regional conflict. So, the thing that I really want to emphasize here is that the homeland is not a sanctuary any longer. There are opportunities for our adversaries to employ weapons from distances that they could strike critical infrastructure in the United States early in a conflict and create some challenges for us to produce our military power. And when we look at our deterrence model, we’ve had a lot of capability since really World War II to have deterrence by punishment. That nuclear deterrent is the underpinning of our entire deterrence model. And it’s that ability for us to respond in kind and protect our homeland. But as our adversaries have built the capability to strike us conventionally, they feel like that they have [an] opportunity below the nuclear threshold to strike us and potentially keep that conflict from going nuclear. And it is this avenue where we really need to work to close gaps and be able to protect the homeland more completely. … Something that I haven’t really talked about is what are we doing on the risk mitigation front, and that’s the ability for us to actually defend. And there’s two sides that we think about when we think risk mitigation. It’s our ability to deny those threats, and, when we talk about these kinetic conventional weapons, it’s hardening, redundancy, resiliency on some of our critical infrastructure. Not every piece of our infrastructure is going to be taken out with one of these conventional-size weapons, but some things are particularly vulnerable. So we view this as a whole-of-government approach on being able to protect that infrastructure. And then, after that, we would place defenses on key critical infrastructure nodes. It’s infeasible that we can place kinetic, you know, surface-to-air missile batteries over the entirety of the United States, Alaska , the Aleutian Islands , and Canada. By the time we fielded such a system, it would probably — they would’ve found a way around it anyways. So we are working closely with OSD [Office of the Secretary of Defense] and the National Security Council on where are we going to place those limited ground-based air defense assets that we’ll have in time of conflict to really change our adversaries’ calculus about their efficacy of being able to execute an attack on the U.S. That can be everything from how we’re organized today, which would be our fighter aircraft at more than a dozen, a couple dozen locations across the U.S., that can intercept conventional cruise missiles with mixes of AESA and non-AESA fighters , as well as Alaska and Canada. It’s our limited area defenses, you know Patriot-type missile systems that we can deploy in time of crisis. But it’s also our persistent capability that we currently employ in specific areas, such as the National Capital Region . Those are systems that, based on increasing threats from both the air and sea, that we need to be able to continue to develop, generate, and put in those key critical infrastructure locations so that we can change the calculus of our adversaries. You can watch the entire roundtable discussion via YouTube below. Struve was correct in saying that it would be a costly and time-consuming endeavor to establish a nationwide surface-to-air missile network that enemies would undoubtedly develop counter-countermeasures against. Unlike some other countries, including many potential adversaries, such as China , the United States does not currently have SAMs strategically deployed on a permanent basis across the country. The U.S. military did have this kind of integrated network of SAM sites for a time during the Cold War but had shut them all down by the end of the 1970s. At the same time, what is left unsaid here is that the U.S. military simply does not have anywhere near the capacity at present to deploy ground-based air and missile defenses to protect every key piece of infrastructure in the United States. As it stands, the only real “persistent capability” in this regard that the United States does have in place, as Struve noted, is in the National Capital Region (NCR). This air-defense force consists of batteries equipped with the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS), which uses the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), and fixed and Humvee-mobile versions of the Avenger system , each armed with Stinger short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, as well as a .50-caliber machine gun. Various radars and other sensors systems are positioned in the NCR to detect a variety of different types of threats. The US military’s NASAMS are notoriously shy. This picture shows a launch unit belonging to a Dutch system firing an AIM-120 missile., Dutch Ministry of Defense The photograph in the Tweet below, taken during an incident in 2019 , shows a fixed Avenger system in Washington, D.C. Otherwise, the U.S. Army has around 18 Air Defense Artillery Battalions equipped with Patriot , the service’s main surface-to-air missile system. Each one of these battalions has between three and five batteries, depending on their exact composition. Last October, elements of the 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, out of Fort Hood in Texas, conducted a training exercise that saw them deploy to a commercial airport. This, in part, demonstrated how Patriot batteries could be sent to protect nonmilitary sites. Elements of the Army’s 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment at Easterwood Airport in College Station, Texas, in October 2020., READER SUBMISSION However, not all the Army’s Patriot units are available to be deployed inside the United States in a crisis. Five of them are overseas on a permanent basis — two in Germany, two in South Korea, and one in Japan. Two more are dedicated training units. The Army has some six more batteries of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems designed to engage incoming ballistic missiles, one of which is permanently based on Guam and another of which is forward-deployed to South Korea . A transporter-erector-launcher belonging to the Army’s THAAD battery on Guam., US Army The service just recently established two more batteries with the Israeli-made Iron Dome system, which focuses primarily on cruise missile defense. One of those units is now headed for a temporary experimental deployment to Guam . In September, the Army awarded a contract to defense contractor Dynetics for the purchase of a similar system, known as Enduring Shield , to meet cruise missile defense and other requirements. A truck-mounted launcher from one of the U.S. Army’s two Iron Dome batteries., US Army The Army and the Marine Corps have additional units equipped with Avengers, as well as shoulder-fired Stingers , that could provide point defenses around various sites, including against incoming cruise missiles. The Army is also in the process of fielding a new short-range air-defense system based on the Stryker 8×8 wheeled armored vehicle, which has Stingers, as well as Hellfire missiles and a 30mm automatic cannon. Additional systems, including ones equipped with directed-energy weapons , are now in development . It’s important to remember that, during an actual crisis, demand for these relatively limited ground-based air-defense assets would also come from commanders around the world, who would be faced with a multitude of air and missile threats themselves. Beyond cruise and ballistic missiles , drones (including various tiers of armed types ) present very real threats now to troops on battlefields abroad and at home , as well. The drone and missile strikes on oil-related infrastructure in Saudi Arabia back in 2019 provided a particularly notable wake-up call about these issues. The War Zone has, on multiple occasions, specifically highlighted the potential danger that small drones pose to American domestic critical infrastructure , as well as U.S. military activities . Struve did rightly point out that American fighter jets , as well as their Canadian counterparts , provide the primary layer of air and missile defense, including against incoming cruise missiles . However, one of his fellow panelists at the MDAA roundtable, Air Force Col. Jason Nalepa, the commander of the 173rd Operations Group, part of the Oregon Air National Guard’s 173rd Fighter Wing , noted the “tyranny of distance” that limits how quickly fighters can respond to threats after scrambling from their bases around North America. In addition, those jets simply can’t be in every place at once and only carry so many missiles , further underscoring the importance of ground-based assets positioned at or near critical sites to provide additional layers of more localized protection. Air Force Col. Jason Nalepa, head of the Oregon Air National Guard’s 173rd Operations Group, shared this unclassified map during the MDAA virtual roundtable, which shows various NORAD air defense nodes. The green circles indicate bases that host Air Force fighter jets, including those assigned to Air National Guard units, tasked with the homeland defense mission., DOD All this clearly requires the kinds of discussions that Struve says are happening now about how the U.S. military can best use the assets available to mitigate increasing risks, particularly from conventional long-range cruise missiles that can be launched from aircraft , submarines , and ships , including even potentially non-descript commercial cargo vessels . His comments also raise clear questions about how the United States can and should expand its capacity to provide air and missile defenses domestically going forward. In addition, NORAD’s vice director of operations highlighted the importance of existing integrated sensor networks, such as the North Warning System , along with future ones and other forms of intelligence in detecting potential threats or even helping to prevent crises from turning into full-blown conflicts, to begin with. “What we really need to be able to have is a complete, integrated system of … sensors, from the sea floor to on orbit, that are going to be able to detect any type of one of those threats, so that we can have that warning capacity to be able to inform our national leadership and take action,” he said. “We’re also working heavily in the information dominance phase, and that would be the ability to take data from old sensors that were specifically calibrated [to detect certain threats] and [that] leave about 90% plus of their data on the cutting room floor… [and] being able to put [new] back-end processing on some of those sensors,” he added. There is a desire to “integrate that with… ‘ left-of-launch ‘ intelligence, to be able to give us more time and space … something that every commander needs to be able to deescalate a conflict,” as well. Since 9/11, NORAD has been working toward fielding new and improved distributed sensor and networking capabilities, as well as additional interception capacity, first under the Homeland Defense Design effort and now under a new overarching initiative known as the Strategic Homeland Integrated Ecosystems for Layered Defense (SHIELD). One of SHIELD’s more notably “spiral” developments has been the integration of new AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radars, a new active electronically scanned array type, onto Air Force F-16C/D fighter jets, giving them improved abilities to spot and engage various threats, including low-flying cruise missiles. You can read more about this project here . The development and fielding of new or improved surface-to-air missile systems are reportedly among SHIELD’s goals, as well. “The SHIELD strategy seeks ways to reduce costs by optimizing for defense of domestic locations,” according to a story Air Force Magazine published in January. “Patriot surface-to-air missile defense systems, for example, were originally designed to protect Army units while on the move.” “They’re built to travel over rough terrain and hardened to operate through chemical or biological attacks,” it continued. “NORAD believes it can cut costs by stripping out some of those features while retaining its advanced fire-control system.” SHIELD would also seem to present increased demand for new, shorter-range systems, such as Dynetics’ Enduring Shield. However, these types of air defense systems would only be able to cover relatively small areas. This, in turn, would require the purchase of a larger number of them to ensure that they would be available in the quantities necessary to provide any sort of robust coverage domestically, as well as meet demands for commanders downrange. In the meantime, the U.S. military’s plan clearly is to prepare to deploy air-defense assets available now to protect critical infrastructure, if necessary. However, as NORAD’s Struve notes, the limited number of surface-to-air missile systems means, at least for the foreseeable future, that there will have to be discussions about what sites would get additional protective shields during an actual crisis.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 22, 2021",AH-1 Cobra Helicopter Gunships Turned Firefighters Have Flown Their Last Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An iconic aircraft has been stood down from its duty in support of aerial firefighting operations, with the retirement of the adapted AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships operated for almost two decades by the U.S. Forest Service. The red-and-white painted AH-1s had been used as firewatch aircraft, using a variety of sensors to monitor the progress of wildfires and report their progress to firefighters on the ground, as well as to help coordinate operations. The two firewatch AH-1s were officially retired last Saturday, according to the Fire Aviation website. The Cobras were ex-U.S. Army AH-1F gunships that had been supported in their new civilian mission using spare parts from the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. Originally, the U.S. Forest Service acquired 25 former U.S. Army AH-1Fs, with most of the others being stored at Davis-Monthan. Despite this reserve of parts, the active helicopters were showing their age, with maintenance becoming increasingly challenging for the aircraft. The final two firewatch Cobra airframes were originally built in 1969 and 1983. With all remaining easily accessible parts having been expended, it was considered no longer cost-effective to keep the Cobras flying. It’s important to remember these single-engine Cobra variants have more in common with those that saw action in the Vietnam War and during the Cold War than they do the twin-engine AH-1s that have been flown in combat by the U.S. Marine Corps in recent years, the now-retired AH-1W , and the current AH-1Z . That said, with the aid of comprehensive upgrades , AH-1F variants do remain in frontline military service outside the United States. Despite their unique characteristics, the U.S. Forest Service is adamant that their retirement won’t adversely affect firefighting in the region. “There is no reduction in firefighting surveillance or operational capabilities with the transition,” the organization told Fire Aviation . “Local communities and wildland firefighters will be better served by the advancements in modern technology. [The two Cobras] served the Forest Service for 19 years and reached their maximum lifespan after flying approximately 7,600 flight hours with the Cobra program.” Footage from the latest fire season in California, including firewatch Cobras in action: The firewatch Cobras were uniquely equipped for their task. According to Fire Aviation , the AH-1s “were outfitted with infrared sensors so that they can be used for close intelligence support for ground troops, GIS [geographic information system] mapping, real-time color video, geo-referenced infrared, and infrared downlink.” The infrared sensors comprised a FLIR Star SAFIRE 380-HDc gimbal on each helicopter. These, according to the sensor manufacturer , allow the flight crew “to see through smoke, report real-time fire progression, provide tactical infrared capabilities to enhance ground resources’ situational awareness, and keep incident management apprised of critical holding issues.” The ability to see through smoke, in particular, was a major advantage when the firewatch Cobra appeared on the scene. Thermal image captured by a FLIR Star SAFIRE 380-HDc sensor., TELEDYNE FLIR In addition to intelligence gathering, they were also used as a platform for an Air Tactical Group Supervisor (ATGS) or a Helicopter Coordinator, essentially serving as an on-scene coordinator for aerial firefighting operations. A U.S. Forest Service Cobra in action at Fox Field, Lancaster, California, during the 2007 wildfires., Akradecki/Wikimedia Commons In an earlier report about the Cobras, Fire Aviation explained , “The Cobras have a ROVER system that can transmit and receive data to and from a hand-held device about the size of an iPad mini, but not as thin as an iPad. For example, an Operations Section Chief could draw on a map on the screen of the portable device to illustrate where he wants an air-drop, or the location of a stream that needs to be protected from retardant drops, and his drawings would show up on a screen in front of the pilot. The data is carried by a microwave link.” ROVER, or Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver, has encompassed several generations since its introduction in the mid-2000s and was essentially the first system of its kind to provide a robust means of sharing visual information between forward air controllers on the ground and military aircraft. The many advantages that the system offers on the battlefield can equally be exploited to combat wildfires. This walkaround of one of the last two firewatch Cobras is well worth a watch: The U.S. Forest Service confirmed also that the same kinds of capabilities will be introduced to a “high-performance Type III helicopter for next fire season.” According to the National Interagency Fire Center classification, Type III helicopters are typically small and fast and are expected to arrive on the scene of an initial wildfire outbreak faster than other rotorcraft. In addition, they should be capable of carrying four to five firefighters at a time, and use a 180-gallon water bucket, although it’s not clear if the intended replacement for the AH-1 will also have transport and water-drop capabilities. In addition, it’s expected that the U.S. Forest Service will rely more heavily in the future on fixed-wing aircraft that can monitor a broader area, as well as drones, which are becoming an increasingly important aerial firefighting tool. So, it’s farewell then, to the famous AH-1 Cobra in the firefighting role. Adapting these menacing rotorcraft for a peacetime mission is typical of the often innovative approaches that have been taken to tackling wildfires in North America and it’s hoped that their capabilities will continue to be provided by whatever helicopter type succeeds them.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2020",Turkey In Talks To Buy More F-16s As It Struggles To Revamp Fighter Fleet (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States has offered to sell Turkey another batch of F-16 fighter jets after the country was sensationally ejected from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in 2019 after purchasing Russian-made S-400 air defense systems . According to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the latest offer has been made to compensate for Turkey’s abortive $1.4-billion investment in the Joint Strike Fighter program, in which it was a significant provider of components, as well as planning to buy more than 100 examples for its own air force. The latest development in the fallout from Turkey’s decision to buy the S-400, despite considerable pressure from the United States, emerged yesterday and was quickly followed by reports from Russia, which has been pitching its own fighters to Turkey as an alternative to its traditional Western equipment. Elements associated with the S-400 air defense system arrive in Turkey in July 2019., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE “There is the payment of $1.4 billion we have made for the F-35s, and the U.S. had such a proposal in return for these payments,” Erdogan told reporters . “Regarding this, we said let’s take whatever steps are needed to be taken to meet the defense needs of our country,” he added. Reuters reported Erdogan as saying that talks with Washington on the issue are ongoing. The apparent U.S. offer follows reports from earlier this month that Ankara had requested the purchase of 40 new-build F-16 jets plus almost 80 upgrade kits for existing aircraft, as part of a planned air force modernization effort. In the past, Turkey has also made calls to have the $1.4 billion payments returned , as long as F-35 deliveries were suspended, but without success. At one time, the Turkish Air Force was expecting to receive more than 100 F-35s and deliveries of the first few aircraft to training units in the United States had begun when Ankara was removed from the program, a process that you can read all about in this previous War Zone story . The jets that had been completed for Turkey were subsequently diverted to the U.S. Air Force. The United States had repeatedly threatened action if Ankara did not abandon its purchase of S-400s. As well as ejection from the JSF program, Turkey was hit with U.S. sanctions, while Turkish defense officials — including the chief of the Defense Industry Directorate — were blacklisted. The unveiling ceremony for the first F-35A planned for Turkey, in June 2018., ANADOLU AGENCY Clearly, Erdogan now wants to recoup something from his country’s investment in the Joint Strike Fighter program after a complicated process to extract Turkish industry from the stealth fighter’s global supply chain. According to official reports, Turkish companies at one time supplied 1,005 parts for the F-35 airframe and engine. At the same time, the Turkish Air Force finds itself facing obsolescence issues, especially with regional rival Greece having acquired advanced Dassault Rafale fighters from France, with plans to acquire its own F-35 stealth fighters , too. With the delivery of its first Rafales, the Hellenic Air Force has opened up a qualitative gap with its Turkish rival., Dassault Aviation While Turkey does have its own indigenous fifth-generation fighter program , the TF-X has suffered delays and there are question marks about the viability of the aircraft and its subsystems. Back in 2019, the goal was to have a prototype of the TF-X complete by 2023 and the first flight in 2025. That ambitious timeline no longer appears feasible, with the costs and complexity inherent in the TF-X program now also compounded by the breakdown in relations with the United States, which would have supplied the General Electric F110 engines that were originally planned to power the fighter. A mock-up of the TF-X was unveiled at the Paris Air Show in 2019., TAI With the prospects for TF-X success looking less likely, at least in the near term, Turkey has made efforts to provide a stopgap replacement for the F-35, in the shape of a comprehensive local upgrade for its existing F-16 fleet. As we discussed earlier this year , a structural improvement program is now underway to extend the service lives of some of the oldest F-16s in the Turkish inventory. The Turkish Air Force remains the world’s third-largest Viper operator, with a total of 270 F-16s delivered in successively more capable Block 30, Block 50, and Block 50+ configurations. So important to the air force is the F-16, that Turkey reportedly began stockpiling spare parts for its Vipers in July 2019, even before sanctions were introduced. Buying a new batch of F-16s would also likely help keep the current fleet operational, ensuring a continued flow of spare parts and support from the United States. A Turkish Air Force maintainer participates in a scramble competition in support of the multinational Falcon Air Meet exercise in 2011., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Asha Kin The other fighter in the Turkish inventory is the Cold War-era F-4E, which now badly needs replacement, although these jets also underwent a significant mid-life upgrade, emerging as the Terminator 2020 . There could also be another potential home-grown solution to the Turkish fighter problem, with Turkish Aerospace also working on the Hürjet, a single-engine supersonic advanced trainer that can also be adapted as a light combat aircraft. The manufacture of the first prototype is due to begin before the end of this year . While the Hürjet similarly relies on an American-supplied engine, at least in its initial iteration, there are plenty of other light combat aircraft options that could provide a lower-cost way of modernizing the air force, although a solution of this kind would not help offset the capabilities offered by Greece’s Rafales and, potentially, F-35s. It could also be the case that, instead of getting more new-build Vipers, Turkey may opt for more upgrade packages for its existing F-16s. This would parallel Greece’s upgrade program, which is bringing 84 aircraft to Block 70/72 standard, which includes the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar ( SABR ), among other enhancements. The cost of that Greek deal has been estimated at around $1.5 billion. An artist’s conception of a Block 70/72 F-16 Viper., Lockheed Martin The Block 70/72 is the latest production configuration for the popular jet, with the related F-16V upgrade package bringing older jets up to a similar standard. In the future, Lockheed Martin plans to further “commoditize” its F-16 line with a single standardized configuration , with a standard base–price tag. All Vipers are now built at a dedicated Viper production line that has been moved from Texas to South Carolina. The new F-16 production line at Greenville, South Carolina., Lockheed Martin There are still hurdles, however, to be overcome before Turkey gets its hands on new F-16s from the United States. A potential sale could still be vetoed by the U.S. Congress, which would still be able to point to Turkey’s controversial acquisition of S-400 systems, which have now been tested against Turkish Air Force jets, including F-16s. As well as the S-400 issue, there have been other diplomatic clashes between Turkey and the United States in recent years. These include the country’s shift toward Moscow, expanding ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean, and its human rights record. Meanwhile, Turkish involvement in the conflict in Syria in 2019 led to calls for a full-on arms embargo from powerful members of Congress . Turkish President Recep Erdogan shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting over the conflict in Libya in January 2020., ALEKSEY NIKOLSKYI / SPUTNIK  VIA AP With these tensions in mind, Moscow has kept a close eye on Turkey’s fighter requirements and has offered both the multirole Su-35 and the advanced Su-57 in the past . Almost as soon as reports emerged of the latest negotiations over more F-16s for Turkey, Russia’s state-run TASS news agency reported that Turkey was looking at both the Su-35 and Su-57, in the event of the talks with the United States breaking down. “If the United States does not approve a deal on the F-16s after the situation with F-35 aircraft, Turkey won’t be left without alternatives,” Ismail Demir, the head of Turkey’s Defense Industry told the NTV television channel. “The issue of Su-35 and Su-57 planes may surface again at any time.” Putin and Erdogan inspect a Su-57 during the biennial MAKS air show outside of Moscow in 2019., MIKHAIL VOSKRESENSKIY / SPUTNIK VIA AP Although the United States has continued to issue warnings against Turkey buying any more Russian military hardware, Ankara has remained resolute, and Erdogan has even announced plans to buy a second batch of S-400s from Moscow. That, or a decision to buy Russian-made fighter jets, would likely trigger additional actions from Washington and further complicate the relationship between Washington and Ankara. As it stands, it’s not clear whether the new F-16 deal will make it through Congress, with bipartisan support calling for continued pressure to be put on Ankara, while Turkey has expressed hopes that relations can be restored with the Biden administration . But it seems certain that the repercussions of the S-400 deal will continue to be felt, whatever type of fighter Turkey chooses to revamp its inventory. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Update, October 18, 2:30 PM PST: In a briefing today, the U.S. State Department neither confirmed nor denied that an offer of additional F-16 jets had been made to Turkey. However, State Department spokesperson Ned Price did say that Washington had not made Turkey a financing offer for the aircraft. “We would refer you to the Turkish government to speak to its defense procurement plans,” Price added. “What I can say is the United States has not made any financing offers on Turkey’s F-16 request.” Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Forces F-16 Fighters Hellenic Air Force Turkish Air Force"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 16, 2020",Special Ops Train To Defend Strategic Aleutian Islands Radar Outpost During All-Out War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What would arguably be among target number one on American soil during an all-out conflict with a peer state such as China or Russia, Shemya Island sits in the Aleutian Island chain as America’s closest stronghold to Russia’s eastern flank. It is home to the powerful and now upgraded AN/FPS-108 Cobra Dane early warning and tracking radar used to spot incoming ballistic missile strikes. This, along with a number of other ancillary capabilities it provides, including a 10,000-foot runway and associated airfield infrastructure with plenty of ramp space and an emergency arresting gear system, makes Shemya an extremely important locale that is worth protecting. Training for just such a mission is exactly what is going on right now as part of NORAD’s Noble Defender wargames in Alaska. Shemya was a major player when it came to strategic surveillance during the Cold War. Beyond the Cobra Dane radar installation, detachments of RC-135 surveillance aircraft flew missions from the island throughout the Cold War, with Cobra Ball rocket and missile tracking aircraft standing alert from the unforgiving airfield all the way into the mid-1990s. You can read exactly what this operation was like from someone who flew Cobra Balls from Sheyma in this past feature of ours . Shemya Island. The airfield, Eareckson Air Station, is seen on the island’s southern edge., Google Earth Shemya sits on Russia’s back doorstep. , Google Earth In the intervening post-Cold War years, beyond Cobra Dane radar, listening post, and weather station operations, Shemya was probably best known as an emergency landing strip for stricken airliners and military aircraft flying the northern routes than as a strategic fastness. That is all rapidly changing in the new era of so-called ‘great power competition.’ The cold truth is that Shemya would likely play a major role during any conflict in the Pacific, even beyond its strategic monitoring duties. With this in mind, the potential threats to the remote windswept island and its sensitive infrastructure are numerous. On the high-end, cruise and ballistic missiles would be a major factor, but on the lower-end, the threat of enemy commandos trying to take the outpost intact would also be palpable. As such, special operators assigned to Special Operations Command North (SOCNORTH), including Army Green Berets from the 10th Special Forces Group, deployed to Shemya for the exercise, training to defend the island alongside on-site security forces, which resulted in some pretty fascinating images. These include images of dive teams wading ashore, roving patrols in MRZR buggies , and even the deployment of FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) to counter lower-tier aerial threats: NORAD NORAD NORAD NORAD NORAD NORAD NORAD A video, also posted by NORAD on Twitter, shows a C-130 making crosswind landing at Shemya and releasing MRZRs loaded with special operators: During a major crisis where the island is under direct threat, more advanced air defenses would be needed to protect it, but that is just one facet of such a plan, as is the deployment of special operators to helo counter a possible enemy raiding force. Noble Defender isn’t just occurring at Shemya, it is ongoing all over Alaska, with NORAD’s core air defense mission being the focus. This includes Canadian CF-18 working alongside F-22s in support of various air defense training scenarios, including countering the rising threat of cruise missiles. While the F-22’s AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar is quite capable of detecting these low signature, low-flying targets, Canada’s CF-18s, with their AN/APG-73 mechanically scanned array radars are less so. But that will be changing soon as Canada is set to upgrade a number of its aging Legacy Hornets with new AN/APG-79V4 AESA radars. The exercise on Shemya is just another sign of a rapidly increasing readiness and overall defensive posture around the Pacific as the U.S. grapples with a more aggressive China and less predictable Russia. With this in mind, we are likely to see more exercises that focus on fortifying critical and potentially vulnerable locations like Shemya, as well as enhancing their standing defenses, in the very near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 18, 2021",China’s Claim That Its Fractional Orbital Bombardment System Was A Spaceplane Test Doesn’t Add Up (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chinese government has denied a recent report that the country tested a strategic weapon system that involves launching a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicle into orbit before it re-enters the atmosphere to make its final flight toward its target. The country’s foreign ministry claimed that the test in question was of a reusable spaceplane , not a weapon. However, that official statement referred to a spaceplane launch in July, while the original report from the Financial Times newspaper said that the orbital bombardment system was tested in August, as you can read more about here . Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian first issued this denial at a press conference on Oct. 18, 2021. He gave his remarks in response to questions from reporters for Bloomberg and AFP . “As we understand, this was a routine test of [a] space vehicle to verify technology of spacecraft’s reusability,” Zhao said, according to an official transcript. “After separating from the space vehicle before its return, the supporting devices will burn up when it’s falling in the atmosphere and the debris will fall into the high seas.” “As I just said, it’s not [a] missile, but a space vehicle,” Zhao continued when asked specifically if the spacecraft he was referring to was the vehicle described in the Financial Times article . Bloomberg ‘s James Mayger and the BBC ‘s Stephen McDonell both subsequently reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had further confirmed to them that Zhao was talking about a spaceplane test in July. As already noted, the orbital bombardment system test reportedly took place in August. China’s state-run China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, or CASC, did publicly announce what it said was a successful reusable spaceplane test in July, but it described that flight as sub-orbital. CASC did not say how this spaceplane had taken flight but did say that the test had been carried out from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China’s Inner Mongolia region. In 2020, there had been another test from Jiuquan that saw a Long March 2F carrier rocket boost what was only referred to as a “ reusable experimental spacecraft .” An artist’s conception of a CASC commercial spaceplane., HAN PENGXIN / CHINA ACADEMY OF LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY The Financial Times reported that a Long March 2C carrier rocket had been used in the orbital bombardment test and that this launch, the 77th involving this variant of the Long March family , had not been publicly disclosed. The 76th Long March launch took place on July 19, while the 78th occurred on Aug. 24, according to that newspaper. The CASC spaceplane test that Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao was apparently referring to took place on July 16. Furthermore, the Financial Times ‘ sources said that the weapon completed a full profile flight including an impact that reportedly missed the intended target area by dozens of miles. CASC said the spaceplane successfully landed at an airport after its flight. It also does not seem likely that the U.S. Intelligence Community would have confused these two events if they had each occurred as reported. Regardless, experts and observers have now raised questions about where there may be some degree of overlap in Chinese reusable spaceplane projects and this reported orbital bombardment system. This would hardly be the first instance of an ostensibly civilian or commercial aerospace project in China having links to the country’s military and potentially being a dual-use research and development effort. At the same time, China has openly fielded and continues to develop actual hypersonic glide vehicle weapons. “Is this China’s response to the US insisting the X-37B is in no way a weapon?” Brian Weeden, the Director of Program Planning at the Secure World Foundation, wrote on Twitter, as being among a number of significant questions that remain unanswered about this reported Chinese test. There are long-standing but totally unsubstantiated rumors that the X-37B miniature space shuttle , which the U.S. Space Force now operates , could have some sort of orbital bombardment role . “Is every spaceplane now a FOBS?” Weeden added, referring to a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System. Of course, the basic concept of a FOBS dates back to the Soviet Union in the 1960s. In principle, compared to a more traditional intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the semi-orbital nature of a FOBS system effectively eliminates any range limitations and makes it difficult, if not impossible for an opponent to determine what the intended target or targets might be. In addition, the FOBS’ lower trajectory of flight makes it more difficult for high-angle, ground-based early-warning radars to detect it in the first place, presenting additional challenges for the enemy. Using a hypersonic glider of some kind as the warhead-carrying portion of a FOBS adds a new dimension of unpredictability to the weapon. The glider would provide a highly maneuverable platform to bring the warhead to the target, giving it much more significant capabilities to either dodge enemy air and missile defenses or simply strike from an unexpected vector where there are no defenses. A strike by way of the South Pole would, for example, come from the exact opposite direction from where much of the U.S. missile defense shield is pointed . Any attempt to intercept a hypersonic glide vehicle, in general — even under the most optimal conditions — is something the U.S. government and others have publicly acknowledged is an extremely difficult proposition . So, whether or not this reported Chinese FOBS program is related to any spaceplane projects or not, the immense defense-busting capability that a FOBS system utilizing a hypersonic glide vehicle has the potential to offer, combined with the U.S. government’s efforts to improve and expand its ballistic missile defenses, would seem to be the most immediate reason for the Chinese to even explore this weapon. It is also worth noting that the regime in Beijing did have a FOBS in development in the 1960s and 1970s, known as the Dongfeng-6 (DF-6), but this project was ultimately canceled, reportedly due to technical issues. The Chinese aerospace and missile industries are significantly more capable of pursuing these kinds of high-technology efforts now than they were 50 years ago. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said as much when he publicly asserted , seemingly out of nowhere, that the Chinese military was working on a FOBS-like weapon at the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference in September. “If you use that kind of an approach, you don’t have to use a traditional ICBM trajectory. It’s a way to avoid defenses and missile warning systems,” he said. As the Financial Times reported initially, U.S. Air Force General Glen VanHerck, head of both U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), had said at a separate conference in August that the Chinese had “recently demonstrated very advanced hypersonic glide vehicle capabilities” that present “significant challenges to my NORAD capability to provide threat warning and attack assessment.” The U.S. military has observed “dog-leg maneuvers just right off the bat, maneuvering in space, what I call range-extensions,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill told members of Congress back in June, before the reported Chinese test, in reference to advanced ballistic-missile performance capabilities in development around the world. “They’re all hypersonic when they come back into the atmosphere.” A Chinese FOBS program, which appears to be in a very early stage of development and far from being an operational reality, would also be well in line with the rest of the country’s apparent strategic buildup, which includes what appears to be a dramatic expansion of its silo-based ICBM force , as well as the development of new air-launched capabilities and a growing fleet of nuclear ballistic-missile submarines . The U.S. government has repeatedly said in recent years that its intelligence shows that the Chinese are working to significantly enlarge their overall stockpile of nuclear warheads, as well. The regime in Beijing has historically been and continues to be, at best, limited when it comes to transparency around its strategic capabilities and the policies that go with them. Drew Thompson, a former U.S. Department of Defense official with experience working on China issues, Tweeted out yesterday that Chinese officials may be increasingly more flexible about the nature of the country’s so-called “no first-use” policy” that ostensibly prohibits using nuclear weapons in response to non-nuclear threats. Though technical developments such as the FOBS appear to be driven in no small part by a desire to respond to American missile defenses, the rest of this buildup is likely a product of a wider array of factors. It is especially important to point out that present and planned U.S. ballistic missile defenses cannot feasibly defeat a full-scale strike from China’s existing nuclear arsenal. U.S.-Chinese relations have been increasingly cold for years now over a number of issues, including territorial and trade disputes. American criticism of the Chinese government’s handling of the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic , its crackdowns on the Uyghur ethnic minority in its far-western Xinjiang province and on pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong, and its increasingly threatening rhetoric and actions toward Taiwan, have all further fueled this deterioration in ties, while generating more support for hardline policies in Beijing. U.S., Chinese , and Taiwanese officials have increasingly spoken about fears of the inevitability of some kind of open conflict in the region. “US missile defense remains the primary technical-level concern for China’s nuclear establishment” but “US efforts such as to strengthen ties with Taiwan and point fingers on China over Xinjiang might play a more direct role than US missile defense in fueling China’s accelerated nuclear modernization,” Tong Zhao, a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy’s Nuclear Policy Program, wrote on Twitter as part of a longer discussion of possible Chinese strategi motivations. With all this in mind, the U.S. government has expressed interest in negotiating new arms control deals with its Chinese counterparts, including possible tripartite agreements that would also include Russia . The Chinese, for their part, have rebuffed these overtures so far. All told, a Chinese FOBS program, combined with a general lack of transparency regarding other strategic weapon developments, only adds further uncertainty to this already highly charged geopolitical environment. Updated 5:45 PM EST: NPR ‘s Geoff Brumfiel has added some interesting data points to the discussion surrounding this reported orbital bombardment system test. The Financial Times reported that the Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, or CALT, announced what it said were the 77th and 79th launches of Long March 2C carrier rockets, but that it did not issue any statement regarding the 78th launch. Brumfiel notes that CALT also did not announce the 76th Long March 2C launch, but that one does appear in a separate public database that CASC maintains of all launches involving any variant of the Long March family. Interestingly, CASC’s database does not show any gap that would align with the apparently missing 78th Long March 2C launch in CALT accounting. Brumfiel also noted that CASC declining to say what rocket was used to launch the spaceplane in the July test only adds another layer of potential confusion. The discrepancies between the CASC and CALT accounting of total launches only raise more questions about the timeline of both the reported suborbital spaceplane and orbital bombardment system tests.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 18, 2021",China Tested A Fractional Orbital Bombardment System That Uses A Hypersonic Glide Vehicle: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A report from Financial Times’ Demetri Sevastopulo and Kathrin Hille states that China has tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicle that goes into space and traverses the globe in an orbital-like fashion before making its run through the atmosphere toward its target. There would be huge implications if such a system were to be operationalized, and according to this story, which says it talked to five officials confirming the test, the U.S. government was caught totally off-guard by it. The trial flight is said to have occurred around August, with the boost-glide vehicle being lifted into space by a Long March 2C rocket. The launch of the rocket, the 77th of its kind, was undisclosed by Beijing, while the 76th and 78th were—the latter of which occurred in late August. The Financial Times says that the tested hypersonic glide vehicle missed its target by a couple of dozen miles, but that is hardly reassuring considering the capabilities that are apparently in development here. The foundation of this Cold War-era concept is commonly referred to as a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or FOBS, but instead of carrying a traditional nuclear-armed reentry vehicle, this Chinese system would carry a hypersonic glide vehicle that would possess immense kinetic energy upon reentry. As such, it could make a very long maneuvering flight through the atmosphere at very high speeds to its target. The FOBS concept has long been a concern because of its potential to bypass not just missile defenses, but even many early warning capabilities. Compared to a traditional intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a FOBS can execute the same strikes but from highly unpredictable vectors. Range limitations also become a non-factor and the timing of an inbound strike is also far less predictable. But at least with a traditional FOBS ballistic missile system, some sort of projections could be made if the mid-course “orbital” vehicle can be tracked, although that could still be a real challenge. That is not the case at all with a hybrid design like the one being claimed to have been tested here, which would be totally unpredictable. A Long March 2C rocket lifts off on a mission., Chinese Space Agency The maneuvering hypersonic glide vehicle, descending from high-altitude at extreme speed, could travel thousands of miles to its target, which can be totally offset from a normal ballistic track. Complicating things more, these systems can attack from the south pole, not just the north where most of America’s ballistic missile early warning, tracking, and defensive apparatus is focused. Intercepting such a system would also be very challenging, especially considering U.S. mid-course intercept capabilities are focused on traditional ballistic missile flight profiles, which fly more of a parabolic trajectory and have generally known ranges of each stage of flight. With a glide vehicle end-game delivery system paired with a FOBS, its vehicles can enter the atmosphere beyond the range of an interceptor’s exo-atmospheric mid-course kill envelope, with the glide vehicle weaving its way through the atmosphere to its final target. Traditional surface-based radar systems’ line of sight is also significantly reduced as the hypersonic glide vehicle travels in the atmosphere. Paired with the extreme speeds involved, this can make these systems nearly useless at providing any details regarding the impending attack. Hypersonic glide vehicles themselves are also very tough to kill with no real defense against them available at this time. Elaborate defensive concepts are in the works , but their effectiveness will depend on just how fast these vehicles are traveling, their maneuverability, density in numbers, what third-party sensors are available to help in generating an engagement solution, and more. A hypersonic glide vehicle with the kinetic energy in its favor from an orbital-like delivery would likely be the very hardest to kill. As we have repeatedly noted , the Financial Times also recognized the eyebrow-raising comments by U.S. Department of Defense officials recently on potential “non-traditional” delivery systems that could bypass America’s strategic defenses: Last month, Frank Kendall, US air force secretary, hinted that Beijing was developing a new weapon. He said China had made huge advances, including the “potential for global strikes . . . from space”. He declined to provide details, but suggested that China was developing something akin to the “Fractional Orbital Bombardment System” that the USSR deployed for part of the Cold War, before abandoning it.“ If you use that kind of an approach, you don’t have to use a traditional ICBM trajectory. It’s a way to avoid defenses and missile warning systems,” said Kendall. In August, General Glen VanHerck, head of North American Aerospace Defense Command, told a conference that China had “recently demonstrated very advanced hypersonic glide vehicle capabilities”. He warned that the Chinese capability would “provide significant challenges to my Norad capability to provide threat warning and attack assessment”. There is no shortage of concerns about China’s nuclear buildup within the DoD , and like Moscow , it’s only logical that Beijing would invest in delivery systems that circumvent U.S. early warning and defensive capabilities. The idea that at least some of the hundreds of supposed silos out in the Chinese desert being built to house new ballistic missiles could one day be armed with a weapon like this is very concerning. It also could be yet another major driver behind the Pentagon’s push to deploy a whole new space-based early warning and tracking system for hypersonic and ballistic missiles, including one capable of “cold layer” tracking of missiles in their midcourse stage of flight. That layer would be absolutely essential in trying to defend against a FOBS, that is if a defense at all is actually feasible or even strategically sound. We are not talking about a rogue state here with a few advanced ballistic missiles. China would be able to deploy dozens or even hundreds of these at once. At a certain point, kinetic defenses against such a capability become a losing proposition and a very costly one at that. Still, this was an early test aboard a full-on rocket used for traditional space access missions. It will take China some time to perfect such a system and package it in a quickly deployable militarized configuration. Major thermal and ablative issues also must be overcome, among others, but it’s not like China hasn’t been working diligently in the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle realm for many years . Regardless, if this report ends up being fully accurate, one thing is likely: New calls for hugely expensive missile defense capabilities will be ringing loud and often on Capitol Hill, as well as demands to do whatever possible to bring China to the bargaining table in hopes of obtaining some type of strategic arms limitation treaty. We will continue to update this story as more emerges, but for now, make sure you read the Financial Times’ excellent original report here.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 8, 2019",Feel The Speed In These Incredible Photos From The Air Force’s Rocket Sled Track,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force recently highlighted some fascinating pictures showing various tests that have been conducted using the High Speed Test Track at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico over the past seven decades or so. This test track had gained additional relevance in recent years amid a resurgence of interest across the U.S. military in hypersonic weapons and other air vehicles, and the Air Force is now looking at ways to modernize the system to ensure it can continue to support those efforts. The 846th Test Squadron currently oversees the operation and sustainment of the Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT). The 846th is what is known as a geographically separated unit and is assigned to the 704th Test Group, which is situated within the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) at Arnold Air Force Base in Tennessee. The HHSTT is used to see how a variety of test articles, including those related to weapon systems, such as bunker-buster bombs , as well as ejection seats and various other kinds of components for aircraft and other aerospace vehicles, work at extremely high speeds or otherwise respond to the stresses of moving at those very high velocities. That latter category of testing includes, among other things, seeing how rain impacts payloads traveling at high speed. A picture from one such “rain erosion” test is seen at the top of this story. A high-speed photograph of a penetrating warhead test article zipping down the HHSTT., USAF The test track dates back to 1949, when work first began on the original section, which was 3,400 feet long. Actual testing using the system began the following year. A test that took place on Dec. 10, 1954, is by far the most famous of the work done at the track in the 1950s. On that date, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel John Stapp was strapped into a metal chair on a rocket-powered sled, dubbed Sonic Wind No. 1, and blasted down the track. The sled hit 630 miles per hour and Stapp was subjected to 40 Gs of force during the ride, leaving him with broken ribs and a detached retina among other injuries. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel John Stapp, in the white helmet at center, is strapped into a chair on the Sonic Wind No. 1 rocket sled ahead of the fateful test on Dec. 10, 1954., USAF “Stapp survived and, in the process, demonstrated the incredible forces the human body is capable of withstanding, thereby providing a greater understanding of human tolerance to high-speed aircraft ejections,” according to the Air Force. “Stapp’s work also aided in the development of safety belts capable of tolerating a greater amount of force.” He also broke the land speed record at the time, earning the title of “Fastest Man on Earth.” Since Lieutenant Colonel Stapp became the “Fastest Man on Earth,” testing related to aircraft ejection systems has continued to be a major part of the work done using the HHSTT., USAF USAF USAF The Air Force continued to utilize the track, and expand its capabilities, in the following decades. In 1982, another rocket sled, with a 25-pound payload instead of a person, set a new land speed record for an uncrewed platform. The unspecified test article hit a peak speed of 6,119 miles per hour. For comparison, the current land speed record for a vehicle with a person in it, set by Andy Green in 1997 using a jet-powered “car” called ThrustSSC, sits at just over 763 miles per hour. The HHSTT’s land speed record stood until 2003, a year after the completion of the fifth and most recent extension of the track, when Air Force testers launched a rocket sled with an unknown 192-pound test article that reached a speed of 9,465 feet per second, or 6,500 miles per hour. At the altitude at which the test track sits this is around Mach 8.5. For reference, hypersonic speeds are generally defined as anything above Mach 5. Another test article gets launched down the HHSTT., USAF USAF USAF USAF A high-speed picture showing submunitions being released from a US Army weapon system at supersonic speed during a test using the HHSTT., USAF That record has since been broken, too, with a test that the Air Force said hit Mach 8.6, seen in the video below, which you can find out more about here . https://youtube.com/watch?v=mXp6zL-cyac At present, the HHSTT is 50,971 feet, or around 10 miles, long. However, its ability to conduct certain tests is limited by the fact that only a wide-gauge track runs the full length. A parallel set of narrow-gauge rails only run for around four miles of the track’s total length. The wide-gauge portion of the system is “mainly used for egress, dispense, and guidance testing,” according to the Air Force. What is described as a “guidance and navigation test article” prior to a test using the HHSTT., USAF “Currently, recovered high-speed – those of Mach 3 or more – and rain erosion tests are limited to one of the 10-mile-long rails in a monorail configuration,” according to an official Air Force news item published earlier this month. “The monorail configuration limits the size of test articles to small, light test articles, or coupons, due to roll stability issues at high velocities.” A view of the current 10-mile-long HHSTT., USAF The 846th is currently looking into three different courses of action, details of which the Air Force has not yet released. However, each one is centered on the main goal of extending the narrow gauge rails to run the full 10-mile-length of the track. A prototype penetrating warhead breaks through a concrete wall during impact testing utilizing the HHSTT., USAF When actual work to modernize the HHSTT might begin, how much it might cost, and how the Air Force might pay for the upgrades are all uncertain. “The 846 TS [Test Squadron] is currently pursuing military construction funding, but there is a chance of receiving funding through other agencies, such as TRMC [the Pentagon’s Test Resource Management Center ],” the Air Force’s official news story explained. “Because the 35 percent architecture and engineering, or A&E, design is not yet completed, a preferred COA [course of action] has not yet been chosen at this time. U.S. Air Force policy and Congress require the completion of a 35 percent A&E design before the project is funded to help avoid cost overruns due to inadequate planning.” As already noted, the plethora of hypersonic aerospace projects that are publicly ongoing across the U.S. military , with many more almost certainly taking place in the classified realm, only underscores the importance of specialized high-speed test facilities like the HHSTT. “The Holloman High Speed Test Track is a truly unique national asset with a 70-plus year history that is worthy of preservation and modernization to continue its test and evaluation heraldry into the next century,” Lee Powell, the 846th’s Capability Development Element Chief, said an interview for the recent Air Force piece on the modernization plans. The pictures that the Air Force showcased recently certainly highlight the unique and often record-breaking work that has already been done at the track at Holloman over the past 72 years. It now looks set to become an even more important part of the service’s testing ecosystem in the years to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was a scene right out of a sci-fi thriller: a broad beam of green light emanating from an aircraft overhead scanning across the ground in the darkness. Videos like the one below have been shared on social media, showing the eerie and — for many — outright puzzling scene along the Southern California coast. I think N300WQ was doing bathymetric LIDAR scans along the coast of Los Angeles last night. A couple nights before someone took this video of it doing the same thing in San Diego. https://t.co/SoeqFL6Peq pic.twitter.com/uT5GErzU7L — John Wiseman (@lemonodor) October 11, 2021 The flight left people perplexed, but what was happening is entirely explainable. The aircraft in question was equipped with an advanced lidar system operated by Woolpert , an engineering consulting firm, in support of the National Coastal Mapping Program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Referred to as a bathymetric scan, the purpose of flights like this is to map coastal waters in high resolution. Lidar, short for “light detection and ranging,” uses lasers to precisely measure distances from a receiver. Though the uncanny experience of being scanned from above may be unnerving, the lasers are safe for eyes given the altitude of the plane and the brevity of the exposure. Twitter users also shared video of what the scanning process looks like from the air. Here you can see the large circular pattern of the lidar scan as it passes over the terrain: Here's what the LIDAR looks like from the plane's point of view. (From this video that @engelsjk found: https://t.co/pJZx8dgqrX ) pic.twitter.com/FjQhcYMvgm — John Wiseman (@lemonodor) October 12, 2021 Residents of California’s coasts may be noticing the flights for some time. The mapping process, while highly precise, requires extensive airtime. A 2015 survey in California required more than 1,000 flight lines flown over 90 days, according to a piece written for Lidar Magazine by Jennifer Wozencraft, a research scientist with the USACE. Observers in the area of the current survey will likely notice Woolpert’s King Air 300 Turboprop making repeated passes as part of the data collection process. Some of the flights are being conducted at night to avoid interfering with the region’s heavy air traffic. Flight Path of N300WQ , FlightAware According to a Reddit commentator associated with the program, the specific instrument on board is the Teledyne Optech CZMIL bathymetric system. The sophisticated sensor can reliably capture data down to depths of about 165 feet and can detect objects like sunken vessels or other navigation hazards. It is used to record data in a roughly mile-wide zone where storm surges, waves, and currents create the greatest environmental change and impact on coastal communities. The National Coastal Mapping Program was established in 2004 and is tasked with mapping coastlines every five years. The data supports work of various kinds done by USACE, as well as the U.S. Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NMOC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Accurate coastal data plays an important role in managing flood risks, ecosystem restoration, and maritime navigation. By repeating the process every five years, the survey also produces highly valuable comparative data to manage climate or storm-related changes. The data is released to the public and academics via NOAA’s Digital Coast website. One important and ongoing application of the National Coastal Mapping Program is to manage something called shoaling, or the process of sediment deposition in navigation channels. As sand and other materials accumulate, it can create dangerous areas that require dredging. Bathymetry helps track these changes and manage waterways. Measuring Channel Shoaling Via Lidar , Airborne Laser Hydrography II In recent years, lidar systems have become more accessible and cheaper to operate. Here you can see an example of another mapping system and the kind of high-resolution 3D data it can produce. Systems like these can increasingly be mounted on small planes and even fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, as seen in the video below. In the meantime, if you’re on the California coast and find yourself being scanned, don’t worry, you aren’t about to be beamed up. It is just the National Coastal Mapping Program capturing the data that helps monitor climate risks while keeping waterways safe.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Apr 28, 2022",Air Force Wants Hundreds More Jet Trainers Despite Already Buying T-7 Red Hawks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking to add at least 100, and possibly hundreds more, Advanced Tactical Trainers on top of the 351 T-7A Red Hawks that it’s already ordered under the T-X program . The additional aircraft might also be Red Hawks, but the service has said it will look at any potential contenders that fit its requirement. The Request for Information (RFI) for the Advanced Tactical Trainer was released by the Air Force on October 12, as part of a wider effort to revamp Air Force fighter training. However, the new jets would likely not only be used for schooling pilots, but also as aggressor aircraft as an extension to the Adversary Air program , and as “tactical surrogates,” allowing more operational-level training to be transferred from costly fighters onto a cheaper platform. A prototype T-7A Red Hawk., Boeing/Eric Shindelbower The latest details of the planned Advanced Tactical Trainer procurement confirm that the jet trainers are intended to support the Reforge initiative, an entirely new training concept that Air Combat Command (ACC) revealed last year, which you can read much more about here . “The platform desired is one that will meet the Initial Tactical Training platform requirements within the Reforge [concept of operations],” an ACC spokesperson told Air Force Magazine . The idea behind the tactical surrogate is to have a lower-cost training platform equipped with a cockpit that’s representative of an advanced frontline fighter jet, such as the F-35. It’s driven by the fact that the current T-7A program of record, covering 351 aircraft, is judged insufficient to meet all future jet training needs as envisaged under Reforge. The Advanced Tactical Trainer would likely emerge with a very different set of capabilities compared to the T-7A’s. The Air Force is eyeing external hardpoints for the carriage of training weapons, electronic warfare pods, air combat maneuvering instrumentation pods, and fuel tanks. A compact radar might be another option for the jet, and the RFI also specifically mentions that consideration is being given to installing an infrared search and track (IRST) sensor. Mirage F1s operated by the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. These jets are part of an expanding contractor-operated aggressor fleet that could, in the future, be supplemented or superseded by a new Advanced Tactical Trainer., U.S. Air Force/Brad Sturk The Air Force hasn’t yet laid out a timeline for acquiring the additional jet trainers, nor has it yet established how many aircraft would be required. However, the RFI outlined a need for 100 new Advanced Tactical Trainers, with the potential for this to grow via subsequent lots of 50 aircraft. In its initial reporting , Air Force Magazine said the Air Force may end up buying 400 Advanced Tactical Trainers, although this had been reduced to 200 in its follow-up story . More details of numbers and timeline are expected once the Air Force has received responses to the RFI. As for the position of the T-7A with regard to the Advanced Tactical Trainer program, the Air Force has made clear it is “not limiting the aperture to any one platform,” and the ACC spokesperson told Air Force Magazine the service will consider “any and all vendors that can meet the desired design.” A digitally manipulated rendering of a T-7A in U.S. Air Force colors., Saab That said, Boeing and Saab, who co-developed the T-7A, have previously suggested that the platform would lend itself to adaption for an aggressor role, something The War Zone has discussed in more detail in the past. Furthermore, the same airframe could lend itself well to the operational training tasks of the kind that would be flown by a tactical surrogate type. ACC has even discussed the possibility of a more fighter-jet-representative derivative of the Red Hawk, unofficially referred to as the F/T-7X . Deliveries of the basic T-7A were scheduled to begin in 2023, with the Red Hawk planned to reach initial operational capability with Air Education and Training Command the following year. There have, however, been some problems with the program, including a “wing rock” issue that Boeing recently reported was resolved with a software fix, plus production delays due to COVID-19-related parts shortages. As a result, the Milestone C full-rate production decision for the T-7 has now been postponed to fiscal year 2023. The T-50A that Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries unsuccessfully offered for the T-X program has also previously been earmarked as a potential candidate to at least evaluate elements of the Reforge concept. In the past, the Air Force has looked at leasing between four and eight T-50s under what is known as the RFX program, a proof-of-concept experiment supporting Reforge. It’s not clear if the current RFI has led to a revision of this idea. The Lockheed Martin/Korea Aerospace Industries T-50A., Lockheed Martin Unlike the T-7A, the T-50 currently exists in a production-presentative form, meaning it would be available for a Reforge demonstration almost immediately if required. The same goes for the Leonardo M-346 , which was also pitched for both T-X, as you can read about here , and for RFX. Either way, although ACC had said last year it would finalize the lease deal, so far this has not happened, leaving the status of RFX unclear. While the selection of the T-7A for the T-X requirement in late 2018 represented the most significant development in Air Force training for many years, Reforge could potentially be even more far-reaching. The Reforge concept was unveiled in early 2019 by U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, the boss of ACC, who called for the modernization of a training enterprise that was still based on principles essentially developed to support the demands of World War II. Gen. Mike Holmes, commander of Air Combat Command, arrives at Beale Air Force Base in 2020 to discuss training priorities with the resident 9th Reconnaissance Wing., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Colville McFee “Pilot training in the 1930s lasted 12 months — and, despite the proliferation of GPS, glass cockpits, autopilots, and digitally aided flight controls — it still lasts 12 months today,” Holmes wrote in a piece for War On The Rocks . Currently, a future fighter pilot undergoes a three-phase Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) process, starting actual flying in the second phase, using the T-6A Texan II turboprop trainer. The third phase, also known as lead-in flight training (LIFT), currently involves more time on the T-6A before transitioning to the T-38 Talon jet trainer, which will be replaced the T-7A. T-38 Talons from the 25th Flying Training Squadron at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma., U.S. Air Force At this point, pilots now move on to the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) course, run by a Formal Training Unit (FTU) and providing the experience of the particular frontline fighter jet they are destined to fly. Holmes’ Reforge plan would radically overhaul this fairly complex process, with future fighter pilots heading straight to their future operational fighter squadron after completing the first two phases of UPT. Once at their frontline unit they would continue to fly the T-7A (or the new Advanced Tactical Trainer type) before transitioning to their assigned combat aircraft at the same location. The hope is that the revised system will speed up the process of getting newly trained pilots into frontline cockpits, with fewer moves between different bases. Simplified training systems should also help make the fighter pilot career more attractive, at a time when the Air Force is experiencing a significant aircrew shortfall . At the same time, the training demands currently placed on frontline fighters would be reduced. At the same time, having schoolhouse units with advanced training jets co-located at operational fighter bases would potentially allow the trainers to undertake aggressor missions, too. All these types of missions would be supported by the same kinds of synthetic training aids, including simulators, that are already in the works for the T-7. What’s more, having a new Advanced Tactical Trainer available could help increase the number of actual flight hours that fledgling aviators receive. In recent months, there have been concerns that a reduction in flying hours coupled with an increasing reliance on simulators has led to a surge in mishaps. “Students receive less total flight experience in their initial flight screening, in UPT, and IFF, with increased emphasis on virtual training and efficiency on the horizon,” one USAF fighter pilot told The War Zone last year. “While FTUs and undergraduate training programs can get student pilots up to par for a few flights in each phase [enough for them to progress along the timeline], the lack of experience is beginning to show in basic flight discipline.” With all this in mind, it becomes clearer where the proposed Advanced Tactical Trainer would fit. While the T-7A, initially at least, is being procured as a direct replacement for the T-38 and is tailored for the LIFT portion of the syllabus, the Advanced Tactical Trainer would feature more ‘operational’ capabilities, making it a more appropriate stepping-stone to a frontline type. Potentially it would also be suitable for continuation training, too, reducing the demand on costly fifth-generation types, which are extremely expensive to fly and maintain. Having advanced trainers embedded with these units would help reduce costs and save airframe hours with everything from basic tactics training to pilot proficiency. This is a particular concern for those units that currently fly T-38s to help pilots of advanced stealth fighters, as well the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber and U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane, to maintain basic flight proficiency and build flight hours. A 71st Fighter Training Squadron T-38 Talon pilot boards an aircraft at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, before flying an air combat experience mission against an F-22 Raptor., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Tristan Biese Were the Air Force to acquire as many as 200 Advanced Tactical Trainers, it could potentially also fulfill a significant portion of its red air requirement. The Air Force has hired seven different contractors to provide red air support at bases across the country, but, with the discussion about red air capacity still ongoing, this could eventually be supplemented or even superseded by in-house aggressors. Currently, the Air Force has a small cadre of just two aggressor squadrons , plus T-38s already providing aggressor roles for the F-22s of the 1st Fighter Wing. Ultimately, it’s possible the Advanced Tactical Trainers could be switched between schoolhouse and aggressor missions as required, providing another saving in terms of resources. Long-term, they may also well end up being used in conjunction with new unmanned red air platforms , an area of interest that is fast gaining traction . An F-22 from the 95th Fighter Squadron flies in formation with a 2nd Fighter Training Squadron T-38 as they return to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, following a training mission in 2017. Talons provide the Raptors with air-to-air threat replication in support of combat and formal training., U.S. Air Force/Master Sergeant Burt Traynor It should also be remembered that the Air Force is in the process of completing a study regarding the optimum mix of its tactical fleets, in general, a subject we have also discussed in the past . Reforge is set to play heavily into this, since it aims to rearrange how pilots train before getting to units and how those squadrons continue to do certain kinds of training after they arrive. That means the importance of the Advanced Tactical Trainer will likely be felt across the entire Air Force fighter enterprise. So, while it’s not exactly clear when we might see a new Advanced Tactical Trainer (or a reworked T-7) on an Air Force ramp, it is clear there is a growing demand for such an aircraft to fulfill a variety of roles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 15, 2020",Robot Dogs Now Have Assault Rifles Mounted On Their Backs (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ghost Robotics and SWORD International have teamed up to create a rifle-toting “robot dog.” Called the Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle, or SPUR, the system adds a 6.5mm Creedmoor rifle from SWORD to one of Ghost Robotics’ quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicles , or Q-UGVs. The SPUR made its debut on the show floor at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual convention in Washington, D.C., which opened yesterday. Though Ghost Robotics is partnered with a number of other companies to explore defense and security applications, among others, for its Q-UGVs — which you can read more about in this past War Zone feature — this appears to be the first example of one of these unmanned systems with an actual weapon mounted on it. Unarmed examples of the Q-UGV are notably already in limited use with the U.S. Air Force’s 325th Security Forces Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and are being tested by other units within that service. The exact configuration of the 6.5mm gun inside the SPUR module — how much ammunition it contains, and how hard it might be to reload — are all unclear. A product card for SPUR that emerged during the AUSA show can be instructed remotely to chamber the first round from an unloaded state, as well as clear the chamber and safe the gun. In terms of the weapon itself, SWORD does offer derivatives of the 5.56x45mm AR-15/M16 family , as well as similar, but larger caliber guns, more akin to the Armalite AR-10 or Knights Armament Company SR-25 . Those rifles come in calibers such as 7.62x51mm , 6.5mm Creedmoor, .300 Norma Magnum, .338 Lapua Magnum , and .338 Norma Magnum . The weapon used in the SPUR module looks like it could have a sound suppressor fitted to the front end, which could make it more difficult for opponents to determine where the shooting might be coming from. A SWORD International MK-17 Mod 1 Gungnir rifle, which is chambered in 6.5mm Creedmoor. , SWORD International The 6.5mm Creedmoor is not currently in any kind of widespread use by the military or other security forces, either in the United States or elsewhere around the world. However, U.S. Special Operations Command is notably in the process of acquiring light machine guns and rifles in this caliber , ostensibly to fill an intermediate niche in overall performance between existing 5.56x45mm and 7.62x51mm guns, as you can read more about here . Testing has shown that this 6.5mm round actually offers increased range over the various 7.62x51mm cartridges that are available to the U.S. special operations community now. There is limited information about the SPUR available now, but The War Zone has already reached out to Ghost Robotics for more details. The SPUR product card said it is capable of precision fire out to 1,200 meters, or nearly 3,940 feet. This unmanned system already features impressive stabilization capabilities simply as a result of its quadrupedal design. “When our robots move around and you shove them, these forces are computed at 2,000 calculations per second per leg,” Ghost Robotics CEO and founder Jiren Parikh told The War Zone ‘s Brett Tingley in an interview last year, adding that the system is designed in such a way as to work to ensure it can keep functioning even if various onboard sensors it can use to help move around fail. “We’re adjusting it to make it like a mammal. Our robot, when you see it climbing stairs or walking or running around, we turn off all the sensors,” he continued. “It’s just feeling. It’s completely blind. The reason we do that is because if a warfighter or a mining company, if anybody is using our robot, this robot had better operate 99.99% of the time.” As for targeting, the SPUR module appears to have its own sighting system on top. In past testing the U.S. Air Force has conducted using unarmed Q-UGVs, operators have utilized the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK), an app that can be installed on tablet-like devices, to interact with these unmanned systems and view the feeds from their onboard video cameras. It seems likely that ATAK or a similar piece of software could be used to enable a human to aim at targets and engage with them with the robot’s 6.5mm rifle. The Air Force has also discussed potentially operating Q-UGVs remotely from centralized command facilities via virtual reality headsets . A member of the US Air Force interacts with a Ghost Robotics Q-UGV using a tablet-like controller during a demonstration at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida., USAF Though neither Ghost Robotics nor SWORD have said such capabilities are in the works now, SPUR could also have some degree of additional autonomy, in the future, potentially employing artificial intelligence-driven capabilities to at least detect and “lock on” to potential threats, even if an operator ultimately has to give the approval to start shooting. Sighting systems for small arms that offer these kinds of capabilities are available on the open market now. Regardless, giving the Q-UGV a weapon of its own offers a way for it to immediately prosecute any targets it might come across, if desired. This could be especially valuable given the idea that these “robot dogs,” just like their real counterparts , will be able to get into tight spaces that present significant risks for their human “handlers,” or just be hard for a person to access all. A 6.5mm Creedmoor gun would give it the option of engaging threats at more extended ranges, as well. This could be highly advantageous for perimeter security tasks, which is already one of its key missions, at least in expeditionary scenarios, as well as for scouting and urban warfare military operations. “These dogs will be an extra set of eyes and ears while computing large amounts of data at strategic locations throughout Tyndall Air Force Base,” Air Force Major Jordan Criss, the head of the 325th Security Forces Squadron, said in a statement after a test involving the Q-UGVs last year. “They will be a huge enhancement for our defenders and allow flexibility in the posting and response of our personnel.” The option now of arming the Q-UGVs adds a new tier of capability to these unmanned systems that could increase their flexibility when employed in various roles. At the same time, the idea of arming quadrupedal unmanned systems, which already prompt very different kinds of reactions compared to more traditional unmanned ground vehicles, may sit unfavorably with some. Those types of responses may well increase just as Ghost Robotics’ product line, including unarmed types, becomes increasingly more autonomous. The video in the Tweet below shows unmanned systems from Boston Dynamics, not Ghost Robotics, but illustrates a general reaction many have to quadrupedal designs, in general. Boston Dynamics has a standing policy not to allow the weaponization of its unmanned systems. At the same time, small armed unmanned ground systems are hardly new , and the military utility of adding weapon systems to quadrupedal designs is obvious. Update: Ghost Robotics has now followed up with The War Zone about SPUR and has clarified that it did not provide the product card regarding the system’s capabilities that had emerged during the AUSA show this week. In addition, Ghost Robotics has stressed that, in its present form, with regards to employing the weapon, SPUR is entirely operator-controlled and does not have any autonomous capabilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 8, 2022",New Tracked Unmanned Vehicle Bristles With A Whopping 50 Switchblade Suicide Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Dynamics Land Systems’ showcased a mockup of its TRX tracked unmanned ground vehicle configured as a unique mobile launch platform for 50 AeroVironment Switchblade loitering munitions, commonly referred to as “suicide drones,” earlier this week. This followed news that the Army now plans to test versions of the TRX, which stands for Tracked Robot 10-Ton, alongside Howe & Howe Technologies’ Ripsaw M5 unmanned mini-tank and Pratt Miller and QinetiQ’s Expeditionary Modular Autonomous Vehicle during an experimental exercise next year. The loitering munition-armed TRX concept was on display at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual conference in Washington, D.C., which opened on Oct. 11 and wrapped up yesterday. General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) had first unveiled TRX at the AUSA gathering last year. This builds off the company’s formal partnership with AeroVironment, which it first announced in 2018 . A TRX tracked unmanned ground vehicle configured to launch dozens of AeroVironment Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions. This version of the design also has a tethered quadcopter-type drone., GDLS The TRX on display at AUSA this year has two banks of 13 launch tubes for Switchblade 600 drones, as well as two other arrays, each with 12 tubes capable of launching smaller Switchblade 300s. It also has a tethered quadcopter-type unmanned aerial vehicle that is stowed internally when not in use. @GD_LandSystems Tracked Robot 10-ton (TRX) vehicle is featuring integrated AeroVironment Switchblade Loitering Missiles Systems at #AUSA2021 . Stop by their booth (6027) and learn how this integration extends the RSTA and precision strike lethality range of tactical ground units. pic.twitter.com/lKo2bhNtid — AeroVironment (@aerovironment) October 11, 2021 This configuration presents a significant combination of reconnaissance and surveillance, as well as organic strike capabilities, in a relatively small and mobile package that can be used in very high-risk environments. What makes loitering munitions such as the Switchblades different from more traditional drones and missiles is that they can scout ahead and otherwise search for potential targets of interest and then initiate strikes on them directly, if desired. AeroVironment’s Switchblade family, like many loitering munitions , have an operator-in-the-loop control arrangement, where the user “sees” what the drone does via the feeds from the electro-optical and infrared cameras in its nose through the course of its flight. While the drones can be directed to fly to specific locations and automatically track designated targets, or even hit selected coordinates, the operator can also make fine adjustments to their course manually. This increases the accuracy of the system and also offers an added margin of safety, offering the user the option of aborting a strike should circumstances change, such as innocent bystanders suddenly appearing in the target area. AeroVironment has talked about improving the autonomous capabilities in the future, including potentially enabling groups of them to work cooperatively together as a networked swarm. You can read more about the Switchblade family, as well as the company’s other projects, in this past War Zone feature . https://youtube.com/watch?v=EBNayBINEBc The exact purpose of the tethered drone in this particular TRX configuration is unclear, but it could provide a signal relay to allow it to operate well forward of its operators. This could be especially useful to help extend the reach of the datalink to its loitering munitions, or even ensure connectivity is possible at all in urban and high terrain. Fitting this tethered unmanned aerial system with a set of video sensors would also allow it to conduct localized surveillance around the vehicle, as well. If it could be untethered, it could help search for potential targets, especially those hiding behind cover. The complete package could give even relatively small units a tremendous amount of organic precision firepower against threats at extended ranges, including those not within direct line of sight. It would give those same forces significantly increased battlefield awareness, as well. The fact that it is unmanned means it can operate forward of friendly troops in extremely dangerous areas, as well. As already noted, this is just one possible configuration of TRX, which GLDS offers as a modular platform that can be readily reconfigured to meet customer requirements. GDLS had notably previously shown a less-involved loitering munition launch platform concept with three eight-cell launchers for Switchblade 600s and two six-cell launchers for Switchblade 300s on a simple flat deck, as seen in the video below. “TRX features innovative thinking, ranging from its AI [artifical intelligence]-enhanced design to advanced, lightweight materials and a hybrid-electric propulsion system,” according to GDLS’ website. “TRX is positioned to provide superior performance as an enabling technology in a myriad of critical battlefield roles, including direct and indirect fire, autonomous resupply, complex obstacle breaching, counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), electronic warfare (EW), reconnaissance, and other battlefield missions.” The core design is derived from the company’s submission to the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) competition, which had sought a 10- to 20-ton unmanned vehicle and that Howe & Howe ultimately won with the M5. That earlier vehicle, known as GD-TL-1 , featured the same RT40 turret from Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg, which features a 30mm XM813 automatic cannon and a coaxially-mounted 7.62x51mm M240 machine gun , and was previously known as the MCT30, as the M5. As already noted, it uses a hybrid-electric propulsion system, which is often touted as offering improved fuel economy compared to similarly-sized designs with more conventional internal combustion engines, as well as being quieter at lower speeds. GDLS has also shown versions of this unmanned vehicle with lightweight metallic and rubber-band-type tracks. The latter types of tracks offer certain advantages in performance, maintenance, and logistics over traditional metallic tracks. GDLS has said in the past that TRX has the speed necessary to keep pace with existing Army wheeled and tracked armored vehicles, such as the Stryker and Bradley families. A TRX chassis with lightweight metallic link tracks., GDLS TRX is semi-autonomous, with it being able to follow various general instructions from a human operator, such as following waypoints and otherwise navigating by itself to a selected destination. A user would similarly be able to able to interact with any payloads it might be carrying, such as sensor systems or weapons, remotely. Its large, flat top deck can also just be used to carry cargo around the battlefield. Despite the TRX losing the initial RCV-M competition, the Army presently plans to test four of these unmanned systems as part of a larger experiment at Fort Hood, Texas, next year. It is unclear how they will be configured for that exercise, but GDLS did demonstrate one in a cargo-carrying configuration during this year’s iteration of the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment at Fort Benning, Georgia. A cargo-carrying TRX unmanned ground vehicle takes part in the 2021 Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment. , GDLS The RCV-M is one of three tiers of unmanned ground vehicles the Army is looking to acquire in the coming years for use in various roles. Pratt Miller and QinetiQ’s Expeditionary Modular Autonomous Vehicle, which will also take part in the Fort Hood exercise next year, won the initial competition for a prototype RCV-Light design weighing under 10 tons. The service has yet to begin looking for possible RCV-Heavy types, which it expects will be between 20 and 30 tons and be more akin to an unmanned light tank. An Army briefing slide outlining its three planned tiers of Robotic Combat Vehicles (RCV) and their expected sizes and capabilities., US Army There has also been an expectation that the Army will open a new competition to acquire a fleet of RCV-Ms for actual operational use after it concludes its initial testing of designs in this class, such as the Ripsaw and the TRX. GDLS had already continued to develop its design on its own with an eye toward competing for that future contract, as well as offering the platform to any other interested customers. GDLS also appears to be working to leverage lessons learned with regard to the TRX’s development and production, as well as the general design philosophy behind it, for other projects. At this year’s AUSA conference, the company also displayed a larger, modular unmanned armored vehicle concept that looks more like a light tank, called the Katalyst Next Generation Electronic Architecture (NGEA). This “new, modular open architecture features scalable and modular hardware and software for Next Generation Capabilities. It significantly improves warfighter effectiveness via enhanced mobility (obstacle avoidance, path planning); lethality (object detection, object identification/recognition, automated target prioritization); and survivability/reconnaissance (360-degree situational awareness, see-through armor, terrain analysis),” according to a GDLS press release . The “Katalyst NGEA also provides core capabilities such as computing, sensor fusion and processing, and power management and distribution. It provides unparalleled performance and size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) to support evolving needs.” The Katalyst concept vehicle, at right, alongside the TRX configured as the launch platform for Switchblade loitering munitions, at the 2021 AUSA conference., GDLS All told, TRX, as well as Katalyst, only underscores the increasing interest in unmanned vehicles and loitering munitions within the U.S. military as a whole. TRX is already set to join the Army’s burgeoning unmanned test fleet, and it will be very interesting to see what configuration or configurations — maybe including the loitering munition-packed one we saw this week — the service will test out next year.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 17, 2021",The Army Just Tested Its New Ballistic Missiles That Takes Aim At Previously Prohibited Ranges (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has announced the latest test of its Precision Strike Missile , or PrSM, for the U.S. Army, though the company has not said exactly how far the weapon flew. The distance appears to be close to, if not over, a previous range limitation for ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles that the United States had adhered to until 2019 under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , with Russia. The PrSM test was conducted on Oct. 13, 2021, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California using an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) truck-mounted launcher. The missile flew out into the Pacific Ocean. This test had originally been expected to take place in August but was pushed back because of scheduling conflicts . A Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) during an earlier test launch., Lockheed Martin “The Precision Strike Missile continues to validate range and performance requirements,” Paula Hartley, Vice President of Tactical Missiles at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, said in a statement. “Achieving this long-range milestone for the baseline missile demonstrates PrSM’s capability to meet our customer’s modernization priorities on a rapid timeline.” In terms of the distance of the flight, Lockheed Martin has only said that it was the “longest flight to date” and that it succeeded in “exceeding [the] maximum threshold” for the PrSM as set by the Army. An earlier test of this missile in May saw it fly approximately 400 kilometers , or around 248.5 miles, and official documents say the Army’s current plan is for PrSM’s to be able to hit targets beyond that range. There were reports earlier this week that the expectation was that the missile would travel at least 499 kilometers, or around 310 miles, in this new test flight. Alerts to airmen and mariners detailing airspace restrictions related to the impending test, which had been issued last month, do show a potential impact area that looks to stretch out to between 400 and 500 kilometers from Vandenberg. That 499-kilometer distance is significant, as the old INF treaty had prohibited the United States and Russia from deploying ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. That agreement collapsed in 2019 after the U.S. government pulled out unilaterally, ostensibly over Russia’s deployment of a banned ground-launched cruise missile system. The Army, which had started the PrSM program before that point, subsequently changed its range requirements for the missile after the elimination of these range restrictions. The growing range of weapons like PrSM can only be a factor in the Army’s new use of Vandenberg for these kinds of tests, something that officials in California only approved in July . The Army’s main overland missile test facility, the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, is simply not big enough to handle tests out to these kinds of distances. At the same time, unfortunately, the U.S. government also has limited options for overwater testing of missiles out to much greater distances, as evidenced by the scheduling issues at Vandenberg that led to the delay in this PrSM test. In addition, test launches into the Pacific are inherently easier for potential American adversaries, particularly China , to observe and try to gather information about the weapon in question. “If I’m an adversary, I’m looking forward to the notifications to mariners and aircraft of when you’re doing that test so I can park [an] AGI [an intelligence-gathering ship ] and every one of my spacecraft right there to watch you test that so I can glean as much MASINT [ measurement and signature intelligence ] information as possible,” retired Air Force Major General Jon Norman, who is now Vice President of Customer Requirements & Capabilities, Raytheon Missiles and Defense, had said during a talk at the Air Force Association’s 2021 Air, Space, and Cyber conference last month, speaking primarily about the testing of advanced hypersonic weapons. Norman and his fellow panelists made mention of possibly increasing the use of the Australian government’s test range at Woomera and similar potential cooperation with Canada to help mitigate these operational security issues. A test rocket launch at Woomera in 2013 as part of the US-Australian Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation program., NASA PrSM, which is primarily intended to replace the Army’s existing Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile, is the lower end of a three-tier future missile force the service is planning to field in the next few years. The middle tier role will be filled by Typhon, also described as a “Mid-Range Capability” system, which will be capable of firing ground-launched examples of the U.S. Navy’s SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles , as you can read more about here . The Dark Eagle Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), which you can find out more about here , will form the upper end of these missile capabilities. The Army views these missiles, collectively, as critical to its ability to fight and win future high-end conflicts against near-peer adversaries, such as China or Russia. The Army plans to employ PrSM from both HIMARS and tracked M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launchers, which are already capable of firing ATACMS missiles, as well as 227mm artillery rockets, including guided types. The service is also exploring the possibility of fielding an unmanned launch vehicle derived from HIMARS, seen in the video below, which could also shoot PrSMs in addition to other weapons. Lockheed Martin is already planning to conduct another PrSM test launch later this year, as part of the Army’s Project Convergence 21 exercise, which will feature various new weapon systems and other technologies the service is in the process of developing. The company is also expecting another contract award from the Army before the year is out, which will fund the development of a moving-target capability for PrSM. There has been talk in the past specifically about the potential use of these missiles in an anti-ship role . The ability for PrSM to engage ships could be particularly valuable in the context of a future conflict in the Pacific, potentially against China , where operations in and around the maritime domain would be a core focus. The ever-extending range of these missiles that Lockheed Martin has been able to demonstrate will only give them added flexibility in that region and elsewhere. If nothing else, this latest test of the PrSM makes clear the Army, along with the U.S. military, as a whole, is well on its way to obtaining a mixture of new, longer-range missiles that only a few years ago it had been prohibited from fielding under the INF. Updated 3:45 PM EST: Lockheed Martin has confirmed to The War Zone that the Army’s “maximum threshold” range for PrSM is 400 kilometers and that yesterday’s test flight exceeded that distance. The company could not provide any other details about the range demonstrated in this latest test. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Substantial details have emerged about the crash of a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter close to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on May 15 last year, our original coverage of which you can find here . As well as the loss of one of the precious Raptors, the incident also saw a near-miss involving more F-22s and F-35s, some of which almost collided immediately after the crash. In addition, the accident report describes how the Raptor pilot experienced a catalog of problems with the jet from soon after takeoff until he was finally forced to eject and the aircraft spiraled into the ground. We knew already that the root cause of the crash was a maintenance error after the F-22 had been washed, which affected its control inputs. Otherwise, the Air Force remained tight-lipped about the accident and declined to run a more expansive investigation, citing operational security concerns. Now, more information is available, thanks to documents released to Air Force Times through the Freedom of Information Act and written about here by Rachel S. Cohen. An Air Force photo of the wreckage of the F-22 that crashed on May 15, 2020, that was obtained by the Air Force Times via the Freedom of Information Act., U.S. Air Force Flown by the 43rd Fighter Squadron’s assistant operations director, the F-22 departed Eglin Air Force Base using the callsign Hornet 1. It was supposed to take part in training as part of a group of three F-22s, six F-35s, and four F-16Cs. But the Raptor’s pilot saw the first sign of trouble as soon as the jet took off when a cockpit warning light began flashing. There were no other obvious problems, so he pressed on, but at a height of only around 50 feet, the jet began an uncommanded roll to the left. At this point the pilot feared a possible flame-out in the left engine, so throttled back both the Raptor’s Pratt & Whitney F119 turbofans and leveled out, while his wingman checked over the engine for any obvious problems. With the F-22 now in a 45-degree climb, the pilot was presented with a second warning light, this time indicating degraded air data. Another roll to the left and a pitch-down followed, leaving the jet “almost inverted,” according to his wingman. “I thought that I was out of control at that point and was concerned that I might have to eject right there,” the pilot told the investigators. Again, however, the pilot regained control and decided to continue with the exercise. A capture from an Air Force video showing the pilot battling to keep control of the F-22 not far from Eglin Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force At this point, yet another warning light appeared, telling the pilot the airframe was becoming overstressed by g-forces and he made the call to return to Eglin, burning off fuel on the way. “As I passed 10,000 feet, the jet began to have uncontrollable tendencies again … a barrel-roll type feel,” the pilot said. “It took a majority of the pressure I had available in my right arm to keep the airplane in level flight, and then at that point, I could no longer turn left.” While battling with the controls, the pilot looked over the cockpit display, which seemed to be showing incorrect altitude and speed values, compared to what his wingman was reporting. At this point, the decision was made to eject, and the Raptor spiraled to the ground, ending up in a fireball on the Eglin Training Range. After the F-22 pilot had floated down to safety under his parachute, F-35s from the same training mission headed to the scene with the aim of relaying the coordinates to rescuers, remaining in the area to oversee the recovery. In fact, the pilot was picked up by a passing government vehicle and then taken to a local hospital where they received treatment for minor injuries. F-22s from the 94th Fighter Squadron, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, and F-35As from the 58th Fighter Squadron, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, fly in formation after completing an integration training mission over the Eglin Training Range, Florida, in 2014. , U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Shane A. Cuomo The day then almost got a whole lot worse for the Air Force. The F-35s coordinating the rescue began to run low on fuel and left, but almost collided with F-22s in airspace that the documents describe as “saturated and … fairly dangerous.” Exactly how many jets were involved in this near-miss is unclear, although the jets would have been part of the two F-22s and six F-35s that were still airborne over the range at the time. Added to the mix were Air Force U-28A Draco intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft from Hurlburt Field in Florida. Air Force fighter jets performing in a local flyover had also been expected to be in the area before their route was changed . The accident report described the near-miss as “a learning opportunity for future emergency response coordination in the area,” according to Air Force Times . Clearly, the incident could have been a lot worse, in what was already a sorry month for Eglin, where an F-35A crashed upon landing just four days later, on May 19, 2020, the pilot ejecting after struggling with an extraordinary catalog of problems with the jet. As it was, those two accidents led to a “safety pause” on flying operations at the base. A 325th Fighter Wing F-22 taxis at Eglin Air Force., U.S. Air Force/Samuel King Jr. In the event, the Raptor mishap resulted in more than $202 million in damage, including environmental cleanup costs. The root cause of the accident was a maintenance error made after the aircraft was washed , the indication being that a procedure already in place was improperly followed by one or more ground crew. This error “impacted control inputs transmitted to the aircraft,” according to the Air Force, but no further details have been provided, and it’s unclear if changes have been made in maintenance procedure, or remedial work carried out on any other aircraft. All in all, the Air Force’s public response to the incident has been somewhat bizarre, including the original decision to waive the requirement to conduct a traditional accident investigation, which would then be released publicly. The decision is more unusual since this was a Class A mishap, a category involving incidents causing more than $2.5 million in damage or in which a person is killed or permanently fully disabled. The loss of any Raptor, however, is a big deal for the Air Force, even if the service is beginning to look to its eventual replacement . Before the May 2020 crash, the Air Force had 186 Raptors total, of which just around 125 were assigned to combat-coded units. An F-22 from Tyndall Air Force Base taxis on the flight line at Lask Air Base, Poland, in 2015, during a routine deployment to Europe., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Joe W. McFadden In March of this year, an F-22 suffered a nose gear failure at Eglin, the pilot landing the jet after suffering an unspecified in-flight emergency, an incident you can read about here . The small fleet enjoys a “silver bullet” status within the service but has faced other challenges as well as attrition. On the flight line, the F-22 has suffered from mission-capable rates that are notoriously low , something The War Zone has explored in-depth, generally hovering somewhere below 50 percent overall. When Hurricane Michael hit Florida in October 2018, a number of the jets, along with supporting units , were forced to leave their home base of Tyndall Air Force Base and move to Eglin. The clean-up effort after Hurricane Michael made a direct hit on Tyndall Air Force Base, and 55 of its resident F-22 Raptors., U.S. Air Force The 43rd Fighter Squadron, which serves as the designated F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU), remains at Eglin, although its long-term home could be Joint Base Langley-Eustis , in Virginia. According to Air Force Times , 43rd Fighter Squadron’s parent 325th Fighter Wing has “struggled with staffing and morale in the years since the hurricane as airmen feel stuck in limbo between Tyndall and a potential move to Joint Base Langley-Eustis.” While there is no evidence pointing to this situation having influenced the May 2020 Raptor crash, the incident does reinforce just how vulnerable the small, but ever-important F-22 fleet is to any kind of attrition, as well as how an apparently minor maintenance incident can have dramatic consequences.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 4, 2021",Army Halts Widely-Hyped Multi-Billion Dollar Advanced Augmented Reality Goggle Program (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has paused the acquisition of advanced augmented reality headsets for its troops, a program it had heavily publicized in recent years. This revelation comes less than a year after the service announced it had awarded Microsoft a contract potentially worth close to $22 billion to produce tens of thousands of these Integrated Visual Augmentation Systems (IVAS) in the coming years. Jane’s was first to report on this major development in the IVAS program after learning about it on the sidelines of the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual conference in Washington, D.C., yesterday. That outlet said that Brigadier General William Glaser, head of the Synthetic Training Environment Cross-Functional Team at Army Futures Command, had disclosed this effective halt to the IVAS program, which other Army officials subsequently confirmed. A US Army soldier wearing an IVAS headset aims their M4 carbine during an exercise., US Army The order to stop work reportedly came from the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, which is now “essentially doing a reset of that program, figuring out what is the appropriate timeline and the where is the technology,” Glaser told Jane’s . Exactly what issue or issues led to this pause is unclear at present. The War Zone has already reached out to the Army’s Program Executive Office Soldier (PEO Soldier), which is managing the IVAS program, for more information. Glaser’s comments to Jane’s do indicate that there have been some questions about the maturity of at least some portions of the technology behind IVAS. Derived from Microsoft’s commercial HoloLens augmented reality system, these headsets provide night vision and thermal-imaging capabilities. However, it is IVAS’ augmented reality functions that were expected to be truly revolutionary for soldiers, as you can read more about in detail here . The headsets can provide a wealth of information to individual troops, such as waypoints and other navigation symbology, much in the same way helmet-mounted displays do for pilots flying many types of modern combat aircraft. In addition, the networked systems can pipe in video feeds and other sensor data from various offboard sources. Different sensor feeds could then be fused together to provide a higher fidelity view of the battlespace. Soldiers in a single unit would be able to share what they see directly with each other, as well as with other individuals further afield. Artificial intelligence-driven software might also be able to help automatically detect and identify potential threats. Prototype versions of IVAS reportedly already had some facial recognition capability . The IVAS headsets were also set to provide valuable training capabilities, including the ability to help simulate a diverse array of threats virtually during live exercises. This, in turn, would give even relatively small facilities the option to conduct more realistic and expansive drills without any additional resources. An Army M240 machine gun team wearing IVAS headsets during an exercise., US Army However, early prototype IVAS systems were simply not rugged enough for operational use, with one iteration notably unable to work in the rain . The Army has conducted more rigorous testing of the latest version, with what it had indicated were positive results. Soldiers have also experimented with using IVAS headsets within vehicles and during airmobile operations . Questions have also been raised about the conformal batteries that soldiers need to carry in their gear to power the IVAS headsets, both in regard to how long they can keep the systems running and safety concerns about what might happen if they get shot or otherwise damaged in combat. The Army has said in the past that it has made progress on improving the capabilities of the batteries and their resistance to incoming fire. A conformal battery the Army was testing circa 2013. Improved conformal batteries are necessary to power the IVAS headsets., U.S. Army It is certainly possible that, despite progress in these areas, the Army has still determined that IVAS is not actually ready for widespread fielding just yet. At the same time, the problems that at least temporarily have led the service to halt the project may also be completely unrelated to any of these previously known issues. It is also worth pointing that employees at Microsoft have protested the company’s development of a version of HoloLens for the U.S. military in the past. However, there is no indication, one way or another, that this has been a factor in the recent pause in the IVAS program. In addition, it’s interesting to note that the Army is already fielding Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars (ENVG-B), which it says offer advanced night vision, thermal imaging, and networked sensor fusion capabilities. The service has also indicated in the past that it wants to add more robust augmented reality features to the ENVG-B. You can read more about those goggles here . https://youtube.com/watch?v=Poi0bOi91X8 Whatever the Army’s reasons for halting the IVAS program might be, and whether it gets back on track, the decision is certainly not good news for the immediate future of a program the service had been touting as potentially game-changing for individual soldiers. Updated 10/14/2021: The Army’s PEO Soldier has pushed back against the characterization of what has happened to the IVAS program as being a “halt” or “pause” and has released the following statement: The Army decided to shift the IVAS Operational Test and fielding to a date later in FY22. The Army is fully committed to its partnership with Microsoft to advance specific technologies to meet operational requirements and maximize warfighter impact. The Army conducted an Adversarial Electronic Warfare and Cybersecurity Test in September 2021, and plans to execute testing regularly throughout FY22. This decision allows the Army and Industry team to continue to enhance the IVAS technology platform ensuring Soldiers achieve overmatch in Multi Domain Operations. The Army intends to continue developing and fielding this revolutionary, first-of-its-kind technology in FY22. PEO Soldier also released a bullet point list of significant developments in the IVAS program since October 2020, as well expected milestones through the planned formal fielding of the first examples of the system to an operational unit in September 2022, which is as follows: • OCT / NOV 2020: Soldier Touchpoint 3 (STP 3) & Distinguished Visitor Days • DEC 2020: Rapid Fielding Decision • JAN 2021: Vehicle Integration VE2 – Stryker & Bradley • FEB 2021: Cold Weather Test • MAR 2021: Production Award • MAR 2021: Tropical Weather Test • APR 2021: Soldier Touchpoint 4 (STP 4) • JUL 2021: OT Entrance Criteria User Jury • SEP 2021: Vehicle Integration VE3 – Bradley • SEP 2021: Adversarial Electronic Warfare & Cybersecurity Test • MAY 2022: Operational Test (IOT) • SEP 2022: First Unit Equipped (FUE) Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Procurement"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 2, 2021",Ex-Air Force Tech Boss Eviscerates Pentagon For Already Losing The AI Race Against China (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nicolas Chaillan, who served as the first Air Force Chief Software Officer, has slammed the Pentagon for its failure to keep pace with its rival China, after stepping down from his post last month, in what was, at least in part, a protest against the conditions that led to this perceived outcome. Among various complaints leveled at the U.S. military’s approach to modernization, Chaillan highlights what he sees as a lost battle between the United States and China in the field of cyber capabilities, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, or AI. In an interview given to the Financial Times , Chaillan details some of the reasons behind his departure and the failings that he thinks have left China in pole position in terms of these kinds of high-end military technologies. Chaillan had previously announced his resignation from the U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force via an open letter posted on his LinkedIn profile on September 2, which warned that the Pentagon was systemically “setting up critical infrastructure to fail” on a grand level while also criticizing the lack of support he’d received from leadership even on basic IT matters. People’s Liberation Army fighter pilots are now battling AI-driven virtual opponents as part of their training, reflecting the growing importance of artificial intelligence to the Chinese military., PLA “We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years,” Chaillan told the FT . “Right now, it’s already a done deal; it is already over in my opinion.” This echoes Chaillan’s sentiments in his LinkedIn letter, in which he identified China’s “drastic advantage of population over the U.S.” and its “booming, hardworking population” that left the United States with no chance of competing unless it became “smarter, more efficient, and forward-leaning through agility, rapid prototyping and innovation.” A former technology entrepreneur, software developer, cyber expert, and inventor, Chaillan was appointed to his Air Force position under Dr. William Roper, the former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. Roper himself left the service earlier this year, leaving a legacy of cutting-edge programs and disruptive concepts in his wake. While in his Air Force job, Chaillan was the service’s senior software czar, tasked with “analyzing current software and cloud migration plans to avoid vendor lock-ins while allowing for rapid prototyping and a streamlined process for deployment,” as well as looking for “new commercially available off-the-shelf software and cloud-related technologies to help with their adoption across various Air Force programs.” The inability of the U.S. military-industrial complex, and policymakers, to enable this adaptation was among the reasons that Chaillan departed his Pentagon post after three years. In his parting shot, the LinkedIn open letter, Chaillan laid the blame squarely on the Pentagon’s policy of installing inexperienced personnel in top IT security jobs: Please stop putting a Major or Lt Col. (despite their devotion, exceptional attitude, and culture) in charge of ICAM, Zero Trust or Cloud for 1 to 4 million users when they have no previous experience in that field — we are setting up critical infrastructure to fail. We would not put a pilot in the cockpit without extensive flight training; why would we expect someone with no IT experience to be close to successful? They do not know what to execute on or what to prioritize which leads to endless risk reduction efforts and diluted focus. IT is a highly skilled and trained job; Staff it as such. While he clearly felt he was personally well equipped to deliver on the kind of transformational changes the Pentagon desperately needs, it became impossible under the long-established DoD bureaucratic framework and culture: I told my leadership that I could have fixed Enterprise IT in 6 months if empowered. Yet with my 22 years of expertise running IT innovation, I was underutilized and poorly leveraged by the DOD, as most of my time was wasted trying to convince folks to engage with me and consider more relevant and efficient solutions, while I watched as they continued to deliver capabilities that do not meet the basic needs of our warfighters. This, in particular, is a damning indictment of the gulf between what the Pentagon says it wants in terms of forward-looking software and cyber capabilities, and how it actually goes about trying to put those into action. “The DoD should stop pretending they want industry folks to come and help if they are not going to let them do the work,” Chaillan contended, in the process raising the question of why Will Roper left his position, too. According to the FT, there could be more to come from Chaillan, who told the newspaper he has plans to testify to Congress about the Chinese cyber threat “over the coming weeks.” As it stands, Chaillan contends, China has taken a lead in emerging technologies, while the United States has been unduly focused on expensive, monolithic programs like the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , all part of a defense budget that still far outstrips that of China, although the latter continues to grow . The F-35 may be the biggest program in Pentagon history, but critics may argue that the Department of Defense has neglected to focus on broader AI capabilities, as well as cyber resilience., U.S. Air Force/Christopher Okula While analysts predict the rivalry between the United States and China could ultimately lead to some kind of military confrontation, and this thinking is influential on U.S. military planning and posture , Chaillan said that a war between the two powers was not the issue. Indeed, he expects Beijing to be dominant across geopolitics regardless of potential conflicts. Of particular concern to Chaillan is America’s resilience to cyber warfare, the kind of gray zone threat that is of increasing importance as a military tool in both China and Russia . Describing some U.S. government cyber defenses as being at “kindergarten level,” Chaillan also noted that Google’s unwillingness to work on behalf of the Pentagon was a major hindrance to U.S. cyberdefense capacity and in stark contrast to the way that Chinese companies work for their government, with little in the way of ethical concerns. Moral questions over the role of AI represent another hurdle slowing down U.S. progress in this field, he added, without apparently providing a solution to that problem. After all, Beijing operates a totalitarian regime full of state-run enterprises that work directly with the military, unrestricted by many of the ethical considerations that concern the U.S. government and private enterprise. Nevertheless, Chaillan’s conclusions broadly echo the findings of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, or NSCAI, an extensive report published earlier this year that The War Zone discussed at the time . Among its conclusions was the fact that the current lead enjoyed by the United States over China with regard to AI is quickly being eroded. The wide variety of AI forms, tools, and applications, as presented in a graphic from the NSCAI report., NSCAI “The Chinese have made the judgment that the way they will supplant the United States as the dominant global power is to pursue technology and become the world’s technological engine, which will then empower both their economy as well as their military,” said Robert O. Work, vice-chair of the NSCAI, in April this year . In his critique of the Pentagon, Chaillan’s words also recall those of the then- boss of U.S. Strategic Command , General John Hyten, who in the past has also sought to bring attention to the sluggish pace of change inherent in the U.S. military. “I’m very concerned that our nation has lost the ability to go fast,” Hyten told the Air Force Association back in 2017. “And we have adversaries now, and we see proof in those adversaries that they’re going faster than we are. … Slow, expensive, that’s the way it is. …  I’m criticizing the entire process … the entire process is broken.” Outside the United States, too, there is growing recognition of the fact that who leads in AI will also be guaranteed a head-start on the geopolitical stage. Back in 2017, for example, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that “Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” The picture painted by Chaillan, meanwhile, is of a technologically innovative China pushing ahead, unhindered by bureaucracy or regulations, while the U.S. Department of Defense stagnates amid spiraling procurement costs and mismanagement. So far, however, U.S. officials have generally remained adamant that AI is introduced incrementally, taking care to ensure that it’s used in a more responsible way. Speaking recently , Lieutenant General Michael S. Groen, the director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC, said that body was “fielding [AI] through slow, incremental progress,” with the aim of establishing reliable products that can be used across different combatant commands. Lieutenant General Michael S. Groen, the JAIC director, provides a briefing on the use of artificial intelligence for military purposes: It seems Chaillan hoped that his role as Chief Software Officer for the flying branch would have been expansive and that he would have been able to use his experience in the civilian tech sector to introduce change more quickly. But that didn’t happen, he said, and instead, he was bogged down in tasks such as “fixing basic cloud things and laptops.” Recognition that China is making significant strides in AI clearly stretches all the way to the top of the Pentagon. In July, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III pointed to Beijing’s plans to use AI for “a range of missions — from surveillance to cyberattacks to autonomous weapons.” “China’s leaders have made clear they intend to be globally dominant in AI by the year 2030,” Austin added, before noting that the United States had set itself the same target, albeit with the caveat that it was “not going to cut corners on safety, security, or ethics.” Reflecting that ambition, Austin pointed to “more than 600 efforts underway to enhance the nation’s defense using artificial intelligence.” There has also been some progress in this field under Chaillan’s tenure, and his resignation letter highlighted how AI and machine learning capabilities are slowly migrating “to the jets to co-pilot the jets alongside our Air Force pilots.” The letter also pointed to his contribution to the Joint All Domain Command and Control, or JADC2, initiative , which aims to connect sensors and other information pathways across all services, while observing that the failure to deliver on this top-priority program was another reason for his departure. Nicolas Chaillan, center, then the Department of the Air Force chief software officer, poses for a group photo with Major General Michael Schmidt, right, program executive officer for Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, and Networks, during a visit to Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, in June., U.S. Air Force/Lauren Russell Chaillan’s experience seems to reinforce the idea that while the Pentagon has a growing interest in AI and autonomous weapons, it remains wedded to the vision that AI is simply another tool that helps reduce the workload for its personnel and may help speed up and simplify a host of processes. China, on the other hand, seems much more willing to go “all in” when it comes to increasing autonomy and AI-driven defense technologies. Ultimately, however, both China and the United States — and any other nation or non-state entity concerned with AI — needs to address similar technical questions. As we have discussed in the past , these include how to insert a machine capable of autonomous decision-making into the process, the kinds of tasks can it handle and what degree of responsiveness and accuracy it can provide. Then there is the question of what kinds of vulnerabilities are introduced to the wider system once AI is inserted. Although it might be falling far short of the targets that Chaillan would like to see, AI is already having an impact on how the U.S. military goes about its business. Examples include the pioneering test last December when AI-driven algorithms controlled sensor and navigation systems aboard a U.S. Air Force U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane . That was the first time that AI has been “safely” put in charge of any U.S. military system, according to the Air Force. A U-2 Dragon Lady equipped with open software architecture at Beale Air Force Base, California, in September 2020., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Luis A. Ruiz-Vazquez The Air Force has also been looking at bringing AI into the air-to-air dogfighting arena, with simulated tests pitting AI-controlled F-16 fighter jets working as a team against an opponent, just one effort that’s exploring how AI and machine learning may help automate various aspects of air-to-air combat. The Air Force is also pushing ahead with its Skyborg program , which is developing a suite of AI-driven systems that it hopes will be able to operate “loyal wingman” type drones working in concert with manned platforms, as well as other drones. An initial version of the Skyborg “computer brain” was flight-tested for the first time earlier this year. China, for its part, seems to be active in many of the same areas, including providing AI-driven opponents in simulated dogfights for its own air forces. This is just part of the People’s Liberation Army’s growing interest and investment in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, generally. This also now appears to extend into the maritime domain, with reports that China has been developing underwater drones able to autonomously identify and attack hostile submarines. While we don’t know exactly how AI will influence or change the way the United States — or China, for that matter — fights wars in the future, it’s clear that the opportunities it presents are potentially enormous. That’s an outlook shared by many military leaders. The difference, however, is in how best to adopt and exploit AI’s potential. The Pentagon at large has, until now, espoused a step-by-step approach, but there have been many alarm bells ringing that the institution is just too slow to adapt to today’s tactical realities, especially when it comes to absolutely critical cyber-related issues. It’s possible that Chaillan’s parting shots might at least encourage some change in this regard, especially if he does indeed sit in front of key members of Congress and paints as bleak a picture as he has to the public already. Stay tuned for our upcoming feature that looks at the truths and myths surrounding artificial intelligence and its intersection with warfighting. We believe it is the clearest look yet at the realities surrounding this highly complex but essential topic. Update, October 14: Nicolas Chaillan has sought to distance himself from some of the more pessimistic comments attributed to him, while also engaging in a war of words on LinkedIn with Raj Iyer, the Army Chief Information Officer. Speaking to Breaking Defense , Iyer countered Chaillan’s analysis, stating it was “absolutely not true” that China has taken a lead in military AI. Beijing’s cyber units, he added, were “operating in a vacuum, and they’re relying on nefarious methods and cyberattacks to be able to get to, you know, what they think they know that we have.” In response, Chaillan described Iyer as an “incompetent” leader and declared “him the perfect example of the problems I am describing of our Department of Defense. Since his arrival, he has stopped tremendous partnerships with the Air Force on Cloud One and pushed his teams to build his own siloed Army Cloud and his own DevSecOps stack despite DoD Platform One being light years ahead. His ego led to more waste of taxpayer money than I’ve seen before.” Chaillan also criticized Iyer for apparently encouraging competition between the Army and Air Force, again on LinkedIn, some months previously. Chaillan hit back: “How about we wake up and realize we must be One Team One Fight and compete against China instead?” On the topic of China’s relative military AI status compared to the United States, Chaillan dialed back on some of his earlier quotes, declaring: “I never said we lost the AI war. I said we will if we don’t wake up and please, Raj, stop lying to our citizens by pretending Army systems have AI capabilities baked-in from the get-go. This is a joke and anyone in DoD knows this.” Chaillan then signed off: “It is certainly not with leaders like [Raj Iyer] that we will solve this issue as he still denies we even have a problem. Disgraceful. He must resign.” Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Forces U.S. Air Force"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 20, 2021",Watch This B-1B Make A Crazy Steep Banking Climb After A Touch And Go At RAF Fairford,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. B-1B “Bone” bombers are currently forward deployed to RAF Fairford in England as part of Bomber Task Force-Europe, which sees B-1s , B-52s , and B-2s rotate into the theater fairly regularly for operations with NATO and other allies and to ‘deter’ Russia. For instance, just a couple of days ago , a pair of the B-1Bs flew from RAF Fairford to Lithuania to train with forward air controllers on the ground there, before making an unprecedented stop at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany to refuel and then heading back to RAF Fairford . Today the big swing-wing bombers headed out on more local missions and upon returning from one of these sorties, a Bone executed a touch and go followed by a touch of afterburner and the execution of an incredible banking climb—almost a wing-over—before landing. As you can see in the video below, the whole sequence was downright triumphant (turn your audio on!): The video comes to us from our friend Saint1 ( @Saint1Mil on Twitter ), who shared some details about the unique experience with us: DARK flight of two B-1s left Fairford this morning and flew a local loop up to Scotland and returned to Fairford. One of the two aircraft then hot pitted [refueled without shutting down its engines] and went out again as DARK33 around mid-day, again on a local loop (probably the same)… DARK33 then returned late in the afternoon and did an over-the-top left-hand break, then a touch and go with the tight turn and then landed. Note that he hit the brakes hard at the end of the runway in the clip. It must have looked incredible and sounded even better in person, but at least we can get the next best thing thanks to Saint1’s sweet video. The Bone can be a nimble aircraft for its size at slow speeds and light gross-weights with its wings spread. You can see its massive control surfaces working at full deflection in the video. In fact, that maneuver looks a lot like what you would see in this B-1B air show demo . And just as a bonus, he shot another video of the detachment of B-1’s going out on their first in-theater mission a couple of days ago.

detresfa_,"Updated on Jun 16, 2021",Major Construction Underway At Three Of China’s Airbases Closest To Taiwan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China is upgrading three airbases located opposite Taiwan, boosting its airpower capability in an already tense region that is flush with air combat capabilities. Construction of the new infrastructure began in early 2020 and continued uninterrupted through the pandemic, underlining its priority. The work at the Chinese air force’s bases at Longtian, Huian, and Zhangzhou, all of which lie between 100 and 200 miles from Taiwan, give it an enhanced forward presence near the Taiwan Strait. This, when coupled with the flurry of flights through Taiwan’s ADIZ , all appear to be in line with Beijing’s evolving aggressive posture towards the island nation. Google Map/base image One development that could sustain better operations and replenishment while catering to a variety of missions is the likely construction of munition bunkers at Longtian Airbase. Minor expansions can also be observed at both ends of the runway, along with the development of new aprons with visible markings. Four hardened aircraft structures are seen taking shape at one end of this airbase, becoming the only protective aviation infrastructure on site. Protective shelters for aircraft have multiple benefits beyond the obvious defense attributes. With advances in satellite imagery, these shelters would also help keep aircraft inventory and their general readiness away from prying eyes. In addition, the construction of administrative buildings and possible barracks points to a rise in personnel. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION At nearby Huian Airbase, similar patterns can be seen, with the construction of three storage bunkers, likely for munitions, minor runway extensions, and expansions of aprons underway. The upgraded aprons at both bases could suggest a future increase in aircraft deployments. At the very least, they would be able to support air combat capabilities surging into the area. Interestingly, the site is also receiving four hardened aircraft shelters, which will be in addition to the existing 24 sunshade-type shelters already functional at the base. The investment in developing these bomb-proof shelters could also be based on a threat assessment of a Taiwanese counterattack. They could be especially useful for supporting alert operations, as well. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Not far away, at Zhangzhou airbase, there is observable construction of a new surface-to-air missile defense site, the third one for the same location. These dedicated surface-to-air missile defense sites at the three airbases have also been actively rotating equipment and training. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION These developments are in addition to other air combat-related construction projects along the Strait, in particular, the construction of a massive heliport that would be critical for all types of operations—from anti-submarine warfare to airborne assaults—during a major conflict with Taiwan. When analyzed, China’s rapid upgrades suggest steps are being taken toward improving survivability and concealment of assets and operations, as well as expanding the capacity for surge operations. There have been no visible changes in the deployment of aircraft to these bases as of now, but, strategically, these improved facilities will allow for more operations aimed at intimidating Taipei or could be used in support of actual amphibious and airborne assault operations. @detresfa_ is an independent open-source intelligence analyst who has worked as a consultant to The Intel Lab, an independent intelligence analysis group who is reachable at detresfa@protonmail.ch detresfa_ Contributor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 6, 2021",The Army Plans To Fire Its Version Of The Navy’s SM-6 Missile From This Launcher,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has released a graphic showing the various components it expects to be part of its first operational “Mid-Range Capability” battery, which will be able to employ ground-launched SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles . Most notably, it shows the unit will have four trailer-mounted, multipurpose launchers that are similar, if not identical, to one the Pentagon used to conduct a test of a land-based Tomahawk two years ago. A derivative of that same launcher, which is based on the U.S. Navy’s Mk 41 Vertical Launch System design, was tested on an unmanned surface vessel earlier this year. The Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) released the new information about the planned composition of its first Mid-Range Capability (MRC) unit during a presentation at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference in Washington, D.C., which opened on Monday and wraps up today. The service has also disclosed that the complete MRC weapon system is now named Typhon, an apparent reference to the deadly giant serpent from Greek mythology. The full Typhon briefing slide from the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office presentation., U.S. Army Each Typhon launcher has four cells and is installed on the trailer in an articulated mount that allows for it to be carried in a horizontally stowed configuration during transit. This is the same general configuration as the launcher the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) previously tested onboard the Ranger Â unmanned surface vessel (USV) in cooperation with the Navy. That USV has been used in multiple experiments as part of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program, which you can read more about here . A similar, but less robust, trailer-mounted version of this launch system test-fired a Tomahawk missile in 2019. See the game-changing, cross-domain, cross-service concepts the Strategic Capabilities Office and @USNavy are rapidly developing: an SM-6 launched from a modular launcher off of USV Ranger. Such innovation drives the future of joint capabilities. #DoDInnovates pic.twitter.com/yCG57lFcNW — Department of Defense ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@DeptofDefense) September 3, 2021 As for what the Typhon launcher will be able to fire, the Army announced last year it had selected ground-launched versions of the Navy’s SM-6 and Tomahawk cruise missiles as the initial weapons for its MRC battery. The most up-to-date SM-6 variant in service now , the Block IA, is ostensibly a surface-to-air missile but has a secondary ability to strike surface targets. The Tomahawk is primarily a land-attack missile, but current versions also have an antiship capability .Â The new, Block IB variant of the SM-6 is in development now. It is expected to boast hypersonic speeds and have other improved capabilities, as you can Â read more about here , and could be added to the Typhon system’s arsenal in the future. Similarly, improved versions of the Tomahawk series of missiles, including types further optimized for antiship use, are also in the works. The modular nature of the Typhon launcher, thanks to its Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) heritage and the canisterized missiles the system uses, will only make it easier to integrate other weapons over time.Â An M983A4 tractor truck, a variant of the Oskhosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) family, is the prime mover for these launchers. This will provide a degree of offroad mobility, as well as general road-mobile capability. The Army uses M983A4s as prime movers for, among other things, Patriot surface-to-air missile launchers as well as the new trailer-mounted launchers for the Army’s future Dark Eagle Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW). Â The MRC Battery Operations Center (BOC) will also be trailer-mounted and pulled by an M983A4. Each MRC battery is expected to have one BOC, which will link the unit into various fire control networks , including the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JDOCS). It seems likely that the Army would eventually move to link Typhon into its Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), which is presently focused more on integrating air-defense systems but is expected eventually to take on a broader role. You can read more about IBCS in this past War Zone feature . A trailer-mounted reloading system, able to carry at least four canisterized missiles, as well as a Humvee-based BOC support vehicle, round out the major equipment that will be found in the planned MRC battery, according to the Army. It is somewhat interesting to compare this overall battery composition to that of the U.S. Air Force’s Ground Launch Cruise Missile (GLCM) units that were active toward the end of the Cold War. The GLCM weapon system featured nuclear-armed BGM-109G Gryphon variants of the Tomahawk loaded into four-round trailer-mounted launchers. It had two command centers on trailers for every four launchers, instead of just one in the Army’s MRC battery, something that seems mainly to reflect various general technological improvements in the intervening decades, including the continuing miniaturization of computers and other advanced electronics. A graphic showing a typical Ground Launched Cruise Missile unit organization, with four launchers lined to two trailer-mounted launch control centers (LCC)., Public Domain Typhon is just one part of a large push by the Army to develop and field a variety of new long-range strike capabilities. The service has already outlined plans for including an MRC battery in a future Strategic Fires Battalion construct, together with a battery armed with Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles and another with the combat-proven High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). A new long-range missile, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), is in development now for use with the HIMARS launcher, as well. An organization chart the Army has released showing the possible components of a future Multi-Domain Task Force, including a Strategic Fires Battalion with an MRC Battery, among other elements., U.S. Army The Army sees Typhon, as well as Dark Eagle, as key a contribution the service will make in any future high-end conflict against near-peer adversaries, such as China or Russia. Earlier this year, it emerged that U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) had specifically included future Army and Marine Corps ground-based cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles as important parts of a broader plan to deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region. In addition, it’s important to note that Typhon, especially when combined with established missile types such as the SM-6 and Tomahawk, simply offers a lower-risk and lower-cost option for increasing the Army’s long-range strike capacity compared to more novel weapon systems like Dark Eagle. Of course, the MRC system will not have the range and other capabilities that the LRHW brings to the table, which the Army still very much sees as an important part of its future mixture of capabilities for prosecuting an array of target sets.Â It seems very possible, if not plausible, that Typhon, or another system that uses the same basic launcher, could be of interest to the Marine Corps, as well, which is also exploring the possibility of fielding ground-based Tomahawks in the future. With the test involving Ranger , the Navy has already demonstrated how a variant of this launcher could be rapidly integrated onto various maritime platforms, even relatively small ones, as well. As it stands now, the Army wants to have a prototype MRC battery with a limited operational capability established no later than September 2023. This is a similar timeline for when the service hopes to have fully stood up its first battery armed with Dark Eagle missiles. All told, the new details about Typhon and the planned MRC battery are just the latest examples of how the Army is steadily working toward a new, long-range missile-armed future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 29, 2021",This Is Our Best Look Yet At North Korea’s Hypersonic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has staged an unprecedented exhibition of some of its most advanced weapon systems , including a recently revealed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle missile system, as well as an intriguing new missile design apparently intended for launch from a submarine . The display of military technology comes amid rapid developments in the field of missile systems, both in the North, and its adversary in the South . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was on hand to review the weapon systems that were on display yesterday as part of the Self-Defense 2021 exhibition held in the capital, Pyongyang, to mark the 76th birthday of the ruling Workers’ Party. Kim took the opportunity to declare that the country was building up an “invincible military” to face off perceived aggression from the United States . The North Korean leader also pointed to military developments in the South and described his country’s efforts in this direction as being “to prevent war itself and to literally increase war deterrence for the protection of national sovereignty.” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addresses officials in front of the road-mobile Hwasong-16 intercontinental ballistic missile., North Korean State Media Attracting the most interest at the Pyongyang exhibition was what North Korea claims is a new hypersonic missile, apparently intended to carry a nuclear warhead. The first test of this weapon, called the Hwasong-8, was reported late last month . As predicted, the weapon comprises a ballistic missile carrying a boost-glide vehicle . Previously, the North Koreans had released only one photo of this weapon, but we now have the chance to get a better look at the boost-glide vehicle, in particular, which appears broadly similar to that used on China’s DF-17 missile . However, the North Korean boost-glide vehicle is still, for all intents and purposes, a “shape,” and we have no idea as to whether it has been tested in flight after separation from its ballistic missile carrier, or what other kinds of test articles might exist to support the program. As the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said last month , “It appears to be at an early stage of development that would require considerable time for actual deployment.” That said, it is evidence, at least, of North Korea’s grand ambitions to enter an exclusive club of nations with hypersonic missile capabilities , as well as developing ever more advanced rockets in general, including the apparent introduction of factory-furnished liquid-fuel “ampoules” for increased reliability and stability. Perhaps the other standout item was an apparently new weapon displayed among an array of known submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) designs. The new missile is significantly smaller than the previous SLBMs, especially the Pukguksong-5 first revealed in January this year, but its position in the display and black-and-white markings suggest that it, too, is intended for submarine launch. Unusually, the new missile features a distinctive grid-fin arrangement at the base, similar to that found on certain Soviet-era short-range ballistic missiles. The compact possibilities offered by folding grid-fins could have resulted in their choice for a submarine-launched weapon. It should be noted that Pyongyang has a new missile submarine of some description currently under conversion, in addition to the ones it has used for testing in the past . Smaller weapons would of course mean a single boat could potentially carry more of them, while the shorter range such a weapon would offer would not necessarily be an issue for targets in South Korea or Japan, for example. Another new missile type shown is an apparent short-range ballistic missile, the so-called “March 2021” SRBM, displayed alongside the previously known KN-23 and KN-24. The new weapon reportedly flies on a depressed trajectory, on a lower and flatter profile, which reduced the time between launch and impact, like the Russian-made Iskander . Of the earlier pair, we now also know that the KN-24 has the official name Hwasong-11NA. We have seen the KN-24 in the past, of course, when it was shown publicly for the first time at a parade in January before examples were fired into the Sea of Japan in March this year. The huge Hwasong-16 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that made its public debut during a military parade in October last year was also on show, on its 11-axle transporter erector launcher (TEL) vehicle. According to experts, however, this missile is yet to be test-fired . Kim in front of the Hwasong-16., KCNA Another recently revealed North Korean missile included in the array at Self-Defense 2021 is a surface-to-air missile (SAM), displayed alongside what appeared to be two new types of air-defense radars. This was our closest look yet at the new SAM, which features a two-stage configuration and no fewer than four sets of control fins. Other missiles on display included another ICBM that was tested in 2017 and the rail-mobile ballistic missile that was first revealed last month, and which you can read more about here . Another recently revealed system, a ground-launched cruise missile , was shown outside of its launch canister, while its five-round wheeled TEL was also on display. As well as all these missiles, various other kinds of conventional weapon systems were shown, including antitank guided missiles, small arms, and a main battle tank, which we have profiled in the past . Outside the exhibition halls, there was also a flypast by military jets, plus a demonstration of martial arts, and a lycra-clad parachutist trailing an enormous flag. While not all the weapons displayed at Self-Defense 2021 have been tested, and there are question marks about the practicality of fielding some of the missiles in particular, it seems clear that Pyongyang aims to apply pressure on both South Korea and the United States, while negotiations about its nuclear weapons program remain stalled. At the same time, officials in Pyongyang are aware of the value of high-profile weapons programs, exhibitions, and parades for domestic consumption, especially at a time when sanctions are hitting hard and the COVID-19 pandemic is compounding an already precarious domestic economy . North Korean militia and personnel in hazmat suits during a parade in the North Korean capital last month., North Korean State Media While the Biden administration has made it abundantly clear that it is willing to resume talks with North Korea, offering to discuss lifting sanctions if Pyongyang gives up its nuclear weapons, these overtures have so far been rejected. Instead, North Korea has doubled down on reinforcing the very same capabilities that it’s being encouraged to give up. At the same time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) believes that North Korea has likely restarted its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, which is believed to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. In the meantime, a growing arms race is developing between North and South Korea, too, with new missiles, in particular, seeming to surface with regularity. Indeed, the past few months have seen an almost tit-for-tat situation on the peninsula, with each new development on one side seemingly met by a response in kind from the other. With a generally more modern feel than previous events of this kind in North Korea, Self-Defense 2021 also marked a prominent reversal compared to the style of the previous parade in the capital , in which missile systems and other key weapon systems took a distinct back seat. Overall, the latest exhibition provides ample evidence of the remarkable expansion of North Korea’s military capabilities — and especially its development of an increasingly wide variety of missile systems.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 24, 2023","The Air Force’s New 5,000-Pound Bunker Buster Bomb Breaks Cover","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has successfully completed a series of tests of a new 5,000-pound-class bunker-buster bomb , the GBU-72/B. This included the release of a prototype of the weapon from an F-15E Strike Eagle combat jet over a range associated with Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The testing of this weapon, developed under a program variously referred to the Advanced 5,000 Pound Warhead or Advanced 5,000 Pound Penetrator, and abbreviated A5K, took place earlier this year, but the Air Force only announced the results today . The flight tests followed an earlier round of ground testing, including an arena test , where the bomb’s warhead was detonated inside an array of barriers to gather data about its blast and other effects. The 96th Test Wing at Eglin said that this was the largest such explosive test event in the base’s history but did not identify what weapon previously held that record. A picture of the arena test of the warhead for the 5,000-pound-class GBU-72/B bunker-buster bomb., USAF Outwardly, the GBU-72/B itself looks essentially like an enlarged 2,000-pound class GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bomb configured with a bunker-buster warhead, such as the BLU-109/B or the improved BLU-137/B. The latter of these was originally known as the Advanced 2000 Pound Warhead, or A2K, and you can read more about that bomb here . This 5,000-pound-class weapon uses a modified version of the GBU-31/B’s tail kit, which contains a GPS-assisted Inertial Navigation System (INS) guidance package. This new bomb differs most visibly from the GBU-31/B series in that it has a pair of long fins or strakes, one attached to each side of the bottom of the bomb’s body. GBU-31/B-series JDAMs have a set of strakes that attach to the center of the weapon. A close-up of a prototype GBU-72/B bunker-buster bomb., USAF GBU-31/Bs with bunker-buster warheads., USAF The Air Force also touted the heavy use of modeling and simulation in the development of the GBU-72, as well as to explore its projected lethality. “An advantage to the modeling and simulation to design approach used is early prototypes are production representative,” James Culliton, the GBU-72 Program Manager, said in a statement. “This helps us bring our operational test partners in sooner with eyes-on, hands-on participation, validating our design and procedures sooner while including input that improves the weapon.” “The GBU-72 was developed to overcome hardened deeply buried target challenges and designed for both fighter and bomber aircraft,” according to an official Air Force press release. “Lethality is expected to be substantially higher compared to similar legacy weapons like the GBU-28.” The GBU-28/B is a 5,000-pound-class precision-guided bunker-buster that uses a Paveway-series laser guidance system and that first entered Air Force service in 1991. These weapons were originally developed due to concerns about the ability of the BLU-109/B to reach certain deeply-buried targets in Iraq in the lead up to the first Gulf War. To help rush these weapons into service, the BLU-113/B warheads used in the first batch of GBU-28/Bs had cases that had been fashioned from the barrels of retired U.S. Army 203mm howitzers. The Air Force subsequently employed GBU-28/Bs during the NATO-led bombing campaign over Serbia in 1999, and during the early stages of the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The U.S. government has since exported examples of these weapons to Israel and South Korea. An F-15E Strike Eagle drops a GBU-28/B bunker-buster bomb., USAF The exact capabilities of the Air Force’s current GBU-28/Bs, which now use improved BLU-122/B warheads, are classified, but the original design reportedly had the ability to penetrate through more than 150 feet of earth and at least 15 feet of reinforced concrete. As already noted, the service expects the GBU-72/B to have much better performance. A now-outdated graphic that still provides some useful perspective regarding the comparative capabilities of the BLU-109/B bunker-buster warheads used found on certain variants of the GBU-31/B, as well as the GBU-28/B and the much larger GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator., DOD via GlobalSecurity.org At present, the GBU-28/Bs offer the Air Force the only intermediate conventional bunker-busting capability between the aforementioned variants of the GBU-31/B and the 30,000-pound-class GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). The Air Force is understood to only have a relatively small number of MOPs and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is the only aircraft certified to employ them operationally. The service does have nuclear gravity bombs with bunker-busting capabilities, the B61-11 and the B83-1 , but those weapons are not in any way available for any kind of routine operational use and are not precision-guided. A B-2 Spirit stealth bomber drops a GBU-57/B MOP., USAF capture As such, the GBU-72/B looks set to offer an improved bunker-busting capability for use against targets that are out of reach of GBU-31/B-series bombs, but that do not warrant the employment of a MOP. There is certainly no shortage of potential deeply buried, hardened facilities that the Air Force could be called upon to try to destroy in a future conflict, especially one against Iran or North Korea , where this additional flexibility in weapon options could be extremely valuable. In addition, the GBU-72/B’s use of the JDAM GPS/INS guidance package rather than the GBU-28/B’s laser guidance will give the Air Force the ability to conduct these types of strikes in any weather. Dense cloud cover, smoke, and other obscurants can impede the use of laser-guided weapons. The GBU-72/B would allow the launching platform to stay further away from the target, providing an added margin of survivability, too. GPS/INS guidance does mean that the GBU-72/B can only be used against fixed points, but deeply buried, hardened facilities are also not generally, in any way, a mobile target set . In addition, in recent years, particularly during U.S. operations against ISIS in Iraq, 2,000-pound bunker-buster bombs have been routinely employed against less traditional hardened target sets. This has included tunnel networks and above-ground buildings . In the latter instances, bunker-busters, with their delayed blast effects, have offered a way to try to limit collateral damage to adjacent structures and their occupants. As was the case with the GBU-28/B, it seems likely that a number of U.S. allies and partners, including Israel and South Korea, will be interested in acquiring stocks of the GBU-72/B, as well. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also presented with similar hardened target considerations in the context of potential future conflicts with Iran. Right now, the Air Force says that additional test flights as part of ongoing developmental and future operational testing of the GBU-72/B are set to continue into 2022. The announcement today shows that the service has already taken important steps forward toward fielding its newest bunker-buster bomb.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 8, 2021",Why Multi-Billion Dollar Nuclear Submarines Still Run Into Things Underwater,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On October 7, 2021, we learned that one of the U.S. Navy’s prized Seawolf class nuclear fast attack submarines—one of just three ever built—had suffered a serious underwater collision . The incident supposedly occurred while the USS Connecticut (SSN-22) was operating in or very near the tumultuous South China Sea . The damaged submarine subsequently limped its way to Guam so that the damage can be assessed. Thankfully, nobody on board died and the vessel’s nuclear reactor remained in a safe condition. Exactly what Connecticut hit remains a mystery, but many have expressed their utter puzzlement to us as to how a multi-billion dollar nuclear submarine that is laden with some of the most capable sensors on the planet — literally one of the most advanced vehicles mankind has ever built — can just run into something below the waves. USS Connecticut seen underway during better times., USN With that question in mind, we reached out to veteran submariner Aaron Amick , a friend and contributor to the site and the proprietor of Sub Brief , who spent 20 years as a sonarman aboard America’s attack and ballistic missile submarine force , as well as an instructor to new sonarmen. If anyone could give us the bottom line on how incidents like this can keep happening , as well as what would have happened aboard Connecticut after the collision and what might come next for some of the crew, he could. Just as we thought, he certainly did just that. Here is our exchange: What are the pitfalls and blind spots that could result in a multi-billion dollar submarine loaded with the most advanced sensors on earth colliding with something underwater? Submarine navigation requires very detailed knowledge of the immediate surrounding area. There are two common methods of achieving safe, submerged navigation: Detailed charts and active high-frequency sonar employment. Highly accurate charts are always the first choice. Active sonar transmissions are used to confirm the water depth checks with the chart. These active sonar pulses can be transmitted in front and to the sides of modern submarines. These short-range, high-frequency sonar systems reveal nearby underwater objects with great clarity. Submerged objects, such as mines, wrecks, and other submarines are plainly visible to a trained sonar operator . The downside to the use of active sonar is that it is detectable and at approximately two times the range it allows the operator to search, in most ocean environments. A typical high-frequency, high-resolution sonar may see out to 5,000 yards and is vulnerable to detection out to least 10,000 yards or farther in good conditions. This means an adversary can localize a submarine’s position, and it can remain undetected while trailing the active-sonar emitting submarine for as long as it uses its high-resolution sonar. Sonarmen aboard a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine., DOD PHOTO BY PETTY OFFICER 1ST CLASS DAVID C. LLOYD, U.S. NAVY. (RELEASED) This vulnerability to detection is why active sonar is rarely used. If bottom-mapping sonars verify the submarine’s position on the chart, there is less need to use a high-frequency, forward-looking sonar that may reveal your position. U.S. Navy charts are the most accurate charts in use today. They are digital (with paper backups), which allows them to be updated more frequently. Ideally, every sub in the U.S. Navy has the most recent chart that accurately reflects reality outside the hull. In practice, we have found that this is not always the case. Some areas of the world have tens of yards between soundings, these blind spots may hide topographical formations that rise up from the bottom into a submarine’s operating envelope. If a submarine is operating in an area where they suspect the presence of adversary submarines, they may choose to not use high-frequency active sonar to verify surrounding topography. This, as described earlier, is because the sonar transmissions will give away their position if detected. This means the submarine relies on accelerometer dead-reckoning for the ship’s position. This type of navigation has very small errors that compound over time. Eventually, the submarine can be out of position by hundreds of yards or more. The error grows with time until the next navigational fix. There are ways to fix the submarine’s position that doesn’t involve sonar, but they don’t reveal what topography is hidden between soundings on a chart. How can other submarines and the emergence of unmanned underwater vehicles be a factor? Collision with manned submarines in the South China Sea is a very real concern. The body of water is bordered by many nations that operate conventional and nuclear-powered submarines. China operates the largest submarine base in Asia, Yulin Naval Base , in the South China Sea. At any time, there could be multiple submarines operating in the area. A Los Angeles class fast attack submarine at periscope depth., USN Cooperative nations like Australia and Vietnam work with allies to manage water space and avoid collisions. This helps mitigate the risk of collision. Other countries that do not deconflict submarine operations pose a real risk to themselves and other submarines. The risk of submarine collision in the South China Sea is more likely than in other areas of the world because it’s a very busy area for vessels of all types, including submarines. The increased activity makes passive sonar less effective. Submarines can, and will, hide in noisy areas to mask their passive broadband signature with background noise. The means two submarines may pass very close to each other, and neither will hear the other, if background noise is loud enough to mask both submarines. Unmanned underwater vehicles are changing the way we operate submarines. UUVs can operate in very shallow or restricted waters that a nuclear submarine would not be able to. UUVs use a combination of sonars and artificial intelligence to navigate submerged with less risk to human life. If a UUV runs aground, it doesn’t risk damaging a nuclear reactor or injuring crewmen because it has neither. This capability has put UUVs in high demand and employed by many navies around the globe. The South China Sea is supposedly very challenging to navigate for submarines in some areas, especially large types. Is its unique underwater ‘littoral’ topography a major issue? The topography of the South China Sea is very difficult to navigate because of its high tectonic activity. The bottom is in a constant state of change. Some areas of the South China Sea are very deep, with sudden changes in depth to very shallow, near vertical-like structures that can rise to the surface. Topography of the South China Sea. , NASA These pinnacles are navigation hazards and, if not detected in time, may result in a submerged collision. Measuring bottom depth below the submarine may not give it enough time to maneuver out of the way of a near-vertical topographical change just ahead. What generally would happen inside a submarine when a collision occurs? Is the decision to limp back to port under the submarine’s own power a challenging one to make? The standard procedure during a collision while submerged is to immediately move shallow and maintain positive buoyancy on the trim. The Collision Alarm is sounded. All hands report to predetermined damage control stations with gear in hand. An announcement is made over the 1MC circuit, and all spaces will report damage to Damage Control Central (DC Central). Any additional damage like flooding or fire as a result of collision will be dealt with by the crew and coordinated by the person in charge in DC Central. As the submarine comes shallow, the Officer of the Deck will determine if it is safe to surface immediately. If it is safe, the submarine will come straight up to the surface and assess the situation. This all happens in a matter of seconds. Having good situational awareness at all times is key to safe recovery from any casualty and prevents compounding the casualty by colliding again with an overhead vessel. Crewman train to respond to damage aboard USS Rhode Island. , USN At this point, the submarine will not submerge again if the hull is compromised in any way. If the sonar dome is damaged, for example, there may be more damage in the ballast tanks that is not visible. Therefore, the submarine will remain on the surface until it returns to port. The largest concern, after crew safety, is the nuclear power plant. Containment is very important and will be checked immediately. The pumps and valves that service these high-pressure, high-temperature systems are very robust and designed to withstand shock, but systems checks will be run on every system in the engine room to ensure nuclear safety. Historically speaking, what happens to commanders of boats where collisions have occurred in the past? Historically speaking, the Commanding Officer will be relieved of command at the earliest opportunity. A command qualified officer from the Submarine Squadron will typically take command unceremoniously and an announcement will be made to the crew. The Executive Officer will not take command, typically. USS San Francisco pulling into Guam after its impact with a seamount.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 16, 2021",This Is Our First Look At The Marines’ Loitering Munition-Armed Light Armored Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israeli firm UVision has shown off the first pictures of a U.S. Marine Corps 8×8 LAV-25 -series wheeled armored vehicle with a multi-round launcher for loitering munitions, which are often described as “suicide drones.” The company had announced earlier this year that the Marines had selected this launch system , together with a variant of the Hero-120 loitering munition, as the winning entry for its Organic Precision Fires-Mounted program. UVision released the photographs of the modified LAV-M, which is the mortar carrier variant of the LAV-25, as part of its official unveiling of the Multi-Canister Launcher (MCL) at the Association of the U.S. Army’s main annual conference in Washington, D.C., which opened today. A lower resolution image of the MCL by itself on the ground during a live-fire test had previously emerged . A US Marine Corps LAV-M mortar carrier vehicle fitted with UVision’s Multi-Canister Launcher., UVision “UVision was recently awarded a contract to supply the Hero-120 aerial loitering munition and multi-canister launchers to the United States Marine Corps for its ‘Organic Precision Fire Mounted’ (OPF-M) program,” Jim Truxel, CEO of UVision USA, UVision’s American subsidiary, said in a statement . “As part of this project, the MCLs will be installed on various platforms. We are proud that this latest development will be used in the field soon.” Though the Marines have selected a service-specific variant of the Hero-120 , UVision says the eight-cell MCL is capable of launching any version of that loitering munition, as well as other members of the Hero series, such as the Hero-30 and Hero-400EC . All these weapons are fired from the MCL via preloaded launch canisters, making it easier to load the desired types based on the situation or reload the entire launcher. “Giving field forces operational flexibility, the innovative capability enables them to choose and launch the most suitable system, depending on the nature of the mission and target — from the Hero-30 for smaller ‘surgical’ attacks, through the Hero-120 for medium-sized and armored targets, up to the Hero-400 for long-range and fortified targets,” according to UVision. The Hero-120 has a warhead weighing just under 10 pounds and a maximum range of just under 25 miles using a line-of-sight datalink. It can remain aloft for up to 60 minutes. It is not clear how the Marine Corps’ Hero-120 OPF variant differs from the standard type. Earlier this year, UVision did say that it had developed a new multipurpose warhead with improved antitank capabilities for the Hero-120, as well as the Hero-400EC. The smaller Hero-30, which has around 30 minutes of endurance and a warhead weighing just over 1 pound, and the larger Hero-400EC, with its nearly 90 pound warhead and 120 minutes of flying time, can both be configured with the same datalink, giving them the same maximum range. UVision says that Hero-400EC can also be configured in a way that extends its effective range out to 93 miles. All three loitering munitions, as well as other types in the Hero family, have nose-mounted TV and infrared video cameras that allow the operator to see what the munitions “see” throughout their entire flight. It is that camera capability that separates loitering munitions, such as the Hero types, from more traditional missiles. It allows them to operate as small surveillance and reconnaissance drones and then strike any targets their find directly. UVision’s designs can also be recovered and refurbished for reuse if they complete a mission without conducting a strike. The operator-in-the-loop nature of most loitering munitions , a technology that Israeli companies pioneered and continue to lead in the further development of, allows the user the make very fine course corrections in flight, further improving the weapon’s accuracy. It also provides an added margin of safety, since the operator can direct the munition away from the target area, if necessary, even very late in the terminal stage of a strike, should circumstances change, such as the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders. The onboard navigation systems on the Hero series mean they can be used to strike fixed targets at specific coordinates, beyond-line-of-sight, as well. The Marine Corps sees loitering munitions, among other new weapon systems , as essential to enabling the new distributed and expeditionary concepts of operations the service is in the process of refining. These concepts, broadly referred to as expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO), are at the core of how the Marines expect to fight in the future, including in high-end conflicts against near-peer opponents such as Russia or China. This is also driving a dramatic force-wide restructuring that you can read more about here . A weapon such as the Hero-120 certainly offers a new way for even relatively small Marine ground units to conduct precision strikes at extended ranges, while also expanding their overall situational awareness. It gives those same units this kind of capability in the absence of more traditional air or artillery strikes , as well. This could be extremely valuable in distributed operations across a broad front, such as in the Indo-Pacific region, where other types of indirect fire support may not be readily available. The Marines are also planning on mounting MCLs loaded with Hero-120 OPFs on small unmanned boats , which would be capable of launching swarming attacks on enemy ships, as well as land-based threats near to the shore. The service has implied that its versions of the Hero-120 may have the ability to operate in networked swarms themselves. In a maritime context, while loitering munitions such as the Hero-120 would not be large enough to sink enemy warships or even smaller boats such as landing craft, they could be used to cause a mission kill by damaging key systems, such as radars or communication antennas. This, in turn, could effectively put those vessels out of commission for an extended period while repairs are made. Targeting the bridge on patrol boats, landing craft, or similarly sized vessels might be enough to take them out of the immediate fight, as well. “These swarming aerial munitions, which employ automatic target recognition, have proven exceptionally lethal in recent global conflicts, most recently in Europe,” General David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, told members of Congress in June. “Our own tests have also demonstrated this technology to be effective, with five of five successful shots during testing. We plan to equip our infantry and reconnaissance Marines with this loitering capability, mounting those munitions on both ground vehicles and long-range unmanned surface vessels.” Marines, one of whom is carrying a Javelin antitank guided missile trainer, on a small rubber boat during a training exercise in Japan in 2021. The Marine Corps is exploring novel ways to employ these missiles, among other weapons, including in potential future high-end conflicts against near-peer adversaries. Loitering munitions will give even relatively small units additional capabilities to engage targets at extended ranges., USMC Berger was almost certainly referring to Azerbaijan’s heavy use of Israeli-made loitering munitions during its conflict with Armenia last year, which catapulted this category of weapons into the mainstream discourse like never before. That, in turn, has only prompted additional interest in these weapons and the capabilities they offer within the U.S. military, as a whole. Previous reports have indicated that there is already another Hero-120 variant, the Hero-120SF, specifically designed for U.S. special operations forces. In March, Northrop Grumman announced it was working with UVision on an air-launched hybrid Hero-120/Hero-400 design to meet U.S. Army requirements . UVision is planning to conduct a demonstration of at least some portion of its product line at the Army’s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah sometime this month , with representatives from the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) also in attendance. The new MCL could certainly be of interest to the Army and Navy, as well as SOCOM, for ground-based and maritime applications. The Air Force might be interested in variants of Hero for air-launched use, too, having already demonstrated something of a similar capability in a test involving the launch of an ALTIUS 600 small drone from the internal bay of a larger XQ-58A Valkyrie unmanned aircraft. As already noted, UVision’s Hero series is already making significant inroads across the U.S. military and is part of a future that is getting ever closer, in which American forces will increasingly be armed with various tiers of loitering munitions.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",One Of U.S. Special Operation Command’s Shyest Spy Planes Has A New Name,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the shyest aircraft types operated by U.S. Special Operations Command — the specially configured twin-turboprop Dash 8 SOCOM Tactical Airborne Multi-Sensor Platform , or STAMP — has been given the name Foxhound, it’s recently been revealed. The information emerged as part of an announcement that the modifications were recently completed on the latest example, which SOCOM acquired to replace one lost in a terrorist attack in Kenya last year. A recent Facebook post from the U.S. Army’s Program Executive Office, Intelligence, Electronic Warfare & Sensors (PEO IEW&S) reveals the new name which, of course, the Dash 8 STAMP shares with the Russian MiG-31 interceptor , antisatellite , and long-range strike platform. The Army’s aircraft is based on the drastically different De Havilland Canada DHC-8, or Dash 8, airframe, a popular regional airliner that’s increasingly adapted for military surveillance purposes , too. It’s unusual, but not entirely unheard of for the U.S. Department of Defense to approve popular names for systems that replicate reporting names for potential adversary systems — one less direct example is the U.S. Navy’s C-2 Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft and the Russian-made Pantsir-S1 self-propelled gun/missile air-defense system, codenamed SA-22 Greyhound. In the past, it seems deliberate efforts were sometimes made to avoid potential confusion, the Soviet Yakovlev Yak-28 having its reporting name switched from Brassard to Brewer, apparently due to the similarity to the name of a French liaison aircraft, the Max Holste MH.1521 Broussard . Since it originates from an official U.S. Army account, we can be more or less certain that Foxhound is at least a quasi-official name for the complete system, especially since the service has a long history of applying nicknames to aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. It’s interesting to note that U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command operates a fleet of militarized Dornier Do-328 twin-engine light transports designated as C-146A Wolfhounds . The Air Force also operates a Do-328 ISR testbed, nicknamed Cougar , in support of SOCOM projects. The latest such aircraft (Foxhound 4) underwent a yearlong modification process transforming it to STAMP configuration. “With the addition of Foxhound 4, the SOCOM team will now have greater flexibility in scheduling missions and performing engineering upgrades to improve Foxhound capability and reliability,” the same Facebook post adds. Last year it was reported that Leidos Holdings Inc. had received a $22.7-million contract to modify a Dash 8 aircraft to support SOCOM requirements, with funding from the fiscal year 2020 budget as well as “defense-wide appropriations.” The work was to be completed at Bridgewater, Virginia, and, while no further details were released, it seems fairly certain that this was Foxhound 4, which replaces an earlier example that was among the aircraft destroyed in a brazen attack by Al Shabaab terrorists on an airbase in Kenya in January 2020. The remains of the Dash 8 in the aftermath of the Al Shabaab terrorist attack on Camp Simba/Manda Bay in Kenya on Jan. 5, 2020., AL SHABAAB/VIA @RONCLIFFEODIT The first two Dash 8 STAMPs replaced two other mysterious spy planes based on the earlier Dash 7 airframe. Those aircraft had been used to perform discreet persistent surveillance missions, including in support of counter-terrorism missions in Libya , among other locales. Beyond that, we still don’t know a whole lot about these enigmatic aircraft, their sensor fits, and overall capabilities. The first two Dash 8 STAMPs were previously operated by Dynamic Aviation , which provided contracted surveillance on behalf of the U.S. Army. That involved flying the aircraft, N8200L and N8200R, in different configurations in support of two programs: Desert Owl and Saturn Arch. One of the Dynamic Aviation Dash 8s, registration N8300S, while flying as part of the Desert Owl program in 2015., Bill Word N8200L was transferred to the SOCOM fleet in 2017, with N8200R apparently entering service the following year. While the original Desert Owl configuration involved a PedRad 7 synthetic-aperture radar plus an electro-optical sensor turret, Saturn Arch incorporated a vague-sounding “Mission Sensor System,” and another sensor known as “Big Green.” The Saturn Arch system was specifically designed to provide an aerial ground-penetrating sensor capability that could detect shallow-buried objects, helping in the hunt for improvised explosive devices. Other equipment on both these aircraft included a secondary camera turret, a hyperspectral camera, and a compact wide-area optical camera system . Information gathered could be transmitted back to ground exploitation stations or shared with troops on the ground in near real-time, via a satellite datalink. It’s unclear which, if any, of these sensors are now incorporated on the SOCOM-operated Dash 8 STAMPs, but it appears likely that they fly the same kinds of persistent surveillance missions , where they monitor fairly wide areas and build up a picture of the ground situation in the areas of interest. Detailed monitoring of the ground in particular areas over time makes it possible to determine ‘ patterns of life ’ that could reveal the presence of high-value targets or militant groups. As The War Zone has hypothesized in the past, it’s also possible the Dash 8 STAMPs very are fitted with signals intelligence, or SIGINT, equipment that would allow them to detect and monitor enemy communications, including cell phone signals . It could also be the case that the aircraft now known as the Foxhound carries a sensor fit that’s actually more in line with the Army’s new RO-6A aircraft, which are also based on the Dash 8 airframe but which comprise a notably distinct fleet and one that you can read more about here . These especially well-equipped aircraft carry a wide variety of sensors including electro-optical, infrared, and hyperspectral cameras, as well as wide-area surveillance systems, powerful imaging radar, and SIGINT payloads. Derived from the Dash 8, the Saturn Arch aircraft serves as the basis for the RO-6A., U.S. Army Meanwhile, the existing STAMP fleet has also received further specialized equipment to prevent hostile forces from jamming their GPS navigation systems, as The War Zone reported back in 2018 . This reflects wider concerns about the vulnerability of the satellite-based network to physical and electronic attacks . As well as the Dash 8s, the STAMP program also oversees at least three smaller twin-engine Beechcraft King Air B300s . You can read more about these similarly secretive aircraft here . It’s hard to say exactly how official the Foxhound name is and, indeed, whether it will be applied more regularly to the Dash 8 STAMP in the future. Up until now, these aircraft and their operations have gone about their activities in a highly covert manner. With that in mind, the appearance of any official news release related to them is of interest and, hopefully, further details of this unique fleet might be revealed in due course.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",This Is The Most Incredible Tour Of A B-52 Stratofortress We Have Ever Seen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It may be an overused axiom, but the B-52 is truly like a fine wine — it just keeps getting better with age . With the Stratofortress — the youngest of which will hit 60 years old next year — finally getting new engines , the type will have more range and better field performance, payload, maintainability, and economy. This, combined with significant sensor , avionics, survivability , weapons , and networking upgrades, as well as its new internal smart bomb racks , will see the “BUFF” through to the second half of this century and probably beyond . Yes, 100-year-old B-52s flying in active service isn’t just possible, it is becoming more probable with each passing day. I have discussed the iconic Cold War-era air-combat system with those who flew and maintained it, regularly written about it at length, and just generally never stopped learning about it year after year. Yet the video below, posted on aviation photographer Erik Johnston’s fabulous Youtube channel , is the most comprehensive tour of a B-52 I have ever seen. Running nearly two hours in length, the video goes into so many tiny details about the aircraft, which exists today as a hodgepodge of early Cold War engineering and retrofitted modern technology. The tour is led by Lt. Col. Aaron Bohl and his highly experienced crew, based out of Barksdale AFB in Louisiana, as well as a crew chief for the B-52 being examined, which carries the nickname “Politically Incorrect” embossed below mushroom cloud nose art. The B-52 community retains its nuclear mission, of course, albeit without nuclear gravity bombs — just nuclear-tipped cruise missiles are used these days. Also, just the idea of being a B-52 crew chief sounds overwhelming, doesn’t it? From discussions of a B-52H’s tire pressure and “six-engine approaches” — apparently, it can go around on just two engines in some circumstances — to pointing out where the 20mm cannon shells once dropped out of the tail when the type still had a tail gun , this video is as fascinating as it is thorough. We even get a very intimate description of how the B-52’s now famous, but once-secretive, swiveling landing gear — which is critical to the type’s ability to accomplish crabbed crosswind landings — is set from the cockpit. Then there is the reality that B-52 Weapons Systems Officers crawl into the weapons bay in flight. Another little door at the other end of the bay is where the gunner would have to squeeze through to get to their lonely station in the tail. There are so many smaller things, too, such as the safety bars installed on the ground in the bay so the doors don’t close on anyone standing in it, which could presumably cut a person in half. Oh, and the dumb-bomb racks that the B-52 uses internally are the same as the ones used on a World War II B-17! As for its TF33 engines, they hold 41 quarts of oil, and all eight suck 20,000 lbs of fuel an hour at idle . That is nearly the entire fuel load of an F-15C with two drop tanks. Maybe my favorite part is when the crew chief smiles lovingly at one point as he states, “You’re always hearing creaks and pops,” while he walks atop the aircraft’s wings. Also of note, the inside of the tail of the jet looks more like what you would find in an engine room of an old ship than on a transonic bomber. In addition, the tour is a reminder that ‘B-52ing’ is truly a team sport, and we are not even seeing the army of maintenance people that keep these aircraft flying — not just at Barksdale AFB, but also at the B-52’s depot at Tinker AFB . Above all else, this video highlights just how complex yet brilliantly engineered these aircraft, which could arguably be considered antiques at this point, truly are.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 18, 2022",Chinese Flying Wing Drones Launch Swarming Decoys At Enemy Warships In Industry Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An interesting clip from a Chinese state television segment has emerged online. Shot during the most recent iteration of the country’s Zhuhai Airshow, which wrapped up earlier this month, it shows what appears to be a video presentation depicting navalized derivatives of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle employing air-launched decoys to swarm a pair of surface warships. The state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) had this video running as part of its overall display at Zhuhai. Hongdu Aviation Industry Group, which makes the GJ-11, is a subsidiary of AVIC. The clip in question, seen in full in the Tweet below, also bears the logo of CCTV-7, a China Central Television channel that has been primarily focused on programming related to the country’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) since 2019. The CCTV-7 footage does not appear to show the entirety of the AVIC video. Promotional video for the shipborne version of the GJ-11 drone shown by the AVIC  at the China Air Show. pic.twitter.com/RDw8COgPAA — 彩云香江 (@louischeung_hk) October 7, 2021 What we do see of the AVIC video in CCTV-7’s footage begins with one of the apparent GJ-11 derivatives taking off from the deck of what looks to be a Type 075 amphibious assault ship . The first of these ships entered service earlier this year, representing a major milestone for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), and there are already two more in different stages of construction. The PLAN is expected to eventually acquire a fleet of at least eight of these ships in the coming years. A screengrab from the AVIC video depicting what appears to be stealthy UCAV based on the GJ-11 taking off from a Type 075 amphibious assault ship., CCTV-7 capture via Twitter The People’s Liberation Army Navy’s first Type 075 amphibious assault ship., VIA @_老年_ FROM WEIBO This is immediately intriguing in that it indicates that the PLAN may be interested in operating fixed-wing unmanned aircraft, including unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) like the GJ-11, from its Type 075s, in addition to flying them from the decks of its growing fleet of supercarriers. Last year, what looked to be a mockup of a drone helicopter had appeared on the deck of the first of these amphibious assault ships while it was still undergoing initial trials ahead of its commissioning.

Des images montrent que le nouveau Z-20 fait également parti du voyage. pic.twitter.com/oWR9ehfSts — East Pendulum (@HenriKenhmann) October 3, 2021 The video then moves on to show a flight of four of these UCAVs deploying air-launched decoys. The general exterior shape of the decoys is extremely similar to that of Raytheon’s ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) series, which you can read all about here . MALDs are essentially small cruise missiles that have electronic warfare suites in lieu of traditional warheads, which, depending on the exact variant, allow them to jam enemy radars or attempt to fool their operators into believing that large groups of aircraft or missiles are coming at them from various directions. A group of air-launched decoys, with lines running between them to show that they’re networked together, seen in the AVIC video., CCTV-7 capture via Twitter The air-launched decoys in AVIC’s video look extremely similar to Raytheon’s ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) series, an example of which is seen here, , Raytheon The AVIC video even mimics those from Raytheon itself promoting the MALD family, which often show the decoys morphing into “ghost” aircraft as a visual representation of the false signatures these decoys pump out. In the case of the Chinese footage, the aircraft depicted may be intended to represent a long-rumored , but still not officially confirmed navalized variant of the FC-31 stealth fighter . “Ghost aircraft” seen in the AVIC video representing the false signatures generated by the air-launched decoys. Their shape may be meant to reflect the FC-31 stealth fighter design, or a navalized variant thereof., CCTV-7 capture via Twitter The first FC-31 prototype takes off at the 2014 Zhuhai Airshow., WC/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The Raytheon promotional videos for MALD seen below show general scenarios that are very similar to what is depicted in the AVIC footage. The UCAVs and their decoys then approach two enemy warships, one of which fires a surface-to-air missile at one of the faked aircraft. The last bit of footage we see is of six of the drones swarming these ships. Each one is shown aiming a beam of some kind at them, which could represent an onboard electronic warfare system or even a directed-energy weapon. A swarm of stealthy drones hit two warships with “beams,” which could represent electronic warfare or directed energy weapon attacks, in AVIC’s video., CCTV-7 capture via Twitter It is important to note that it’s unclear how much AVIC’s video presentation reflects aircraft and other systems, as well as concepts of operations to go with them, that the Chinese are actively pursuing now. At the same time, it does depict capabilities that it’s hard to believe the PLA would not be interested in. Stealthy UCAVs launching decoys and otherwise capable of conducting swarming operations, which inherently have the ability to overwhelm defenders, would be immensely valuable in support of maritime operations, as well as those over land. Beyond being able to penetrate to targets themselves using these tactics, they could help neutralize enemy defenses to open a pathway for follow-on strikes, including by non-stealth platforms. GJ-11s, future derivatives, or other similar unmanned designs, could also serve as launch platforms for swarms of smaller drones, as well. This new swarm could carry their own electronic warfare systems to act as stand-in jammers or operate as loitering munitions with the ability to carry out kinetic strikes. In the maritime context, small loitering munitions might not necessarily have the ability to sink enemy ships, but could cause mission kills , or otherwise severely degrade the capabilities of those vessels, by targeting specific systems, such as radar arrays and communications antennas. The complete capability set outlined in the AVIC video is also just another example of China’s long-standing willingness to observe what its principal competitors, especially the United States, are doing and then seek to replicate those technologies, if not outright clone entire systems, often with the aid of very active espionage efforts . The War Zone had already noted this general trend when reporting on the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) FH-97, a stealthy-looking unmanned aircraft design that first appeared at Zhuhai this year that is nearly identical, at least outwardly, to the XQ-58A Valkyrie from U.S. manufacturer Kratos. A mockup of the FH-97, along with other smaller drone designs, on display at the 2021 iteration of the Zhuhai Airshow., CHINESE INTERNET VIA TWITTER Beyond the individual components in the AVIC video, such as the MALD-like decoy, what is depicted is what could easily be part of a larger emerging networked electronic warfare ecosystem. For instance, the clip is reminiscent in a number of extremely broad strokes to what is known about the U.S. Navy’s shadowy  Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors (NEMESIS) program, which you can read more about in this War Zone feature . At NEMESIS’ core is a system-of-systems electronic warfare concept that includes things like drone swarms, ships, and submarines, all networked together to maximize their capabilities, with a particular focus on generating fleets of “ghost” aircraft and warships to confuse enemies and upend their decision-making cycles. Other kinds of swarming capabilities and networked effects, such as enabling groups of precision-guided munitions to operate cooperatively , are now areas of great interest across the U.S. military, as well as among a number of its allies and partners. China itself has already demonstrated significant progress in the development of many relevant technologies, such as swarming capabilities and stealthy unmanned aircraft designs , that it could leverage to support work of the kinds of capabilities seen in the AVIC video. The Chinese government “increasing inventory levels and the sophistication of their weapons and modernizing redundant systems throughout the kill chains that support their weapons,” Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said just last month at the annual Air Force Association Air, Space, and Cyber Conference conference in Washington, D.C. “Hypersonic weapons, a full range of anti-satellite systems, plus cyber, electronic warfare, and challenging air-to-air weapons” were among the specific areas where China has been focusing its efforts, he added. All told, while we can’t say how close China may be to acquiring the capabilities seen in the AVIC video, they are certainly in line with the country’s general ambitions, as well as its steadily growing ability to turn them into operational realities.

The aircraft for sale also has a storied career behind it, and a very reasonable 2,500 flight hours ‘on the clock.’ This, the fastest of privately available antiques, truly represents a unique opportunity for the biggest speed freak among us, and having the chance to own one, in an airworthy condition, is a rarity indeed. Billed as a “Mach Two, Supersonic Jet Fighter” in the Platinum Fighter Sales’ inventory, the two-seat CF-104D features an eye-catching (although strictly ahistorical) silver paint job and an interior that the broker describes as being “restored to stock military configuration — excellent condition.” Platinum Fighter Sales A piece of Cold War history like this jet coming onto the market is not a frequent occurrence anyway, but what really sets serial number 104633 apart is the fact that, given the training, maintenance support, and not inconsiderable budget, you could be flying it yourself, getting to grips with its legendary performance and highly demanding handling characteristics . In fact, if your heart is really set on flying Kelly Johnson’s needle-nosed fighter, there might not be a better example available anywhere in the world. As well as the very reasonable total flight hours (considering it was built back in 1962), the Starfighter has added only 400 hours to that total since a thorough restoration by Unlimited Aircraft, of Chino, California, a specialist in high-performance warbirds from Western and Eastern blocs. The single J79-GE-7 turbojet engine — that will not only propel you through the sound barrier , but provide the aircraft’s legendary howling note — has accumulated 1,200 flight hours since its last major overhaul and two spare turbojets are included in the overall package. Although the Starfighter was last flown in November 2008, it’s been maintained in flyable storage since then and its avionics have been updated to include modern navigation and communications gear from Collins. You’ll still be able to get that original frontline feel, though, should you wish, since the original radar is still installed. Platinum Fighter Sales Platinum Fighter Sales Platinum Fighter Sales As for the jet’s history, 104633 was completed by Canadair for the Royal Canadian Air Force , which used these two-seat models exclusively as trainers. It was delivered in May 1962 and saw more than a decade of service with a test unit at Cold Lake, Alberta, before being sold to another NATO Starfighter operator, Norway, in July 1973. With the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the jet saw another decade or so of use, until being put into storage in December 1982, as the Norwegians replaced their F-104s with F-16s . In 1984 the aircraft was sold to Combat Jets Aircraft Museum at Chino, then transferred to Houston, Texas, and was returned to airworthiness with the U.S. civil registration N104JR. It finally returned to the air at Mojave, California, in 1986, with NASA pilot Ed Schneider at the controls. The CF-104D returns to the air for its first post-overhaul flight by Ed Schneider at Mojave Airport on November 11, 1986: By the early 1990s, N104JR had been transferred to the Experimental Aircraft Association, or EAA , at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, flying demonstrations before being sold again, to Fuel Fresh Inc., in 1996. The plane made the move to the fighter jet mecca of Mesa, Arizona, where it remains to this day, now registered as just N104. Despite its technical credentials, the practicalities of actually flying a potent jet like this are not straightforward . However, N104 currently enjoys FAA registration in the Experimental Exhibition category, meaning it can be operated in the United States under an ‘on condition’ maintenance regime. Essentially, this means parts only have to be replaced when they are deemed no longer airworthy, instead of at predetermined intervals of operation. That is a major bonus for a vintage machine like this and, as Platinum Fighter Sales, points out, this kind of permission “is impossible to obtain today.” Platinum Fighter Sales Platinum Fighter Sales Platinum Fighter Sales An F-104 could hardly be further removed from a general aviation runaround and even compared to a World War II fighter , its maintenance and fuel demands are extravagant. That helps explain why this particular example has only been in the air for around 200 hours in the last 22 years. Based on today’s fuel prices, it costs roughly just over $4,000 to filler her up, and that’s without drop tanks. That entire fuel quantity can be burned by its J79 engine at full power in a matter of minutes. However, if you can afford to run the jet on a regular basis, Fuel Fresh Inc. will supply a comprehensive spares package that includes all you need for some pretty extensive use, including “approximately 150 main gear tires” and “a couple dozen nose gear tires.” You’ll also get spare drag chutes, various control surfaces, canopy and windscreen glass, brakes, tip tanks, and even valves for the boundary layer control system. Platinum Fighter Sales Platinum Fighter Sales Platinum Fighter Sales Clearly, operating a plane in the class of the Starfighter is not for the faint-hearted — or those without deep pockets. Here’s hoping that the jet finds a new home soon and that we might get to see its iconic shape back in the air again before too long.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has taken delivery of the first prototype Airborne High Energy Laser, or AHEL, which is set to be flight tested on one of its AC-130J Ghostrider gunships next year. The service hopes to demonstrate the feasibility of adding this directed-energy weapon to the AC-130J’s already very diverse arsenal , which could give these aircraft a unique capability to engage ground targets silently and stealthily. Lockheed Martin confirmed yesterday that it had completed factory acceptance testing for the AHEL and then turned the weapon over to the Air Force. The laser will now need to be integrated together with a beam control system, after which ground testing will take place ahead of the installation of the complete weapon system onto an AC-130J. An artist’s conception depicting an older AC-130U gunship armed with a laser weapon system., USAF “Completion of this milestone is a tremendous accomplishment for our customer,” said Rick Cordaro, vice president, Lockheed Martin Advanced Product Solutions. “These mission success milestones are a testament of our partnership with the U.S. Air Force in rapidly achieving important advances in laser weapon system development. Our technology is ready for fielding today.” Under a January 2019 contract, Lockheed Martin has been working to integrate, test, and demonstrate the new directed-energy weapon on the AC-130J, according to the company press release, which also noted that it’s now “on a rapid schedule to continue testing this capability.” The entire project is a joint service effort, and, in July of this year, Lockheed Martin’s Aculight Corporation division received a new $12 million, five-year contract award from the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWC Dahlgren) for technical services, integration, test, and demonstration of the AHEL. Exactly when flight testing of an AC-130J armed with the AHEL might begin is unclear, but U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has consistently said it expects to kick off this phase of the project in Fiscal Year 2022, which began this month. As for the power rating of the AHEL, Lockheed Martin’s press release does not say, but, again, SOCOM has repeatedly said it will be in the 60-kilowatt class. This would be in line with Lockheed Martin’s own statements that this airborne directed energy weapon is in “the same class” as the HELIOS laser weapon it is supplying to the U.S. Navy, which also helps explain the service’s involvement in this effort. A slide covering AC-130J laser weapon project that U.S. Special Operations Command released in May 2021., SOCOM Previous reports have said that HELIOS , which stands for High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance, is in the 60-kilowatt class but have also said that the manufacturer has been looking to increase its power to the 150-kilowatt class. Other sources have suggested that HELIOS has a rating closer to 100 kilowatts. You can read more about the Navy’s plans for HELIOS in this previous story of ours. An artist’s concept of the Lockheed Martin HELIOS naval laser system. , Lockheed Martin Even without the AHEL, the AC-130J has an expansive arsenal. This includes a 105-mm howitzer , as well as a smaller 30-mm GAU-23/A Bushmaster cannon. The aircraft can also carry a range of precision-guided munitions, including the AGM-114 Hellfire missile and the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), under their wings. The planes can employ smaller precision weapons, such as the GBU-44/B Viper Strike and GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition glide bombs, as well as the AGM-176 Griffin missile, via Common Launch Tubes (CLTs), too. A US Air Force AC-130J Ghostrider gunship. Its 105-mm howitzer and 30-mm cannon are visible toward the rear and toward the front of the fuselage, respectively, and two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles are seen loaded on a rack under the left wing., USAF However, an operational high-energy laser weapon would be a valuable addition to these existing options, providing it works as advertised. A weapon of this kind could defeat a variety of different targets and do so in a way that opponents might not even know they’re under attack until it’s too late. In one scenario described to National Defense magazine by Lieutenant General Brad Webb, then the commander of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), an AC-130J armed with a high-energy laser could be used to pick out and destroy an electrical transformer, the engine of a pick-up truck, communication equipment, and a parked drone. A similar concept of operation is shown in a 3D rendered video found on Lockheed Martin’s website. “Without the slightest bang, whoosh, thump, explosion, or even aircraft engine hum, four key targets are permanently disabled,” Lieutenant General Webb explained. “The enemy has no communications, no escape vehicle, no electrical power, and no retaliatory intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability. Minutes later, the team emerges from the compound, terrorist mastermind in hand. A successful raid.” This is not the first time the Air Force has experimented with this concept. There were various tests in the 1990s and 2000s that demonstrated the potential value of adding a laser weapon system to an AC-130 gunship. A number of actual live-fire tests of one system, known as the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) were conducted using a C-130 testbed aircraft. Various technical issues, including the size and weight of this 100 kilowatt-class chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL) weapon, as well as its power and cooling requirements, had limited the feasibility of turning this into an operational system. A C-130 testbed aircraft carrying the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL), whose turreted beam director is seen underneath the forward fuselage., USAF While an AC-130J playing out for real the scenario Lieutenant General Webb had described might still be some way off, it’s clear the basic technology required to realize that kind of mission is now within reach. A key breakthrough has been the emergence of solid-state lasers that are far more compact and lighter than the previous chemical lasers. They don’t require the cumbersome and energy-intensive cooling systems of their forebears and, at the same time, previous problems with beam control have been largely addressed. You can read more about the dramatic evolution in the overall feasibility of increasingly smaller laser weapons in recent years in this War Zone feature . That said, it’s not necessarily been an easy path for AHEL to get to this point. At one point, it was hoped that testing on an AC-130J could begin before 2020, but this target proved elusive. Above all, technicians still struggled with scaling down the system so that it could be accommodated aboard an aircraft — even a pretty big one, in the case of the AC-130J. Similar issues have continued to plague other U.S. military airborne high-energy laser efforts, as well. However, the system’s size, weight, and power-and-cooling demands appear to now have been brought in line with the specifications of the Hercules-derived gunship. While its power rating might not give it anywhere near the same immediate destructive potency of the AC-130J’s 105-mm gun, Bushmaster cannon, or precision-guided munitions, the AHEL also won’t run out of ammunition quickly and will be able to strike targets silently with an invisible beam. Even with more limited destructive power, that opens up a way for gunship crews to take out objectives on the battlefield unseen, ideal for more covert operations, or simply to help sow chaos and confusion among enemy forces by disabling critical infrastructure, such as communications and power generation and transmission nodes. It remains very unclear at present how capable the beam from this weapon might be again a person, which could open the possibility of using it for targeting strikes against specific individuals . While the capabilities offered by AHEL, and laser weapons in general, often sound like they’ve come from the pages of science fiction, the latest delivery of a trials system suggests the era of laser warfare from the air may not be so very far off.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 16, 2022",The Iron Dome Air Defense System Is Heading To Guam,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is deploying one of two air defense batteries equipped with the Israeli-made Iron Dome system to Guam. The decision to send Iron Dome systems comes as the U.S. military continues to explore options to expand its air and missile defenses on this highly strategic island in the Pacific as part of broader efforts to deter China in the Indo-Pacific region. The latest versions of the Iron Dome system, which was originally designed to intercept incoming rockets and other artillery rounds , also have a demonstrated ability to shoot down small drones and low-flying cruise missiles . The 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), which is based in Hawaii, announced the deployment , which it described as “temporary” and “experimental,” earlier this week. Troops from the 2nd Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, out of Fort Bliss, Texas, will operate the Iron Dome battery on Guam. Elements of the Army’s 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, forward-deployed in Japan, will also support this deployment, which has been nicknamed Operation Iron Island . The Army has made no secret that a major impetus for this deployment was a requirement in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year. Members of Congress had directed the service to send an Iron Dome battery to an “operational theater” by the end of this year. “Soldiers and equipment … will deploy in order to fulfill those NDAA requirements, test the capabilities of the system, and further train and refine the deployment capabilities of air defenders,” according to a brief press release . “There is currently no plan to conduct a live fire of the system while it is on Guam.” At the same time, the potential threat, broadly, posed by cruise missiles , including advanced supersonic and potential future hypersonic anti-ship and land-attack types, as well as various tiers of drones, is only increasing. Iron Dome would, at least on a limited, interim level, help bolster defenses against these target sets, on Guam right now. Submarines and surface warships, as well as even just modified counter ships , along with long-range missile carrier aircraft , could launch salvos of land-attack cruise missiles at the island during a potential future major crisis, especially one involving China . It is worth noting that drones, especially, present very real threats outside of the bounds of traditional conflicts , as well. As The War Zone was the first to report , there were multiple incursions by unidentified small drones over the THAAD battery on the island in 2019, underscoring the multi-faceted challenges that small unmanned aircraft present already. The Army first announced plans to acquire two Iron Dome batteries in 2019 primarily as an interim cruise missile defense system, with an eye toward purchasing more as time went on. A complete Iron Dome system consists of multiple launch units, each capable of holding up to 20 Tamir interceptors at a time, along with radars to detect and track targets and a battle management and control unit. Tamir is a highly maneuverable missile that contains an active radar seeker to help find its target, as well as two-way datalink that enables it to get updated targeting information from the battle management and control unit in-flight, improving its accuracy. The interceptor uses a ring-shaped high-explosive blast-fragmentation warhead, triggered by a laser proximity fuze, to actually destroy incoming threats. You can read more about Tamir and its capabilities here . However, in 2020, the service pumped the brakes on those plans and ultimately decided against purchasing any more Iron Dome systems, ostensibly over issues integrating it with the new Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) network architecture, which you can read more about in this past War Zone feature . In September of this year, Dynetics announced the Army had awarded it a contract to supply a system called Enduring Shield system to meet the service’s various cruise missile defense and counter-drone requirements as part of its Indirect Fires Protection Capability (IFPC) program. The company’s offering beat out Iron Dome, which a team consisting of that system’s Israeli manufacturer Rafael and U.S. defense contractor Raytheon had submitted to the IFPC competition, albeit rebranded as SkyHunter. The Dynetics system will, at least initially, use the AIM-9X Sidewinder heat-seeking missile as its interceptor. It’s worth noting that the AIM-9X is a significantly more expensive choice compared to Tamir, with the latest subvariants of this Sidewinder version having units costs in the $450,000 range . Though the exact cost of the Israeli interceptors is unclear, past reports have put their price tag at between $40,000 and $100,000 . A rendering of two launch units associated with Dynetics Enduring Shield defense system firing AIM-9X Sidewinders., Dynetics In the meantime, the Army has still been dutifully establishing an interim capability with its new Iron Dome systems, the first of which was delivered in September 2020. The service had announced in August of this year that troops from 3rd Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery, also based at Fort Bliss, Texas, had conducted the first live-fire tests of what it has dubbed the Iron Dome Defense System-Army (IDDS-A), at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. “Soldiers … successfully engaged eight cruise missile surrogate targets as part of a coordinated performance test and live fire event,” according to a statement at that time. Even with all this in mind, the deployment of Iron Dome to Guam does make good sense from testing and operational perspectives. As already noted, the U.S. military is presenting developing a plan to expand air and missile defenses on this island in the face of growing potential threats, particularly from China. There has been discussion about adopting a distributed, potentially mobile approach rather than establishing a singular new fixed missile defense based on the existing Aegis Ashore architecture , as you can read more about here . As it stands now, there is already an Army battery equipped with the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system on the island, which provides a measure of ballistic missile defense, but certainly not enough to defeat a high volume strike . The various components of the Army’s Iron Drone system are all palletized and are therefore capable of being readily moved around on and off-road using variants of the Oshkosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). This would offer a way to explore methods of employing more dynamic air missile defenses on Guam that could help inform future planning. A US Army Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) carrying a radar associated with the Iron Dome system., US Army An Army HEMTT-series truck carrying a palletized command van that is part of the service’s Iron Dome system., US Army The tactics, techniques, and procedures the service has been developing for Iron Dome would likely be applicable, at least to a degree, to the employment of other similar systems, such as Dynetics’ Enduring Shield, in the future, as well. All told, while Iron Dome’s future with the Army is anything but certain, there is much the Army stands to glean from this initial, experimental deployment of this system to Guam.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 11, 2022",Air Force Stumped By Sudden Pitch Down Events Reported On Upgraded KC-135 Tankers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Crews on U.S. Air Force KC-135 tankers with the Block 45 upgrade package have been prohibited from engaging the aircraft’s autopilot at altitudes under 10,000 feet, except in very certain circumstances, due to a curious chain of events. Air Mobility Command imposed this restriction after receiving reports of at least two instances where the nose of one of these aircraft suddenly pitched down with the autopilot engaged, a potentially very dangerous occurrence. A subsequent investigation initially indicated that the autopilot might have been switching off entirely unexpectedly, but the Air Force now says it is confident that the system has actually been working as intended and plans to rescind the current flight restriction within days. Air Force Major Hope Cronin, the Public Affairs Operations Division Chief for Air Mobility Command (AMC), confirmed that the restrictions on the use of autopilots on Block 45 KC-135s under 10,000 feet are still in place and provided additional details about the investigation into the issues that prompted them in the first place. The War Zone had reached out to AMC after examining an unclassified Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) notice, which appears to have been first issued sometime between April and May of this year, detailing the flight restrictions imposed after the reported “uncommanded pitch down” incidents. One of the first two KC-135s to receive the Block 45 upgrades., USAF “The restriction was put in place before the investigation had completed as a precaution,” Major Cronin told The War Zone in a statement. “The restriction was left in place out of an abundance of caution while investigating autopilot servos to ensure no loss of power caused a delay in autopilot disconnect capability.” A new autopilot is a key component of the Block 45 upgrade package, which you can read more about here . Since the mid-2010s, the Air Force has had many of its KC-135s brought up to this standard, and the upgrades are also available to foreign operators . What was then Rockwell Collins developed the complete package, which has since been supplied in kit form for installation on KC-135s. In 2018, United Technologies Corporation bought Rockwell Collins, which now operates as Collins Aerospace. One of the most visible changes to KC-135s as part of the Block 45 upgrade process is the replacement of a central panel full of old “steam gauges” in the cockpit, seen at right, with a new, wide-area digital multi-function display, seen at left. , USAF The prior block 40 KC-135R’s autopilot was extremely basic, with no auto level-off, airspeed hold, or vertical speed hold for climbs and descents. As such, some KC-135 pilots were excited to get these functions as part of the Block 45 upgrade, but have been dismayed with the system, which was not cheap to procure, after it was put into limited use due to the pitch down events. The lack of an autopilot under the current restrictions is especially an issue when flying at lower altitudes for prolonged periods of time or when recovering after extremely long missions. The FCIF, which came from Air Mobility Command’s Directorate of Operations, Aircrew Standardization, and Evaluation, or A3V, said that restrictions on using that autopilot were first put in place after “two recent incidences in Block 45 [KC-135] aircraft where the autopilot initiated an uncommanded pitch down.” “In both cases the pilot and copilot were unable to disconnect the autopilot using the TOGA [takeoff/go-around]/disconnect switch or stabilizer trim inputs,” it continued. “One incident occurred at 2,500 feet AGL [above ground level] in the traffic pattern. The cause of the two events remains unknown.” “An attempt to replicate one of the incidences in the simulator showed that the use of the Sync button may allow pilots to initially correct the uncommanded autopilot input, but that the autopilot will likely resume its uncommanded input upon releasing the Sync button,” it added. Another view inside the cockpit of a KC-135 with the Block 45 upgrades., USAF No details are provided about how steep the reported pitch downs were or how long it took for the aircraft’s crew to regain full control. Any such occurrence could have had potentially dangerous implications, particularly for aircraft flying at lower altitudes. This, in some indirect ways, is reminiscent of the now-infamous issues with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), a flight stabilization system, onboard Boeing 737 MAX airliners that also produced uncommanded nosedives that were key contributing factors in two separate fatal crashes , which killed nearly 350 people in total, in 2018 and 2019. After the second of those accidents, aviation regulators around the world ordered the jets grounded and they only began returning to the skies late last year. The entire debacle became a major scandal for Boeing, which was shown to have been less than forthcoming about what it knew beforehand regarding the system’s potential risks. With regards to the Block 45 KC-135s, the FCIF said that crews were prohibited from engaging the autopilot at altitudes under 10,000 feet, “unless required for an approved test plan, functional check flights, an RNAV [area navigation] departure, or during air refueling.” It also included a list of troubleshooting options if the pilot or copilot had trouble disconnecting the autopilot, with the last suggested option being to pull a circuit breaker. However, the Air Force says that its investigation into this matter has not found any issues with the autopilot itself and that data it collected indicated these systems weren’t even engaged during the reported uncommanded pitch downs. This had, in turn, led to concerns that the autopilots might be switching themselves off inadvertently, something the service has said does not appear to have been the case, either. “The investigative team discovered the autopilot did not in fact command a pitch down,” Major Cronin said. “Analysis was accomplished on flight data recorder and autopilot servos, resulting in conclusions that the system functioned as designed and that autopilot was not actually engaged during this timeframe.” “Our engineers and maintenance teams are working to determine the cause, and thus far have been unable to duplicate this issue or had it take place on other modified aircraft,” Air Force Captain Christopher Herbert, another AMC spokesperson, had also told The War Zone in response to an initial query regarding this issue. It is worth noting that the mention of the troubleshooting done in a simulator as mentioned in the FCIF only described an “attempt to replicate one of the incidences,” not a definitive recreation of the reported problems with the autopilot. Air Force personnel sit inside a KC-135 simulator. Note the cockpit seen here reflects a pre-Block 45 configuration., USAF As it stands now, AMC says they expect to finally lift the autopilot-related flight restrictions entirely this Friday. This is the only flight restriction currently in effect for Block 45 KC-135s. Still, with no real explanation about what caused the reported pitch down incidents that prompted the issuing of the FCIF in the first place, the entire matter remains somewhat puzzling. “A survey was created to gather pertinent data on any issues that may not be covered by data gaps in flight recorder,” Major Cronin said. “Crews have been encouraged to continue reporting any issues they have via safety, maintenance, and standardization and evaluations channels.” Hopefully, no new reports of uncommanded pitch downs will emerge and the previous incidents will remain bizarre flukes that thankfully did not lead to any accidents. On the other hand, if they continue to occur, the service isn’t in much better of a position to explain them than they were months ago.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 11, 2020",Watch Saudi F-15 Strike Eagles Unleash Harpoon Missiles Against Ship Targets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During recent bilateral maritime maneuvers with their Pakistani counterparts, F-15SA fighters operated by the Royal Saudi Air Force, or RSAF, have demonstrated one of the Eagle’s lesser-known capabilities — knocking out warships and other vessels using AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles . The RSAF also showed off its ability to strike such targets at a considerable distance, with Harpoon-armed F-15 jets flying nonstop from Saudi Arabia to a location off the coast of Pakistan with tanker support. The F-15SA jets — the most advanced versions of the Eagle operated by the RSAF — were taking part in a Pakistani/Saudi Arabian drill called Naseem Al Bahr XIII, which began last Sunday. This is the first time these Saudi jets, based at Dhahran on the Persian Gulf coast, have taken part in Naseem Al Bahr exercise series. Official video, seen below, appears to show at least two targets destroyed, although it’s also possible that these were hit by surface-launched anti-ship missiles from Pakistan Navy or Royal Saudi Navy warships, or helicopters, in the same exercise. While the F-15SA and other advanced derivatives of the U.S. Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle are known for their ability to carry a wide range of ordnance , precision-guided and otherwise, the aircraft are not often seen carrying Harpoon anti-ship missiles. In fact, other than South Korea, Saudi Arabia is the only operator known to have integrated Harpoon on its Eagles. However, Qatar is also buying the ship-killing missiles for its fleet of F-15QA jets, aircraft you can read about in more detail here . Plans to integrate the Harpoon on the F-15SA were revealed in 2016 , with work carried out by Boeing under a Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) contract. The variant of the missile involved was the AGM-84L Harpoon Block II, the current version of the weapon in production with Boeing. In advance of that contract, the Saudi government requested the purchase of 400 AGM-84Ls as part of a wider weapons buy worth an estimated $6.8 billion. Another more recent order , placed with Boeing by NAVAIR last year, covered another 402 Harpoon Block II missiles for Saudi Arabia, although these may well also include surface-launched versions. The AGM-84L incorporates a combined GPS/inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package that provides accurate mid-course updates to improve accuracy. This technology had migrated to this missile from the Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response ( SLAM-ER ) missile, which is itself a land-attack derivative of the Harpoon. Other features of the SLAM-ER found in the AGM-84L include the mission computer and software. Otherwise, the key features of the AGM-84L are an active radar seeker for terminal guidance and a 500-pound high-explosive warhead, the effects of which have been repeatedly proven in sinking exercises, or SINKEX, of the kind you can see here . The missile has a range of at least 75 miles. A pair of RSAF F-15SA jets, each armed with two AGM-84L Harpoon missiles., @MbKS15/via Twitter With regional adversaries including Iran, with its extensive maritime activities in the Persian Gulf and, increasingly, further afield, Saudi Arabia’s demand for powerful anti-ship capabilities is clear. Just across the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia faces the threat from both the Iranian Navy and the parallel Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy. While these forces include considerable numbers of smaller fast in-shore attack craft , as well as semi-submersibles and submarines , they also feature missile-armed corvettes and even an expeditionary sea base-type vessel, which could be likely targets for more powerful anti-ship weapons like the Harpoon. Indeed, while the effort to buy F-15SA jets and upgrade existing F-15S aircraft to the same standard has been a very significant one, more broadly, Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in its maritime capabilities, in general. These will be boosted to a significant by major U.S. weapons sales agreed under the previous Trump administration, including four Multi-Mission Surface Combatants (MMSC), based on the U.S. Navy’s Freedom subclass of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). These will also be armed with Harpoon anti-ship missiles, in one of the many notable differences between it and the original Freedom subclass. An artist’s conception depicting the Multi-Mission Surface Combatant now under construction for the Royal Saudi Navy., Lockheed Martin In the past, The War Zone has looked at efforts to modernize and expand the previously relatively small Royal Saudi Navy, making it better able not only to counter regional threats, such as Iran and the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who also operate widely at sea, as well as to project power beyond the Middle East. In the meantime, Saudi Arabia has built up a formidable naval fleet ranging from frigates to small patrol boats and acquired from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Having the ability to launch anti-ship strikes from the air not only provides an additional offensive capability to support these warships’ missions, but also a means to defend them. In the past, Riyadh has also looked at buying P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, which would enhance surveillance capabilities in the wider region and which can also be armed with Harpoon missiles . A Harpoon is released from an F-15SA during the Naseem Al Bahr XIII exercise., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP By demonstrating its ability to attack naval targets beyond the Persian Gulf, made possible by using tanker support, the RSAF and, by extension, the Saudi Arabian military shows it can match Iran’s effort to project power out of its traditional operating areas. In recent years, for example, Iranian warships have operated in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean and even ventured as far as South Africa and the Baltic Sea, via the English Channel . As well as securing its two strategic shipping choke points closer to home, Saudi Arabia’s maritime strategy also increasingly calls for maintaining a robust, persistent presence in the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Red Sea. For operations in the Arabian Sea, Pakistan is an important ally, as reflected in this week’s Naseem Al Bahr XIII exercise. These maneuvers saw the Pakistani and Saudi Arabian contingents practice joint maritime security operations in what the Pakistan Navy described as “traditional and non-traditional warfare domains.” As well as warships from both navies, which also launched anti-ship missiles, embarked helicopters from the Pakistan Navy and Royal Saudi Navy also took part.

As it stands, whether operating in waters closer to home, or further afield, the niche Harpoon missile capability inherent in Saudi Arabia’s F-15SA fleet provides a very potent means of prosecuting anti-ship attacks, and one that will help bolster the country’s wider naval modernization efforts.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 5, 2021",American Forces Have Been Quietly Deployed To Taiwan With Increasing Regularity: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report from The Wall Street Journal says that contingents of U.S. special operations forces and U.S. Marines have been making more regular rotational deployments to Taiwan for at least a year now. This news comes a day after Chiu Kuo Cheng, the island’s defense minister, said publicly that Chinese forces would be capable of launching a “full-scale” invasion operation across the Taiwan Strait with far fewer risks than they face now by 2025. Approximately 24 American special operators and other supporting forces are apparently on the island now, “conducting training for small units of Taiwan’s ground forces,” according to the Journal ‘s story, which was published earlier today . An unspecified number of Marines are also there “working with local maritime forces on small-boat training ,” the outlet reported. It’s not entirely clear from the piece whether or not there has been a permanent or even semi-permanent U.S. military presence on the island for the last year or more. A screen capture from an official U.S. Army video that emerged last year showing Green Berets training with Taiwanese special operators. The video was subsequently taken down., U.S. Army capture The Journal noted that there had been reports last November about a deployment of Marine Raiders to Taiwan, which the island’s Naval Command reportedly confirmed at the time. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense subsequently declined to further confirm or deny the presence of those forces. A Pentagon spokesperson also told Stars and Stripes that those reports were “inaccurate,” but did not elaborate on what specific details were incorrect. “The presence of U.S. special operations forces hasn’t been previously reported,” the Journal ‘s piece incorrectly states. Last June, The War Zone , among others, reported on the emergence of an official U.S Army video, a screen capture from which is seen earlier in this story, showing Green Berets taking part in one iteration of a regular series of Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) exercises on the island, nicknamed Balance Tamper. That video was subsequently taken down. Another report in 2017 also said that U.S. Special Operations Command had released documents showing at least one other deployment of special operations forces to Taiwan the year before. JCETs are very small training engagements that typically involve between 10 and 40 American personnel and focus heavily on practicing general skill sets, as well as exchanging relevant tactics, techniques, and procedures, primarily with other allied and partner special operations forces around the world. This would be well in line with the Journal ‘s reporting of how many American special operators are currently in Taiwan and what they are doing. The Journal ‘s story also makes no note of an unconfirmed report earlier this year that American forces, possibly from the U.S. Army’s 5th Security Force Assistance Brigade , or 5th SFAB, were present at a Taiwanese training base in the town of Hukou in the island’s northern Hsinchu County. There are presently six SFABs within the Army and Army National Guard, which provide dedicated conventional advisory forces. The 5th SFAB, based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State, is focused on supporting security force assistance missions in the Indo-Pacific region. It’s also possible that, if this report of American personnel in Hukou is true, they could be U.S. special operators or Marines. Members of the U.S. Army’s 5th Security Force Assistance Brigade during a deployment to Thailand in 2020., U.S. Army Whatever the exact American force composition in Taiwan is at present and what their assigned tasks might be, the presence of special operators and Marines all makes good sense, as The War Zone has explained in the past . U.S. Army Special Forces units, in particular, are trained to support unconventional warfare campaigns that involve working with or otherwise supporting local forces behind enemy lines during a major conflict. In May, Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, advocated for increased cooperation between U.S. special operations forces and the Taiwanese military, during a confirmation hearing for Christopher Maier, then the nominee to become the next Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict. Hawley specifically cited how the American special operations community has engaged in recent years with the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to counter Russian aggression as a potential model for working with Taiwanese troops going forward. “I do think that is something that we should be considering strongly as we think about competition across the span of different capabilities we can apply, [special operations forces] being a key contributor to that,” Maier, who was subsequently confirmed, said in response. He gave no indication at the time that such cooperation was already occurring. Small boat operations, like the ones the Journal says Marines have been training Taiwanese forces to conduct, would also almost certainly be an important component of any future cross-strait conflict. The Marines themselves have been exploring ways to expand the versatility and flexibility of units using small boats recently, including using rubber rafts as launch platforms for anti-tank guided missiles , developments that The War Zone has been following closely . Marines, including one with a Javelin anti-tank guided missile trainer, sit in a rubber raft during a training exercise in Japan in 2021., USMC Taiwanese troops riding in small rubber rafts., Youth Daily News Though there is no confirmation that elements of the 5th SFAB have been to Taiwan in the past year or so, that would be unsurprising, as well. SFAB detachments could provide a variety of valuable advisory support to the Taiwanese military, including helping units prepare to receive various new U.S.-made weapon systems. The U.S. government has approved an array of arms sales to the government in Taipei in recent years, including advanced Block 70 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, MQ-9B drones , ground-launched Harpoon anti-ship missiles , and much more. Army training teams could be particularly well suited to support Taiwan’s future fielding of things like M1A2T Abrams tanks and M109A6 Paladin 155-mm self-propelled howitzers. Even a small number of American troops in Taiwan on a routine basis could have a deterrent effect because of the potential for any hostile action on the part of the Chinese government to kill U.S. personnel. Any such deaths would, in turn, all but certainly draw a very different kind of response from the U.S. government and possibly trigger mutual defense obligations on the part of America’s allies . A larger force, especially one that is deployed continually, could have an even greater impact on China’s decision-making. It’s also worth mentioning that a strategic framework document for the Indo-Pacific region that the outgoing Trump Administration declassified in January specifically mentioned efforts to “enable Taiwan to develop an effective asymmetric defense strategy and capabilities that will help ensure its security, freedom from coercion, resilience, and ability to engage China on its own terms.” That same document also warned that “China will take increasingly assertive steps to compel unification with Taiwan,” something that has only become more apparent since then. “With regards to staging an attack on Taiwan, they currently have the ability. But [China] has to pay the price,” Taiwanese Defense Minister Chiu Kuo Cheng said yesterday . He warned that, by 2025, that price could be substantially lower, increasing the prospect of a “full-scale” invasion of the island. The Chinese government views Taiwan as a rogue province and has repeatedly threatened to use military force to prevent authorities there from formally declaring independence from the mainland. Over the past year, the People’s Liberation Army has dramatically stepped up provocative aerial activity around the island, as well as an increasing number of naval maneuvers , all of which send clear signals to Taiwanese officials and their international partners. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense says that Chinese warplanes have flown 150 sorties into international airspace within the southwestern corner of its Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) just this month . “China will take all necessary steps to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the country’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement in response to questions from The Wall Street Journal regarding the presence of American troops on the island. “See whether the PLA will launch a targeted airstrike to eliminate those US invaders!” Hu Xijin, the firebrand Editor-in-Chief of the Global Times newspaper, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party, also wrote on Twitter in response to the Journal ‘s story. Hu had previously Tweeted that “If it is true … Chinese military forces will immediately launch a war to eliminate and expel the US soldiers,” after Senator John Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, falsely asserted that there were 30,000 American troops on Taiwan in a separate, now-deleted post on that social media site. The U.S. government currently technically has a “One-China Policy” that has, since 1979, recognized the regime in Beijing and not formally recognized the one in Taipei. At the same time, it reserves the right to engage with Taiwanese officials and support the island’s military until such time as its final status has been conclusively resolved. An ostensibly unofficial U.S. delegation traveled to Taiwan in April at the prompting of President Joe Biden, where they reiterated America’s commitment to the Taiwanese military, among other things. A separate Congressional delegation arrived on the island on a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport plane for a visit in June. If The Wall Street Journal ‘s reporting that the U.S. military has had an increasingly regular presence in Taiwan in the past year is accurate, it would only further underscore America’s continued support for the government in Taipei in the face of rising tensions with the mainland. The increasing emergence of details about U.S. military engagements with their Taiwanese counterparts over the past year or so is notable in itself and seems clearly meant to send a signal to authorities in Beijing. The Pentagon has already declared China to be its current “ pacing threat ,” and the U.S. military as a whole is increasingly focused on preparing for a potential major conflict with and otherwise deterring China in the Indo-Pacific region, in general. The White House said yesterday that Biden will hold a virtual meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before the end of the year, which will almost certainly touch on these and many other issues. That announcement came after National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Yang Jiechi, a senior Chinese foreign policy adviser, in Zurich, Switzerland. In the meantime, the Biden administration, like the Trump administration before it, does appear to be taking a more proactive stance to challenge Chinese ambitions regarding Taiwan, and doing so more publicly, though how this strategy may actually impact the situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait very much remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2021",One Of The Navy’s Prized Seawolf Class Submarines Has Suffered An Underwater Collision (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USS Connecticut , one of the U.S. Navy’s highly advanced and secretive nuclear-powered Seawolf class submarines , is on its way back to port after suffering an underwater collision. The service says that there were no life-threatening injuries among the members of C onnecticut ‘s crew as a result of the accident. The submarine itself is in a “safe and stable condition” and its reactor plant was unaffected and remains fully operational. USNI News was first to report on this accident, which occurred on Oct. 2. The Navy would not say where the submarine was at the time of the collision, beyond in international waters somewhere in the Indo-Pacific region, or what it hit. The service also only said that C onnecticut was now headed to a port in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of responsibility, which includes the Western Pacific Ocean and a significant portion of the Indian Ocean, as well as various bodies of water in between. U.S. 7th Fleet has its main headquarters in Japan. USS Connecticut at Fleet Activities Yokosuka in Japan for a port visit in July 2021., USN U.S. Pacific Fleet has now also issued a formal press release regarding the incident, which is as follows: The Seawolf-class fast-attack submarine USS Connecticut (SSN 22) struck an object while submerged on the afternoon of Oct. 2, while operating in international waters in the Indo-Pacific region. The safety of the crew remains the Navy’s top priority. There are no life-threatening injuries. The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition. USS Connecticut’s nuclear propulsion plant and spaces were not affected and remain fully operational. The extent of damage to the remainder of the submarine is being assessed. The U.S. Navy has not requested assistance. The incident will be investigated. In March, news had emerged that the submarine was suffering from an infestation of bed bugs, which turned into something of a controversy that you can read more about here . The Navy announced in May that Connecticut had departed its homeport at Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton in Washington State for a deployment in the Pacific. The submarine is known to have made at least two port visits in Japan, one in July and one in August. Submarines hitting things while submerged is not necessarily as uncommon as one might think. Just in February of this year, the Japanese submarine Soryu hit a cargo ship while surfacing in the Pacific Ocean. In 2016, the U.K. Royal Navy’s Astute class nuclear attack submarine HMS Ambush also suffered an underwater collision with a commercial tanker off the coast of Gibraltar. The U.S. Navy is no stranger to these kinds of accidents, either, with the USS San Francisco infamously suffering major damage to its bow after hitting an underwater seamount in 2005. These are just some examples. Connecticut is one of only three Seawolf class boats ever built, all of which were originally designed in the twilight of the Cold War to serve as advanced attack submarines. A combination of U.S. defense budget cuts following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the growing costs of the program itself led the Navy the abandon its plans to acquire 29 of the submarines. In 1983, the estimated unit cost of each one of these boats was pegged at $3.1 billion , more than $8.5 billion in 2021 dollars, making them the most expensive attack submarine ever designed. Today, Connecticut, along with her sisters USS Seawolf and USS Jimmy Carter , are particularly well known for their ability to cruise quietly for extended periods of time under the ice in the Arctic and are understood to be heavily engaged in intelligence gathering operations , among other specialized mission sets. Jimmy Carter is itself the lone example of a distinct subclass, with that submarine featuring a 100-foot long extension called the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), which, along with other modifications, give it additional capabilities to perform underwater espionage operations, as you can read more about here . Given the small size of the Seawolf fleet and the already costly nature of the design, the Navy may be looking at a particularly large repair bill to return the submarine to active duty depending on the severity of the damage that Connecticut suffered in this collision. There are no spare donor hulls to serve as ready sources for spare parts or even complete structural sections to help reduces and otherwise speed up the process. At the same time, the Navy may feel compelled to spend whatever it takes to preserve the advanced capabilities that this boat offers. The service is only now in the early stages of developing a new class of attack submarines that it wants to have Seawolf -like capabilities . Regardless, thankfully, it does not appear that anyone was severely injured in this accident. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Updated 4:30 PM EST: USNI News has now reported that 11 sailors on the USS Connecticut suffered minor to moderate injuries in the accident. Military Times reported separately that a U.S. official had described the injuries as “bumps, bruises and lacerations.” Connecticut is present due to arrive in Guam today, where it is already Friday, Oct. 8. There are now reports that the collision occurred in the South China Sea , as well. As for what the submarine hit, details remain limit. U.S. officials have reportedly said that there are no indications at present that the “object” was another submarine. “An official who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak on the record said that the area’s topography at the time did not indicate there was a land mass in front of the boat,” Military Times reported.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 14, 2021",Newly Declassified Data Shows Unexplained Increase In U.S. Nuclear Warhead Stockpile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At the latest official public count, the U.S. military possesses a stockpile of 3,750 nuclear warheads , with approximately 2,000 more that have been retired and are awaiting disposal. Under the Trump administration, however, a small but unusual bump in stockpile size occurred between 2018 and 2019, according to these same figures. The unexplained increase in the total number of warheads in inventory is apparently only the second reported instance of its kind since the end of the Cold War. The revelations are among newly declassified details of nuclear weapons numbers in a recently published fact sheet from the U.S. Department of State with the title Transparency in the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile . This is the first time such data has been released since September 2017, after which the Trump administration took the decision to classify the information. U.S. Department of State As the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) observed in their blog on the topic, the stockpile increased by 20 warheads between September 2018 and September 2019, when Trump was in office. Total numbers of nuclear warheads in the U.S. stockpile from Fiscal Year 1962 to 2020., U.S. Department of State While there is no information immediately available to explain that 20-warhead increase, FAS suggests that one possibility is the production of the controversial low-yield W76-2 nuclear warheads for the U.S. Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The-then presidential candidate Joe Biden warned before taking office that fielding the W76-2 was a “ bad idea ” and that the warhead’s existence makes the U.S. government “more inclined to use them” than in the past. Regardless, the Trump administration pushed forward with the production of the W76-2, pointing to Russian plans for the first use of tactical nuclear weapons as justification. According to FAS, the first W76-2 was produced in February 2019 and the final example was completed in June 2020. While that might explain some of the background to the spike, it’s not conclusive, especially since the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has gone on the record to say that some W76-1s were converted into W76-2s, which wouldn’t result in any change in the total number of warheads in the stockpile. An unarmed Trident II D5 missile is launched from the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland (SSBN 738) during a missile test off the coast of Florida in 2016., U.S. Navy/John Kowalski Another possibility relates the spike to the Nuclear Posture Review under the Trump administration, which was released in 2018. This reversed the existing plan to completely remove the B83-1 gravity bomb from service. It could be that the bump reflects a change in retirement schedules there somehow, although the timeline doesn’t seem to match up. Whatever the reason for the spike, the appearance of the newly declassified data is interesting in itself. The State Department fact sheet notes that “Increasing the transparency of states’ nuclear stockpiles is important to nonproliferation and disarmament efforts, including commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and efforts to address all types of nuclear weapons, including deployed and non-deployed, and strategic and non-strategic.” The latest figures are correct as of September last year, revealing that the U.S. has dismantled 711 nuclear warheads since September 30, 2017, when the figures were last made public. Prior to then, the United States had 4,717 nuclear warheads in its stockpile as of September 2014, and 5,113 warheads in September 2009. An unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, during a developmental test, in February 2020., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Clayton Wear It’s also worth noting the classification for warheads in the stockpile, and those that have been retired. The nuclear stockpile includes both operational “ready-for-use” warheads as well as non-operational ones, kept in a depot, which would require longer to make ready. Meanwhile, retired warheads are removed from their delivery platform and are no longer functional, essentially waiting to be dismantled. The fact sheet also compares the latest total to the peak of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile — 31,255 warheads in Fiscal Year 1967 — and the total at the end of the Cold War — 22,217 in late 1989. An infographic showing historic and active nuclear weapons the U.S. military has had in service since the 1940s., NNSA The figures do not provide subtotals of strategic and tactical weapons, although the fact sheet does confirm that numbers of U.S. non-strategic nuclear weapons have declined by more than 90 percent since September 1991. In the past, this category included weapons such as nuclear mines, artillery, tactical ballistic missiles, tactical cruise missiles, tactical gravity bombs, and anti-submarine weapons. Today, this class of weapon has been reduced to gravity bombs, although modernization of these weapons continues. The timing of the latest nuclear warheads fact sheet coincides with a review of nuclear weapons policy and capabilities by the Biden administration. Declassifying the nuclear stockpile information is also likely geared toward next January’s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, in which nuclear powers who have signed the treaty — among the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China — will address the issue of disarmament commitments. The road-mobile DF-41 ICBM is typical of new-generation Chinese strategic delivery systems., KYODO VIA AP IMAGES The State Department’s move could therefore be intended to apply pressure on Russia and China in particular, to release more details about their prospective nuclear stockpiles. Both of those countries are in the process of introducing new and diverse strategic weapons capabilities, while China is thought to have embarked on a considerable expansion of its nuclear delivery systems . An apparent test launch of the Russian 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, a controversial weapon that has suffered a number of mishaps during development work in the past., Russian Ministry of Defense In the case of Russia, the Biden administration may hope that the newly released details encourage Moscow to be more transparent about its own nuclear stockpile within the framework of further extending, or replacing the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START. China, for its part, is not a signatory of New START and while the Biden administration is expected to make a push to include Beijing as well, officials there have been lukewarm in the past about becoming involved in such treaties. As The War Zone has examined in the past , New START places hard limits on the total number of strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems, as well as the warheads that they carry, that each country can possess. The arrangement is seen as being key to preventing a new nuclear arms race between the two powers and the Biden administration is apparently keen to negotiate new arms control deals with Russia, especially given the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , or INF, in 2019. In terms of nuclear policy, the Biden administration, for its part, seems set on continuing much of the strategic weapons modernization that was already underway during the Trump administration, despite the president-elect making calls for reducing spending on nuclear weapons, even stating that “the United States does not need new nuclear weapons.” A drop test of a W88 warhead for a Trident D5 missile at Sandia National Laboratory., DOE Current modernization plans now include replacing LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles with the future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent , or GBSD, at a total cost of around $264 billion . For the Navy, as well as the aforementioned W76-2 warhead, there are also longer-term plans for new ballistic missile submarines as well as upgrades for the Trident SLBMs to keep them viable until the 2040s. The Air Force, meanwhile, expects to receive around 1,000 examples of the stealthy Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) cruise missile to replace the existing Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), to be armed with refurbished W80-4 warheads. This is in addition to its revitalized inventory of tactical nuclear weapons, based around the B61-12 gravity bomb. While the LRSO program has a projected cost of $16.2 billion, the B61-12 is notoriously worth more than twice its weight in gold, as The War Zone has examined in the past . That suggests that despite pre-election rhetoric about pursuing a “ sustainable nuclear budget ,” the nuclear weapons plans of the current administration are more or less business as usual. The hopes of some analysts that the United States might even do away with the ICBM leg of its nuclear triad were swiftly dashed, the Biden administration quickly committing itself to the primacy of the nuclear triad itself — ICBMs, nuclear-capable Air Force bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. All of those areas are undergoing a process of modernization. On the other hand, the latest nuclear weapons fact sheet does seem to signal a clear move toward increasing transparency in terms of nuclear stockpiles. While this would seem calculated as a way of exerting pressure on Russia and China to increase their own levels of transparency in this regard, it remains to be seen how effective that policy might be.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 19, 2021",Have You Ever Seen An AV-8B Harrier Use The Meatball To Land On An Amphibious Assault Ship?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you think of carrier landings, a few essentials probably come to mind—hook, wire, and the “Meatball,” known by its full name as the Improved Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System, or IFLOS. While the Meatball is known to be a critical component for fixed-wing pilots landing on catapult and arresting gear-equipped (CATOBAR) carriers, it’s less known that America’s ‘big deck’ amphibious assault ships (LHDs and LHAs) are also equipped with the system. Thanks to one Harrier pilot that goes by the handle @overdesigned on Twitter , we get to see the system in action right from the cockpit of his AV-8B Harrier. One major difference between the Meatball on America’s nuclear-powered supercarriers and those on big deck amphibious assault ships is where it is mounted. Instead of being installed on the port side amidships at deck height, it is mounted on the island superstructure, on the ship’s starboard side, high above the deck. As you can see in @overdesigned’s video below, he flies the meatball straight in, over the fantail of the ship, before entering into a solid hover and eventually touching down vertically amidships: Left: A Harrier making an approach to an LHD in the Mediterranean with the deck lights and IFLOS illuminated. Right—The IFLOS layout. The center vertical strip provides critical glideslope positioning information. , Seaforces.org/Vladsinger via wikicommons In addition to seeing the Meatball in action, the straight-in approach isn’t something we see much of when it comes to Harrier ops aboard amphibious assault ships. So, with all this in mind, we reached out to the guy at the controls to get more info on this approach, the Harrier’s use of the IFLOS, and more. Here is our exchange: Does the Harrier use the IFLOS in the same way that the CATOBAR jets do on CVNs? Generally speaking yes, in that it gives us visual glideslope from a mile or so out in towards the ship. We transition to a different set of lights once we’re in close though, whereas CVN pilots fly the ball all the way to touchdown. An AV-8B Harrier with Marine Attack Squadron 311, part of the Air Combat Element of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, lands on the USS Essex . , USMC When are straight-in landings used instead of the typical ones where the Harrier hovers to the left of the ship, then walks to the right over the deck in a hover before landing? When we do night landings but aren’t on NVDs [Night Vision Devices], we fly straight up the stern. “Night” is defined as “after sunset” so sometimes you get a pretty bright night landing. Do you “call the ball”—where the pilot acknowledges visual contact with the Meatball at 3/4 mile from the ship and their fuel state—like fixed-wing aircraft operating aboard supercarriers do? Are the radio communications similar in general? For approaches where we use the ball, yep the ball call is the same. There are a couple of extra calls related to the vertical landing that occur after the ball call. For a normal daytime good weather recovery, we just call abeam, no ball call. And then similar to how a CVN LSO [Landing Signal Officer] provides guidance, the V/STOL [Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing] LSO does the same, but again with some specialized terminology related to the hover and vertical landing. Can the F-35B do the same straight-in landings? I am sure they are technically capable, but I couldn’t tell you if it’s a thing they do or don’t do since I haven’t really talked or done anything with any F-35 guys. An AV-8B Harrier lands on the flight deck of the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer at night., DoD What are the most challenging things about lower visibility landings on “amphibs” with the Harrier? Things are difficult with a rolling ship, particularly at night on NVDs, without a well-defined horizon. If you attempt to match the ship’s roll with your aircraft you start to slide laterally, so you have to watch the tramline [centerline of the takeoff and landing area] for left/right alignment while also ignoring the roll of the ship itself. Without a horizon that is challenging. So there you have it. There are some real similarities and differences between how Harriers land on amphibs at night to how fixed-wing aircraft land on supercarriers at night—the latter of which you can read all about here. While the Meatball may still be the go-to aid in both cases, new concepts of operation and capabilities are making recovering aboard ships at night a bit easier. Regardless, as long as humans are at the controls, the Meatball will still be there to lend its guiding light.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2021",This Is Our Most Detailed Look At Russia’s S-70 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle To Date (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television station, TV Zvezda , recently offered the most in-depth look at the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik unmanned combat air vehicle, or UCAV, as well as the work that has gone into it, to date. This includes new views of various features on the drone, including its internal payload bays and the control setup that operators use to fly it, along with behind-the-scenes looks at various aspects of its design and manufacturing process. TV Zvezda ‘s “Military Acceptance” program was given an inside look at elements of the Okhotnik, or “hunter” in English, for a segment that aired this past weekend. The title of the episode, which you can watch in its entirety on YouTube in Russian below, says that this is “chapter 1,” indicating that that the show already intends to come back to this topic with additional information in the future. The Russian military first officially unveiled this very large combat drone, which is really more of a demonstrator than even a prototype, in 2019 after its first flight , though unofficial images had already emerged on social media. Since then, only relatively limited details about the design and its development , as well as accompanying imagery , have been released. Only one of these drones has been completed so far, but at least three others are reportedly under construction. In the TV Zvezda segment, officials from Sukhoi described this drone, which presently carries the bort number Red 071, as a “laboratory,” a Russian term commonly used for testbed assets . Previous Russian state media reports have said that the second example now being built is set to be used primarily as a research and development asset, just like the first one. The third and fourth examples will reportedly be more representative of a final production design. A view of another S-70 now under construction, as was shown to Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu earlier this year., TV Zvezda capture TV Zvezda capture One of the things about the core S-70 design that is most immediately apparent from the footage in the show is just how big this UCAV really is, something The War Zone has highlighted before . TV Zvezda ‘s reporter says that Okhotnik is smaller than Sukhoi’s Su-57 Felon advanced combat jet. However, a clip where he walks from the wing of one of those manned aircraft onto the drone shows that the size difference, especially in wingspan, is minimal. The particular Su-57 seen in this portion of the segment, and others, is one that has been used in various testing in cooperation with the S-70. Among other things, the production versions of the Okhotnik are expected to eventually operate as semi-autonomous “loyal wingmen” networked together with Felons. TV Zvezda ‘s reporter walks from the edge of the wing of a Su-57 onto that of the only complete S-70 currently in existence, highlighting the size of the drone as compared to a large manned fighter., TV Zvezda capture TV Zvezda ‘s reporter walks on top of the S-70, further underscoring its size., TV Zvezda capture This view of the S-70’s underside, with an individual standing almost fully erect, also gives a good sense of its general size., TV Zvezda capture We are also treated to new, close-up looks at the exterior of this flying-wing drone. This includes views of its upper body, which is covered in various intakes and exhausts, as well as antennas, and a forward-facing camera system under the central part of the forward fuselage. A look at the top rear portion of the S-70., TV Zvezda capture A camera system underneath the central portion of the S-70’s forward fuselage., TV Zvezda capture There are also nice views of the UCAV’s very exposed engine exhaust. This is something that The War Zone has noted would limit its all-around stealthiness since the very first images of this unmanned aircraft emerged back in 2019 . The Okhotnik’s overall surface is hardly flush, either, with various exposed fasteners and seams that would negatively impact its radar-evading qualities. TV Zvezda capture We also get a look at the S-70’s internal bays, which TV Zvezda ‘s reporter said the channel was prohibited from filming inside. It’s unclear what, if any, weapons or other internal payloads have been flight tested on this initial example of the Okhotnik so far, but there were reports that the drone had carried some kind of air-to-air missile surrogate during an experiment late last year. A payload bay on the S-70 is seen open in the background., TV Zvezda capture Another framing showing two payload bay doors open. , TV Zvezda capture Beyond the new views of the design, an official from Sukhoi elaborates more on how technology, and even some entire components, from the Su-57 was leveraged to help accelerate the development of the S-70. The drone uses the same main landing gear assemblies as the manned aircraft, for instance. Sukhoi says the S-70 is expected to change significantly, inside and out, between the first two examples and the next two. The most notable expected difference will be the replacement of the exposed rear engine exhaust with a shrouded one, as has been seen previously on models . The intake on those models is also revised compared to what is seen on the Okhotnik that is currently flying. The production examples are also expected to make significant use of composite materials. This would all, at least in principle, help reduce the unmanned aircraft’s radar signature. A model of an S-70 showing the revised low observable exhaust configuration that is expected to be found on production examples. Some of the drone’s control surfaces are highlighted. The inlet has also been reconfigured., TV Zvezda capture The master forms Sukhoi has been using to shape parts, including those made out of composites, for the S-70. Sukhoi workers maneuver a large composite structure, which appears to be a wing-body section for an S-70., TV Zvezda capture TV Zvezda capture It’s also worth noting that it would be highly unlikely that the expected new exhaust configuration on the production-representative S-70s would be able to accommodate an afterburner. Sukhoi representatives did specifically tell TV Zvezda that the UCAV was not expected to be overly fast or maneuverable, relying more on its stealthy characteristics to successfully complete its assigned missions. Beyond all this, at one point in the segment, the reporter from “Military Acceptance” is shown various computer models related to the S-70 and its aerodynamics, including one that appears to show a deep S-shaped engine intake on the drone. It’s not clear if this is a feature on the current demonstrator or the second one in production, or if it is expected to be added to the final design. Either way, this kind of ducting, something that is very prominently not found on the Su-57, helps conceal the engine’s fan face, which would otherwise produce a very large radar signature. A computer model that appears to suggest that the S-70 has, or will have, a stealthy S-shaped main air intake for its engine., TV Zvezda capture Another S-70-related aerodynamic model., TV Zvezda capture A direct screenshot from a Sukhoi computer showing various airflow modeling., TV Zvezda capture Sukhoi touted its use of modeling and digital simulation in the development of the drone, in general. At one point, a representative from the company showed the reporter from “Military Acceptance” a rig used to test the unmanned aircraft’s flight software. The system includes a full physical control system from an S-70 linked to a simulator made up of commercially sourced components. This includes a visual interface with a 3D rendering of a flying wing-type aircraft that Sukhoi insisted was nothing more than a stock graphical asset. The way the system works is that the physical controls are supposed to respond to the tester’s inputs in the simulator as they would on the real drone, allowing engineers to see if things work as intended, albeit in a very rudimentary laboratory environment. A view of the control system test rig for the S-70, with the physical components in the rear and the computer simulator in front., TV Zvezda capture Sukhoi says that this flying wing aircraft rendering used for the control rig simulator is just a stock 3D asset and not a representation of any actual design., TV Zvezda capture Separately from its exploration of the S-70’s design and the development thereof, this episode of “Military Acceptance” also offers a look into the current operator arrangement for the drone. It currently takes a three-person team to fly the Okhotnik, consisting of a pilot/operator, navigator, and communications specialist, all of whom work together inside a containerized control van. The outside of the control van Sukhoi has been using to operate the S-70., TV Zvezda capture The pilot-operator sits in a position that is intended, in broad strokes, to mirror the cockpit of an aircraft, with a traditional control column and various multifunction displays. A view of what is in front of the drone is provided via feeds from its two forward-facing video cameras, which have heads-up-display-like iconography overlaid on top. The navigator and communications positions feature more conventional computers, with the navigator notably also able to view many of the same displays as the pilot/operator. The pilot/operator station., TV Zvezda capture A closer look at some of the displays in the pilot-operator station., TV Zvezda capture The communications specialist’s station, at left, and the navigator’s station, at right. The pilot-operator station is visible in the background behind the divider., TV Zvezda capture This control arrangement is expected to evolve as time goes on, as well, with many of the more traditional plane-like components of the pilot/operator position giving way to simpler displays and computer screens. No details were given about how a pilot of a Su-57 might be expected to interact directly with one of these drones in flight. The plan is for the operation of the drone to become increasingly autonomous, as well. The degree of autonomy currently found in the S-70 is not entirely clear, but it does reportedly have the ability to conduct some level of flight without constant human interaction and has an emergency backup mode to help it get back to base if its connection to the operator is lost for any reason. Still, the expectation, at least a present, is that there will continue to be a human in the loop, at least on some level, when operational Okhotniks enter service. This operating method would severely limit how future S-70s could be employed, potentially forcing them to operate within line of sight to the ground control station or to intermediate communications relay nodes. Russia is not particularly well known for high-speed, beyond-line-of-sight data links, in general. A desktop-like, point-and-click touchscreen user interface that allows various types of commands to be issued would be another key feature for truly semi-autonomous operation of the S-70 in the future. All told, it very much remains to be seen what the production-ready S-70 design will look like, as well as when Okhotniks may actually start seeing real service. The Russian Ministry of Defense currently hopes to begin fielding its first operational examples in 2024. There is, of course, always the potential for delays due to various reasons, including just basic budgetary realities . It seems clear Sukhoi has been trying to leverage work on the Su-57 to help mitigate such risks. However, the production of those jets, as well as their initial development, has been something of a saga , as you can read more about here , and it remains unclear when, or if, Russia will field any significant number of them or in what capacity. With the development of and expected concepts of operation for the S-70 so heavily tied to the Su-57, this can only raise questions about the future of the drone. Using Okhotniks as loyal wingmen could offer one possible way to expand the real combat capacity of what might ultimately only be a small fleet of operational Felons. If the Russians are able to turn the models of the Okhotnik in the stealthier configuration into a reality, then these UCAVs could also help make up for the Su-57’s radar-evading shortcomings, as well, a valuable potential synergy that The War Zone has pointed out in the past . It’s not clear what impact the expectation that the S-70 will be slower and less maneuverable than its manned partners might have on any future manned-unmanned teaming. Of course, these drones could also be employed on their own as true UCAVs if the control arrangement eventually allows for it. As already noted, the current focus on human-in-the-loop operation presents obvious limitations on how the S-70 can be used, including how far away it can operate from its controller, whether they’re on the ground or in the air. No matter what, this latest episode of TV Zvezda ‘s “Military Acceptance” program is certainly a fascinating new look into the S-70 program, and we are already very interested to see what details future “chapters” might contain. Update: It has come to our attention that TV Zvezda has also released looks at components of the planned stealthy engine exhaust for future, production-representative S-70 drones, which you can see in the Tweet below.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C-2 military cargo aircraft isn’t exactly a brand new kid on the block. The aircraft has been in service with the Japan Air Self Defense Force since 2016. But one astute airplane spotter captured a dramatic contrast between the size of it and its forbear, the Kawasaki C-1, at a Japanese airport over the weekend.Â The C-2, actually the first developmental XC-2, which belongs to Japanâ€™s Technical Research and Development Institute, was spotted at an airbase in Kakamigahara, 160 miles or so west of Tokyo, slowly taxiing behind and parking next to an original C-1. Twitter user Rikizo Misono (@misonor) posted the short video, included in the tweet below, on Saturday, and aviation aficionados were quick to share it and follow up with amusing captions in reaction to the impromptu side-by-side comparisons of the â€œparentâ€ and its “child.” Above all else, most were taken aback by the size difference between the two related types.Â Remind me thisâ€¦ ğŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/gG0CMyIs0c — JeanPhi (@jeanphi01) October 4, 2021 pic.twitter.com/eNIivoRdo3 — Thomas Bradley (@TBinAB) October 4, 2021 Add more yeast to C-2 and you'll get your C-3. — zy5y (@zy5y) October 4, 2021 Of course, the cartoon analogies â€” while funny â€” get the relationship between the two aircraft exactly backward. The small C-1 is the older â€œparent,â€ and the much larger C-2 is the “child.”Â Japan developed the C-2 in this century as a successor to the Cold War-era Kawasaki C-1 transport, as the country began to take a greater role in international missions, including peacekeeping and disaster relief. The C-1 began life as an indigenous replacement for hand-me-down U.S. World War II-era piston-engine powered transports. The short-field capable aircraft can travel at a maximum speed of about 430 knots and a relatively modest range that can be described as something between regional and international in nature, which fits with Japan’s defensive strategy when it first entered service in 1974. Its capacity â€” about 18,000 pounds during normal operations â€” is considerably less than even early C-130 models. While the C-1 continues to serve in the Japan Self-Defense Forces, its limitations have been apparent for some time. Enter the C-2. The original XC-2 prototype in flight with the first production C-2., Japan Ministry of Defense via Wikimedia The medium-range/medium-lift C-2 program began with the Japanese Ministry of Defenseâ€™s request for funding for a C-X airlifter in 1995. In 2001, the Ministry requested proposals from industry for both the C-X and the so-called MPX, the aircraft that became the P-1 maritime patrol aircraft . While industry observers at the time were skeptical, the P-1 and the C-2 aircraft do share some subsystem components. Despite appearing comparatively gargantuan in the video, the Kawasaki C-2 sits somewhere between a C-17 and a C-130 in terms of size and capabilities. In fact, it is probably closest in most regards to the turboprop-powered Airbus A-400M . The C-2’s huge twin engines, General Electric CF6-80C2K1F high-bypass turbofans â€” similar to those on many 747s and 767s, for instance â€” absolutely dwarf the C-1’s JT8D-M-9s, which are a prolific Pratt & Whitney design that were built under license by Mitsubishi. Just in terms of thrust alone, the differences are huge â€” 14,500 lbs of thrust for each engine on the C-1, compared to just shy of 60,000 lbs for each of the C-2’s CF6 engines.Â An impressive lineup of C-1s. , Japan MoD The C-2, which retains short field capabilities like its diminutive predecessor, is something of an anomaly for a military cargo-carrying aircraft of its size. All others use four engines, not two. While this may simplify sustainability and even help with fuel burn, engine-out flexibility does suffer.Â The C-2’s large rear ramp and cargo hold allows it to accommodate outsized cargoes that the C-1 could never carry. This includes materiel such as the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, armored vehicles, or even a Mitsubishi H-60 series helicopterâ€”a Japanese aircraft based on the Sikorsky S-70 aircraft family. A truck being unloaded from a C-2., Ministry of Defense The C-2 allows the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) to rapidly deploy troops and cargo, as well as to participate in humanitarian assistance and other contingenciesâ€”the latter are operations the country has increasingly become more involved in. Japan’s larger international vision for its military is also a factor in the C-2’s requirements. For instance, Japan opened its first permanent overseas military base since World War II in Djibouti a decade ago. A single C-2 also reportedly participated in the humanitarian airlift from Hamid Karzai International Airport in August 2021, an event The War Zone covered in great detail at the time . The cockpit of a C-2, taken in 2017., Oleg Belyakov / Wikimedia The C-2â€™s advantages over the C-1 are massive, really. In fact, while one largely informed the design of the other, they are quite different aircraft. Beyond improved range, increased speed, and a much larger payload â€” roughly up to four times that of the C-1 â€” the C-2 also features a range of modern technologies, including an advanced flight deck and flight control system, auto-airdrop system, self-protection equipment, and an air-to-air refueling capability. As so often happens once an airframe proves itself, the C-2 has been adapted for multiple roles besides hauling cargo. Japan has converted the second prototype to an electronic intelligence-gathering RC-2 versionâ€”a critical asset in an age of rising threats from major regional players. The one-off RC-2 electronic intelligence-gathering aircraft in 2019., Alan Wilson / FLICKR Japan has not been much of a player in the international marketplace when it comes to military aircraft, but the country has decided to offer the C-2 (and the P-1 MPA) for export, challenging competitors such as the Airbus A400M and Ilyushin Il-76, although no foreign sales have been recorded yet. The JASDF plans on buying just 22 C-2s, which is even less than the number of C-1s that were built, which totaled 31.Â While seeing the C-1 and its successor, the C-2, next to one another on the ramp at Kamigahara provided many Twitter users an eye-opening chuckle, it also served as a strong visual demonstration of how far Japanâ€™s military ambitions and capacity have advanced in just a few decades.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 19, 2021",The Army Just Got Its Hands On Its First “Dark Eagle” Hypersonic Missile Launchers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is moving closer toward fielding its first Dark Eagle hypersonic missiles, also known as the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon , with the recent delivery of prototype trailer-mounted launchers, as well as other key components of the complete weapon system. In doing so, the Army has also confirmed that Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State is the home of the first unit intended to be equipped with these weapons, something the service has been very tight-lipped about in the past. Joint Base Lewis-McChord’s public affairs office posted a series of pictures online yesterday showing the arrival of the launchers, but the accompanying metadata says that they were all taken on either Sept. 14 and 15 of this year. A common caption attached to each one of the images says that there will be an official ceremony to mark the formal delivery of these trailer-mounted systems to the 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, tomorrow. This tractor/trailer combination was among the prototype hypersonic hardware to arrive recently at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. , U.S. Army/Spc. Karleshia Gater Though no actual missiles have been delivered to the unit, so far, the launchers and other equipment will allow soldiers to familiarize themselves with various aspects of the LRHW and the general operation of the weapon system. It will also help support the development of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) needed to employ the missile in real-world scenarios. The caption to the images that Joint Base Lewis-McChord released also notes that the prototype LRHW elements now at the base were built under the direction of its Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) and that it includes undisclosed “components” that will allow soldiers to “fully train with the system.” The pictures that were released yesterday show only the launchers, which had not previously been seen, being delivered. These are mounted on modified M870 trailers and will be towed by Oshkosh M983A4 tractor trucks, which are variants of the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). Earlier this year The War Zone reported on the delivery of two empty box-like canisters, identical to the ones that will hold real Dark Eagle missiles in the future, to what was then an undisclosed location. The Army has previously offered other details about the various expected components of its first LRHW battery, as seen in the infographic below. A U.S. Army infographic showing the basic components of the LRHW, as well as a notional firing battery. Some of these components have now been delivered, in prototype form, to the Army at JB Lewis-McChord., U.S. Army “It’s going to be a battery of four launchers, two missiles per for basic load of eight,” Bob Strider, Deputy Director of the Army Hypersonic Project Office, said at the annual Space and Missile Defense Symposium in August. “It’s going to be a Battery Operations Center — that’s our C2 system that is based against an AFATDS, the [Advanced] Field Artillery Tactical Data System …. with a support vehicle.” “This will be a road-mobile system, which is critical, the ability to move around the battlefield,” he added. While we still don’t know the official designation for the initial LRHW unit, the latest photos reveal that at least some of the launchers have been given individual names, including Hyperion . In August, the Army had also revealed that it had given the name Dark Eagle to the forthcoming missiles that these launchers are intended to fire. Soldiers and contractors pose in front of a prototype LRHW launch trailer, named Hyperion., U.S. Army/Spc. Karleshia Gater Back in March, when the Pentagon announced the delivery of the first two inert missile canisters, it was stated that “all additional ground equipment” for the LRHW prototype battery would also be delivered this year, suggesting that components at Joint Base Lewis-McChord may now constitute a complete system, with the exception of the missiles. Regardless of that fact, the prototype hardware delivered so far is intended for training use only. It was previously reported that the Army anticipated tests of its prototype LRHW battery to start in Fiscal Year 2022, which began this October 1. The Army meanwhile plans to complete the fielding of a first operational battery, including live missile rounds, in Fiscal Year 2023. An LRHW launcher trailer arrives at JB Lewis-McChord on a flatbed truck., U.S. Army/Spc. Karleshia Gater U.S. Army/Spc. Karleshia Gater While the Army has previously fielded ballistic missiles capable of hitting hypersonic speeds — generally classed as anything over Mach 5 — the LRHW, once in service, will be the service’s first purpose-built hypersonic weapon. Development of the LRHW has involved the Army and the Navy , with the maritime branch using the same hardware in its Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike (IRCPS) weapon. While the launcher platforms for LRHW and IRCPS are different, the missiles themselves are the same, including a Common Hypersonic Glide Body, or C-HGB, and rocket booster. Video of a joint U.S. Navy and U.S. Army test launch of a C-HGB hypersonic glide body from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai, Hawaii, in March 2020: In its statement on the prototype LRHW delivery, the Army says the weapon, once fielded, will “provide a unique combination of speed, maneuverability, and altitude to defeat time-critical, heavily defended, and high-value targets.” As far as speed is concerned, the Pentagon has previously said that the C-HGB will be capable of reaching a maximum speed of Mach 17. It also said it would be able to strike targets at a distance of at least 1,725 miles . U.S. Army/Spc. Karleshia Gater U.S. Army/Spc. Karleshia Gater The maneuverability mentioned by the Army is another key attribute of new-generation hypersonic missiles, with the C-HGB able to make more unpredictable maneuvers, compared to traditional ballistic missiles, complicating an adversary’s ability to defend against it. The potential game-changing aspects of hypersonic weapons are something that The War Zone has discussed in depth in the past. The LRHW’s hypersonic capabilities are a critical part of the Army’s broader Long Range Precision Fires effort , or LRPF, which it describes as its “number one modernization priority.” Among others, this initiative aims to give artillery units a new long-range and deep-strike capability, including replacing the Army Tactical Missile System ( ATACMS ) now in use. ATACMS is a relatively small ballistic missile with a maximum range of around 190 miles and is set to be directly replaced by the Precision Strike Missile .

Karleshia Gater As The War Zone has examined in the past, hypersonic weapons, in general, are fast becoming seen as an important component of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command’s future warfighting strategies , above all to counter China’s expanding military capabilities in the region. An artist’ conception of an LRHW being fired from its trailer-mounted launcher., Lockheed Martin Earlier this year, the Pentagon submitted a plan to Congress outlining more than $27 billion in proposed spending over the next six years to bolster capabilities across the Pacific region to deter China. Fundamental to this Pacific Deterrence Initiative, or PDI, will be forward-deployed long-range strike capabilities. While these would include ground-based cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles — like LRHW – would be expected to play a central role. The decision to base the first LRHW systems at Joint Base Lewis-McChord also speaks to the importance of this theater, the west coast location allowing the missiles to be rapidly positioned to contribute to future exercises or contingencies in the Pacific, including via the base’s resident C-17 airlifter fleet . Furthermore, the base is also home of the first Multi-Domain Task Force , another concept created with Pacific operations in mind, and which is ultimately intended to include a Strategic Fires Battalion equipped with HIMARS launchers and “mid-range” missiles , as well as LRHW. A graphic depicting the organization of a notional complete Multi-Domain Task Force, which includes a battery equipped with the LRHW, among other things., U.S. Army However, the Army’s plans for fielding and employing LRHW develop, and regardless of where future batteries are deployed, the arrival of the first prototype launchers, and other hardware, at an Army installation is a critical step in the service’s path toward fielding hypersonic missiles.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 9, 2017",The Navy’s Last Conventionally Powered Aircraft Carriers Have Been Sold For Literal Pennies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has finally sold off what remains of the former aircraft carriers USS Kitty Hawk and USS John F. Kennedy for scrap, letting them go for one cent each. The service decommissioned both ships more than a decade ago but had kept them in mothballs as various groups attempted to secure them to turn them into museums, and there were even some brief discussions about returning Kitty Hawk to active duty. The Navy finally struck them from the rolls for good in 2017 and began prepping them to be broken down. News emerged just recently that International Shipbreaking Limited, a subsidiary of EMR Group situated in Brownsville, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico, had secured a deal with the Navy to take the carriers for a total of two cents. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) first announced it was actively looking for a contractor to tow away both ships and break them up last year. The ex- Kitty Hawk seen at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in 2017., Quillc via Wikimedia “I’ve personally inspected her, so I know she’s in good shape for towing,” Chris Green, a senior manager at International Shipbreaking told The Brownsville Herald newspaper, referring to the former Kitty Hawk . In March, the Navy announced it had put that vessel, which it decommissioned in 2009, into dry dock at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Bremerton, Washington, “to remove marine growth from the hull” as part of the process of getting it ready to be scrapped. Work to get the ship ready to leave for Brownsville is expected to begin next week. The timeline for when the ex- John F. Kennedy , which the Navy retired in 2007, will make its final journey is much less certain. “That process can take a short amount of time or it can take up to six months,” Green said. “It just really depends on their schedules and sometimes they’re really swamped. … I’d hate to put a timeline on the JFK right now just because of those questions marks.” Selling these two ships, which cost relatively huge sums of money to build, for literal pennies may seem shocking, but often the Navy is the one paying millions more to contractors to take decommissioned vessels away for scrapping, which can be a very complex affair. For instance, the service is looking at a bill of more than $1.5 billion to dismantle the former Enterprise , its first nuclear-powered supercarrier. The total estimated cost to dispose of the hulk of the ex-USS Bonhomme Richard , a Wasp- class amphibious assault ship that was ravaged by a massive fire last year, was pegged at a more modest $30 million . As is evidenced by the time the former Kitty Hawk spent in dry dock earlier this year, as well as the work that apparently still needs to be done on the ex- John F. Kennedy , the Navy has already incurred some costs in disposing of these carriers. The basic logistics of towing these massive ships to International Shipbreaking’s yard underscore just how complicated the whole process is. The ex- Kitty Hawk cannot be towed through the Panama Canal and, as such, will have to be brought all the way around the southern tip of South America to get from Washington State to the Gulf of Mexico. International Shipbreaking’s Green said that it could take between 10 and 18 weeks, or between around two and a half and four and a half months , to make the trip. The former John F. Kennedy , which is laid up at the Philadelphia Naval Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a shorter voyage ahead of it. It will take years to fully dismantle both ships. Whenever the ships finally do make their way to Brownsville, it will mark something of an end of an era. These were the very last conventionally powered aircraft carriers in Navy service and were the last two in the service’s possession in any condition. The Kitty Hawk , the lead ship in her class, was first commissioned into service in 1961 and received various upgrades over the years. This carrier’s first major combat outing was in support of the Vietnam War, and it went on to take part in many more U.S. military operations, including the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, over the course of its nearly 50-year-long career. The USS Kitty Hawk toward the end of her career., USN The John F. Kennedy was a one-of-a-kind derivative of the Kitty Hawk class design that was originally intended to be nuclear-powered and that first entered service in 1968. The ship did not see service in Vietnam, but it did support a variety of other missions, including the U.S. response to the bombing of Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983 and the first Gulf War in 1991. The carrier and its air wing were called upon to provide combat air patrols after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , and the ship also took part in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan. The Navy set the John F. Kennedy aside for possible conversion into a museum ship after it was decommissioned. Multiple groups attempted to secure the vessel for this purpose , but none of those efforts was successful. The USS John F. Kenndy , in the foreground, among many other ships, in New York City Harbor for the International Naval Review in 1986., USN A number of organizations also attempted to get Kitty Hawk , which had been placed in the service’s inactive reserve fleet , leaving open the possibility it could be called back to active duty, released for some kind of public display . In 2017, the Navy did briefly consider recommissioning the ship, which you can read more about here , before shifting gears and instead striking it from the rolls entirely and paving the way for its scrapping. As it stands now, the service has no conventionally powered carriers, though there continue to be intermittent discussions about potentially acquiring such ships in the future, an ongoing debate that the War Zone has followed closely over the years. The other two ships in the Kitty Hawk class, the Constellation and the America , were disposed of years ago. International Shipbreaking also scrapped the former Constellation , which first arrived at its yard in Brownsville in 2015. The ex- America was deliberately sunk in 2005 in a unique exercise to gather data about potential vulnerabilities of Navy supercarriers, which you can read more about here . All of this also makes it very unlikely that another decommissioned Navy carrier will ever end up as a museum. At present, the service only has plans to acquire nuclear-powered types, which it has deemed categorically unsuitable for conversion into attractions for the general public due to how complex their reactor plants make the decommissioning process. The ex- Enterprise , the Navy’s first nuclear-powered carrier, is slated for dismantlement. , USN What kind of chance anyone may have to see either of these ships up close before they begin being broken down remains to be seen. International Shipbreaking’s Green explained to The Brownsville Herald that they’re are contractually prevented from letting groups tour either carrier. “We had over 1,500 people call wanting to come see [the former USS Constellation ] arrive, and we had planned on doing some type of arrival ceremony and having veterans participate, but the numbers just got too big for our ability to handle,” he said, adding that the company was trying to see if officials in Cameron County, where Brownsville is located, might be able to help put something together. “The carriers are special because they touched so many people’s lives,” he continued. “I’ve heard a whole lot of stories.” It will certainly make the last voyages for these carriers, which served the United States for decades, all the more somber if there is no way for veterans and other members of the public to welcome them into port one last time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2021",Watch An F-35 Drop A B61 Nuclear Bomb In This First-Ever Declassified Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sandia National Laboratories, in cooperation with the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the U.S. Air Force, recently completed a round of flight tests as part of the integration of the new B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb onto the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter . Sandia has also released first-of-its-kind video footage of one of these test sorties, which involved the first-ever release of an inert version of this weapon from an internal bomb bay on a plane flying faster than the speed of sound and that also provides an unprecedented look at the bomb’s rocket spin stabilization system. The press release from Sandia said that the supersonic test had taken place over the Tonopah Test Range on Aug. 25. The range is a secretive site nestled in the northwestern end of the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range and it has been used for various kinds of nuclear weapons testing, as well as other sensitive research and development and test and evaluation activities, over the years. You can see a rare video tour montage of the range in this previous post of ours. The F-35A dropped the test B61-12, which included functional non-nuclear components and simulated nuclear components, from an altitude of 10,500 feet. It took approximately 42 seconds for the bomb to hit the designated target on the range. Check out the video of the test below: “We successfully executed this historic, first-ever F-35A flight test at Tonopah Test Range within the specified delivery criteria,” Brian Adkins, the range manager at the facility, said in a statement. An F-35A drops an inert B61-12 bomb during an earlier flight test., DOD “This was the first test to exercise all systems, including mechanical, electrical, communication and release between the B61-12 and the F-35A,” Steven Samuels, a manager with Sandia’s B61-12 Systems Team, added. “The latest test is a critical piece in the F-35A and B61-12 program.” The test was particularly significant since the F-35A is expected to carry the B61-12 internally, unlike other so-called “ dual-capable ” combat jets able to fly at supersonic speeds, such as the F-15E Strike Eagle , which will also be able to employ this weapon. The Air Force’s existing stealthy B-2 Spirit and the future B-21 Raider bombers will also carry these bombs internally, but fly at subsonic speeds. The red tail of an inert B61-12 is visible inside the bomb bay of this F-35A during an earlier flight test., DOD The video from the test, seen earlier on in this piece, also gives a very good look at the function of the pair of angled rockets in the bomb’s mid-section, which fire after it has been released to give it spin stabilization for greater accuracy. The B61-12 is also the first weapon in this family of nuclear bombs, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature , to have a precision-guidance system in the form of a tail kit that contains an inertial navigation system (INS), similar in some general respects to the ones used on conventional Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs. A screen capture from the video of the F-35A’s supersonic release of the B61-12 in August, showing the bomb’s rocket spin stabilization system in action., Sandia National Laboratories capture There have been other flight tests involving inert B61-12s loaded on F-35As since as least 2019. The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) released photos of some of those initial flight tests in June, before they pulled them offline. The goal is for the full flight test series involving the F-35A to also “conclude with full-weapon systems demonstrations designed to increase confidence the bomb will always work when needed and never under any other circumstances.” It’s not clear when this test program might finally wrap up, but back in 2017, reports had said that the goal was to have the B61-12 integrated onto the F-35A by the end of this year. The Air Force declined to provide an updated timeline to The War Zone in response to a query earlier this year, citing “operational security reasons.” Especially given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it seems unlikely now that the Air Force’s Joint Strike fighters will be certified to carry this weapon before sometime next year, at the earliest. In March, Sandia had also announced that it had demonstrated that the B61-12 was fully-compatible with the F-15E Strike Eagle . It says it did the same with regards to the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber in June. It’s unclear if the Air Force’s nuclear-capable B-52 bombers will ever be certified to carry this weapon. These aircraft presently are not approved to carry any nuclear gravity bombs , owing to their vulnerability to increasingly more capable air defenses, and look set to only carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles in the immediate future. Integration on the F-16C/D Viper is still planned, in part to support NATO nuclear sharing commitments , as well. With Germany now set to buy F/A-18E/Fs to replace its Panavia Tornados , which it, as well as Italy, has used in the dual-capable role, adding the B61-12 to the Super Hornet’s arsenal is now on the agenda, as well. The exact schedule for integrating the B61-12 onto any of these aircraft may be somewhat moot, at least in the near term, given that the Air Force does not expect to receive the first production B61-12s until 2022. The National Nuclear Security Administration, which is responsible for overseeing U.S. nuclear weapons production and the sustainment of the country’s nuclear stockpile, announced in 2019 that its delivery plans for this bomb, as well as upgraded W88 ALT 370 warheads for the Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles, had been significantly delayed after it was discovered that a commercially sourced component did not meet its strict reliably requirements. Sourcing replacements for those parts, each one of which cost just $5, is expected to cost $850 million. This is all on top of previous delays and cost increases with regards to the B61-12, each one of which is set to cost more than its literal weight in gold. Sandia, together with Los Alamos and the Air Force, are clearly making good progress in ensuring that whenever the first B61-12s do enter service, the Air Force’s F-35As will be able to carry them, if the call to do so ever comes.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2021",F-35A Completes Final Inert Drop Test Of New B61-12 Nuclear Bomb,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is making progress toward fully certifying its F-35A stealth fighters for the nuclear strike role , armed with the new B61-12 nuclear bomb . Flight tests of the jet carrying the weapon were recently completed, involving the release of what the service described in a statement as “the most representative B61-12 test asset” from an “operationally representative F-35A.” The service has said in the past that the F-35A could start carrying the bombs operationally before the end of next year. The Full Weapon System Demonstration, the first of its kind for the Joint Strike Fighter in the nuclear strike configuration, involved two Air Force F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variants each dropping a single unarmed B61-12 Joint Test Assemblies (JTAs) over the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. This range is part of the wider Nevada Test and Training Range and has a rich history of nuclear weapons testing, as well as other sensitive research and development and test and evaluation efforts. You can see a rare video tour montage of the range in this previous War Zone story. An F-35A carrying a B61-12 Joint Test Assembly sits on the flight line at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on September 21, 2021. The bomb itself is not visible, but the jet also carries a pair of AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles in its weapons bays. , U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Zachary Rufus Billed as a “graduation test,” the latest effort was led by the 422nd and 59th Test and Evaluation Squadrons stationed at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada. Photos released by the Air Force indicate that the weapons launch trial took place on September 21 this year. “The B61 series weapons are tactical gravity nuclear weapons that can be used on Dual Capable Aircraft [DCA] like the F-15E and F-16C/D,” explained Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Jackson, division chief, Headquarters Air Combat Command Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration. “Having a fifth-generation DCA fighter aircraft with this capability brings an entirely new strategic-level capability that strengthens our nation’s nuclear deterrence mission.” Development of the B61-12 has been ongoing since at least 2011, and the new bomb is technically a refurbishment and consolidation of four existing variants, the B61-3, -4, -7, and -10. The B61-12 is characterized by a new tail assembly that features am Inertial Navigation System (INS) precision-guidance package for much-enhanced accuracy. You can read more about the different members of the long-serving B61 family in this past War Zone feature . According to a statement from the F-35 Joint Program Office, the latest tests involved “high-fidelity, non-nuclear mock B61-12s,” and each weapon was dropped at a different altitude and speed. The actual launch parameters of the tests were not revealed, but we do know that, in the past, at least one F-35A has dropped a test B61-12 at supersonic speed, an event you can read more about here . Video of a test from last year in which an F-35A dropped a B61-12 test round over the Tonopah Test Range: With this latest milestone event, the Air Force has now completed the flight test portion of the nuclear design certification process for the latest B61 series weapon, which involved 10 test drops in total. Now that nuclear design certification has been wound up, the program moves into the nuclear operational certification phase, essentially clearing the aircraft and weapon for frontline service. In the meantime, data gathered during the latest test at Tonopah will be assessed by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, to ensure the B61-12 and the F-35A meet all performance requirements. The red tail of an inert B61-12 is visible inside the bomb bay of this F-35A during an earlier flight test., U.S. Department of Defense The Air Force says that no date has been set for full F-35A nuclear certification, at which point the jet will be determined able to deploy the B61-12 in support of real-world operations. The service does, however, note that the integration process is set to “remain on track for future timelines.” Back in 2017, it was reported that the Air Force had set a goal of between 2020 and 2022 to introduce the B61-12 capability on the F-35A. However, the service has also said it does not expect to receive the first production B61-12s until 2022, meaning that the F-35As will likely have to wait until then, at least. An F-35A takes off to complete the final test exercise of the nuclear design certification process at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on September 21, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Zachary Rufus Airmen from the 926th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron watch as an F-35A pilot assigned to the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron performs pre-flight checks before launch at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on September 21, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Zachary Rufus However, the B61-12 capability will only be realized by F-35A units that are earmarked for the nuclear mission, likely to be spearheaded by the current F-16C/D units deployed in Europe that will continue their DCA mission when they transition to the Lightning II. Adaptations for that mission concern not only the hardware and software changes required on the jet itself to prosecute it, but also the appropriate training of aircrew and maintainers, plus various support and security infrastructure at the relevant bases. An F-35A pilot assigned to the 442nd Test and Evaluation Squadron completes pre-flight checks on the flight line at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on September 21, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Zachary Rufus The nuclear strike role will likely be performed not only by the U.S. Air Force but also by certain F-35A export customers within NATO, which could be provided with access to U.S.-owned nuclear bombs, as is currently the case for Belgium , Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Of these, all but Germany are buying F-35As. Interestingly, the Air Force is also now pitching the nuclear-armed F-35A as a more strategic weapons-delivery platform, as well as being a tactical strike asset. This is likely the result of a few different factors. First, there is the increased accuracy of the B61-12, thanks to its precision-guidance system , combining the aforementioned INS package tail kit and rockets that give the weapon spin stabilization. This guidance also allows the weapon to be launched from dozens of miles away from its target area, increasing survivability. This, paired with the F-35A’s well-reported stealth attributes , allows for better-defended targets to be attacked. It also has a sizeable combat radius for a tactical fighter. Furthermore, unlike its forebears, the B61-12 is designed from the outset for carriage by strategic (bomber) and tactical (fighter) platforms. Speaking to Air Force Magazine , meanwhile , Air Combat Command deputy director for strategic deterrence Lieutenant Colonel Douglas A. Kabel said, “It makes our potential adversaries think more about their game plan before launching it. [The F-35A] can get closer to, further inside a combat area that may otherwise be impossible for non-stealth assets.” Perhaps not coincidentally, the Air Force is already developing tactics that would see the nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bomber work alongside the F-35A in contested airspace — using their respective attributes to defeat the air defenses of a potential peer or near-peer enemy. A screen capture from an earlier video of an F-35A’s supersonic release of the B61-12 in August last year, showing the bomb’s rocket spin stabilization system in action., SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES CAPTURE “The B-2 bomber was the prominent nuclear-capable stealth aircraft,” said Lieutenant Colonel Jackson. “Adding ‘nuclear capable’ to a fifth-gen fighter that already brings several conventional-level capabilities to the table adds strategic-level implication to this jet.” However, the B61-12 won’t just be carried by the F-35A. In June last year, it was announced that the B61-12 had been demonstrated as being fully compatible with the F-15E Strike Eagle , followed by the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber later the same month. Ultimately, the future B-21 Raider bombers will also be armed with the new bombs, and at least a portion of the F-16C/D fleet is also planned to carry them. As part of NATO nuclear sharing commitments , it seems likely that Germany will seek to add the B61-12 to its planned F/A-18E/Fs, as well. Video of the F-15E Strike Eagle performing B61-12 development work over the Tonopah Test Range: But the B61-12 program has already suffered notable delays and cost increases , and there are also budgetary considerations, with the entire program costing around $10 billion, making the average cost per bomb at around $27,500,000. To that figure needs to be added potential cost increases. For example, hundreds of millions were needed to pay for commercial-off-the-shelf capacitors for both the B61-12 and the W88 ALT 370 warheads used in the U.S. Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. These replaced previous items that had cost just $5 apiece. With that in mind, although the process of integrating the B61-12 on the F-35A seems to be progressing well, that’s not to say there won’t be more costs involved in getting this new weapon issued to frontline units.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 30, 2019",These Images Of Aussie C-17s Flying Among Skyscrapers In Brisbane Are The Best We’ve Ever Seen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Like clockwork, every year around September images and videos of military aircraft maneuvering incredibly low through dense urban terrain emerge out of Brisbane, Australia, and hit social media with viral velocity. In years past, the city’s Riverfire spectacle was probably best known in aviation circles for showcasing the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F-111 “Pigs” doing their iconic ‘dump and burn’ maneuver while ripping over the Story Bridge. Today, the F-111s are long gone, but the RAAF is still super active in this event with its Super Hornets and Growlers, and most notably, its hulking C-17 Globemaster III airlifters, taking center stage. These massive cargo jets, in particular, weaving just a couple hundred feet off the ground over the picturesque city is truly a sight to behold. There is really nowhere else in the world where heavy airlifters perform for audiences like this. But after seeing this display for a number of years, and writing about it, as well, the novelty wears off. That is until someone comes along with a new perspective or a piece of media that showcases just how unique the flyover is like never before. Two years ago, this was cockpit footage from inside the display C-17. This year it is the stunning images of Mark Greemantle. To put it bluntly, I have never seen images like his from one of the most heavily photographed aviation displays of the year. Case in point, check out Mark’s images of the C-17 going through its paces for Riverfire 2021: Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle The War Zone asked Mark how he captured these incredible photos and he was kind enough to lay it all out for us: To achieve these images, I have found an ideal perch upon the railing of the 39th floor of Riparian Plaza in Brisbane. For two years pre-COVID, I have hosted the RAAF media teams with me to ensure they can make the most of this vantage point. From the vantage point of Riparian Plaza’s 39th-floor balcony, the jets pass about 30-80ft below the balcony. The balcony, with its 360-degree views, allows for coverage of the air display from above most of the central business district buildings. This year’s images were shot on a Nikon D850 with a Nikkor 200-500mm telephoto lens so the close passes meant I was stuck with close-up crops of the C-17 Globemasters. The general flight path of the display was known from previous years and had only been slightly altered for 2021. What was known for certain was that the pilots from RAAF Amberley Base had flown many hours in the simulator to prepare for the low-level passes (250-300ft above ground level) over the river and bridges. Despite many publications pushing alarmist rhetoric about “dangerous display flights” being too much like 9/11… they hide that the aircraft have a very broad river below their low-level passes and that at no point is any building occupant at any risk of harm. Previous years have included more passes by either 1Sqn RAAF’s F/A-18F Superhornets or 6Sqn’s EA-18G Growlers, as well as the 36Sqn Globemasters, and we’ve also enjoyed displays from Australian Army aviation corps with the MH-90 Taipans and the ARH Tigers buzzing the large number of boats crowding the river ahead of the fireworks displays. Check out some additional images from Mark of Taipan and Tiger helicopters showing off at this year’s Riverfire: Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle Mark Greenmantle A bit more about Mark and how he became so passionate about aviation photography: My work with defense interests began nearly a decade back when I commenced fundraising efforts for verified Veteran organizations in Australia and the US shooting mostly warbirds and pinups in WWII-themed calendars. It grew from calendars to touring with warbird crews to shoot air-to-air work and eventually led me to include a major in aviation management to my degree in counterterrorism and intelligence. Australia has been slow to recommence airshows since COVID, so the RAAF displays for Riverfire have been a small preview of what was normalcy for many of us. A huge thanks to Mark for sharing his amazing images and thoughts with us.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 15, 2024",Computerized Rifle Sights To Be Tested By Navy And Marines For Drone Defense,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is acquiring a number of SMASH 2000 computerized optical sighting systems, which can be used on a variety of small arms. These “smart sights” are designed to help shooters spot targets and then show them the most optimal aiming point to engage, even when they’re moving. The SMASH 2000’s manufacturer, Israeli firm Smart Shooter , has also secured a deal to work with the U.S. Navy to see how this technology could be employed on ships. In both cases, the focus is on exploring new defenses against the growing threat posed by small unmanned aircraft . Starting this fall, Smart Shooter will supply an unspecified number of SMASH 2000s to the Marine Corps Rapid Capabilities Office (MCRCO), which is part of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), for testing and evaluation. A press release from the company did not lay out any specific timeline for the work it will do with the Navy through the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), which will be conducted through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). A CRADA is a novel contracting mechanism that allows elements of the U.S. military to partner with industry and academia on various projects, and typically involves sharing resources in lieu of traditional payment. A promotional shot showing the SMASH 2000 sighting system on a Heckler and Koch HK416-series carbine., Smart Shooter “We are honored to announce that the US Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory and NSWC Crane have chosen our technology to better protect against the ever-growing drone threat at land and sea,” Michal Mor, Smart Shooter’s CEO, said in a statement. “Featuring built-in targeting algorithms that can track and even hit very small drones, SMASH fire control systems put a precision anti-drone capability at the fingertips of its users.” The SMASH 2000 system, Smart Shooter’s flagship product , consists of the core sight unit, which can be attached to various guns via a standard accessory rail, along with components that go into the weapon’s pistol grip and onto its handguard. The company also offers lightweight remotely operated gun turrets that utilize the same technology. Outwardly, the main portion of the sighting system looks very much like an oversized non-magnifying red dot or holographic-type sight. The software-driven system also contains a video camera and laser range finder that allows the shooter to place the crosshairs over a target and mark it with the push of a button. Once “locked on” in this way, SMASH 2000 calculated the optimal point of aim and displays that to the user, even if the target begins to move. Smart Shooter says that the built-in camera, together with the system’s networking capabilities, gives it a secondary reconnaissance and surveillance capability, as well. SMASH 2000 was originally designed primarily to help shooters improve their chances of hitting a target with their first shot, even when tired or stressed. This, in turn, would help improve the effectiveness of individual troops, as well as reduce their vulnerability to enemy forces and potentially help limit collateral damage. However, the potential utility of guns equipped with SMASH 2000s, as well as broader applications of the underlying technology, in defending against small drones has been readily apparent for some time. Last year, pictures emerged showing U.S. personnel assigned to Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR) in Syria training to use M4A1 carbines equipped with these sighting systems in this exact role. In March of this year, Smart Shooter revealed that it was working on a new smart sighting system derived from the SMASH 2000 for the U.S. military as part of the Pentagon’s Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate ‘s (IWTSD) Individual Weapon Overmatch Optic (IWOO) program. U.S. personnel assigned to Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR) train with M4A1 carbines equipped with SMASH 2000 sighting systems in Syria in 2020., U.S. Army Smart Shooter did not say what weapons the Marine Corps might be looking to test the SMASH 2000 on, but the service’s own M4A1 carbines, as well as its M27 Infantry Automatic Rifles , would be immediate potential candidate platforms. The M27 is a variant of the Heckler and Koch HK416 rifle , an AR-15/M16 derivative that differs primarily from many other guns in the series, such as the M4A1, in that it uses a physical gas piston as its core operating mechanism rather than what is known as “direct impingement.” A gun that works via direct impingement siphons off a portion of the propellant gas generated from firing a round and uses it to cycle the internal action. You can read more about the differences between the HK416 and earlier AR-15/M16 types here . A U.S. Marine shoots an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle on the range., USMC AR-15/M16 types in Navy service are likely to be at least among the platforms that NSWC Crane will use to explore the applicability of Smart Shooter’s technology in the maritime domain as part of its CRADA with the company, too. “This collaboration aims to perform joint integration and evaluation of Smart Shooter’s technology with weapons and ammunition currently supporting the U.S. Navy’s mission. With an increased hit probability for small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and increased engagement range, Smart Shooter’s SMASH technology has demonstrated the potential to increase the Navy’s ability to engage sUAS at the individual level — using existing weapons and ammunition in inventory,” according to the firm’s press release. Whatever the exact guns the Marines and Navy may be looking to test Smart Shooter’s systems on, it’s not surprising that both services are interested in this technology as a potential way to bolster their counter-drone capabilities. In recent years, the entire U.S. military has been rushing to expand its defenses against various tiers of unmanned aircraft , which present real threats now to American troops fighting abroad and conducting operations on U.S. soil. U.S. Navy sailors conduct qualification training with M4A1 carbines onboard the Whidbey Island class dock landing ship USS Germantown ., USN “These small- and medium-sized UAS proliferating across the [area of operations] present a new and complex threat to our forces and those of our partners and allies,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East, notably told members of Congress earlier this year. “For the first time since the Korean War, we are operating without complete air superiority.” Reports of small drones flying over or near sensitive U.S. airspace, such as the site occupied by the U.S. Army’s Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense battery on Guam, have only been increasing. The potential risks unmanned systems pose to critical civilian infrastructure and other non-military targets continue to grow, as well. These threats have also been expanding into the maritime domain . It’s hard not to see a series of still-unexplained incidents involving drones swarming U.S. warships off the coast of Southern California back in 2019, which you can read more about in this past War Zone feature , as likely being one specific factor behind the Navy’s new CRADA with Smart Shooter. With all this in mind, Smart Shooter’s SMASH 2000, or other systems derived from its core technology, are clearly of growing interest to the U.S. military, as a whole, as part of efforts to establish new layers of defense against small drones — as well as making its personnel shoot more accurately, overall.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan is back in the business of operating a fixed-wing aircraft carrier, with the first embarkation of short takeoff and vertical-landing F-35B stealth jets from the U.S. Marine Corps on the modified helicopter carrier Izumo . It is the first instance of the country operating fixed-wing aircraft from ships since the end of World War II. The trials are set to kickstart a new era for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, or JMSDF, which has long harbored ambitions to adapt its two 24,000-ton Izumo class helicopter carriers for fixed-wing operations. The Japanese Ministry of Defense announced today that the Marine Corps F-35Bs went aboard the Izumo for the first time yesterday, releasing a number of photos and video of the action, which took place in the waters south of Shikoku. Japan’s Ministry of Defense had previously confirmed that Marine Corps F-35Bs would go aboard the Izumo between October 3 and 7, for a period of trials in the Pacific. These will evaluate the modifications that have been made to the Izumo so far, as part of its transition from a very capable helicopter carrier to a true aircraft carrier, able to support and operate fixed-wing short takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) types. Ahead of these trials, the Izumo arrived at Iwakuni last week. You can read all about the preparation for these trials and Japan’s winding road to regaining a fixed-wing carrier capability in this recent The War Zone article . Check out the F-35Bs in action aboard the Izumo in the video tweet below: 3 OCT, the #JMSDF conducted verification of takeoff and landing of the USMC F-35B to JS #IZUMO .

A VMFA-242 F-35B performs a vertical landing on the deck of the Izumo ., Japanese Ministry of Defense Long term, the warship will need more radical changes to the flight deck, which currently tapers off toward the end, resulting in a trapezoidal shape that reduces the surface area where the jets take off. As we expected, the initial videos of F-35B operations on the Izumo seem to show the jets performing very short takeoffs to address that. Once fully reconfigured, the warship will have a squared-off flight deck, more like that found on the U.S. Navy’s big-deck amphibious assault ships. When work is completed on the Izumo , it will be the turn of her sister vessel, Kaga, to undergo the same changes, although these are planned to be incorporated in just one period of rework and refit. Both ships will also receive various changes below the flight deck, making them better able to handle F-35Bs and their maintenance demands, as well as providing storage for ammunition and aviation fuel.

Tokyo has announced plans to purchase a total of 147 Joint Strike Fighters, of which 42 will be STOVL F-35Bs, and the remainder conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A variants . Work to adapt the Izumo is scheduled for completion in 2026 and, until then, it’s likely we will see Marine Corps F-35Bs return to the Izumo. These will echo the kinds of trials by the Marine Corps that have also proven vital in introducing the STOVL stealth jet aboard the British Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and the Italian Navy carrier Cavour . Japan’s return to operating fixed-wing fighters from its warships has been a long time coming — the last such operations were during the final months of the war in the Pacific in 1945. For most of the years after that, the defensive nature of Japan’s constitution ruled out the possibility of operating a true aircraft carrier. Before long, however, Japan will be capable of launching its own fixed-wing tactical airpower from the sea, which promises to overhaul the capabilities of the JMSDF in the Asia Pacific region, and beyond.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Short takeoff and vertical-landing F-35B stealth jets from the U.S. Marine Corps are poised to go aboard the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, or JMSDF, helicopter carrier Izumo , which has been modified for Joint Strike Fighter operations. The plan is to deploy the Marine Corps jets aboard the warship to prove the concept of fixed-wing operations before Japan begins to introduce its own F-35Bs in the next few years. Japan’s Ministry of Defense announced yesterday that the Marine Corps F-35Bs would go aboard Izumo between October 3 and 7, to conduct shipborne operations in the Pacific. As far as we are aware, this will be the first time that fixed-wing aircraft have operated from a Japanese warship since World War II. The 24,000-ton Izumo has now arrived at Iwakuni, in Yamaguchi prefecture, home of a Marine Corps Air Station , as well as JMSDF and U.S. Navy flying units. A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B from VMFA-121 taxis to the runway at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, where the squadron is permanently stationed., U.S. Marine Corps/Cpl. Aaron Henson The F-35Bs that will go aboard the Izumo will be from MCAS Iwakuni’s 1st Marine Air Wing/Marine Aircraft Group 12, which includes two Lightning II squadrons. Of these, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 ( VMFA-121 ), the “Green Knights,” received its first F-35Bs in November 2012 and declared initial operational capability (IOC) in July 2015, before relocating permanently to Iwakuni in January 2017. The squadron has developed considerable shipborne expertise, since it became the first Lightning II unit to deploy at sea, embarking six F-35Bs aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD-1) in March 2018. F-35Bs from VMFA-121 go aboard USS Wasp for the first time: The “Green Knights” have since been joined at Iwakuni by VMFA-242, the “Bats,” which began their transition to the F-35B at the Japanese base in October 2020. They declared IOC on the new type in September this year. It’s expected that aircraft from VMFA-121 will go aboard the Izumo next week, as the Marine Corps continue their close cooperation with allies that similarly operate, or are in the process of acquiring, short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B variants. In the past, the service has assisted in clearing the type to operate from the British Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and, more recently, the Italian Navy carrier Cavour . While Japan has already selected the F-35B as part of a wider Joint Strike Fighter acquisition program that also includes conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A variants , next week’s deck trials will evaluate the type’s compatibility with the adapted Izumo . Various images of the Izumo after its arrival at Iwakuni yesterday: The warship, lead vessel in a two-ship class, was completed as a helicopter carrier, with provision initially only for the operation of rotary-wing types, including tiltrotors. However, the possibility of operating fixed-wing aircraft was also in mind when Japan originally ordered the two vessels, the country’s largest warships since the end of World War II. Indeed, in 2018, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun quoted JMSDF sources stating the following: “It is only reasonable to design (the Izumo) with the prospect of possible changes of the circumstances in the decades ahead … We viewed that whether the Izumo should be actually refitted could be decided by the government.” This summer, modifications to the Izumo’s flight deck were completed at the Japan Marine United shipyard in Isogo, Yokohama, making the warship capable of supporting F-35Bs. Among the changes required are a heat-resistant flight deck coating, a requirement to withstand the hot exhaust of the F-35B’s thrust-vectoring engine, as well as appropriate deck lighting. The Izumo arrives at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan’s harbor, on September 30, 2021., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Darien Wright These are just the first modifications, however, for what is a longer-term program that is needed to ensure Joint Strike Fighters can be embarked and operated for sustained periods. Further changes will include a remodeled flight deck , with a squared-off rather than a tapering end. Below the flight deck, internal spaces will also be reconfigured to handle F-35Bs for stowage and maintenance, as well as providing storage for ammunition and aviation fuel. Images of the Izumo following completion of the first phase of modifications for fixed-wing operations: There has been some speculation that the Izumo class vessels may gain a “ski-jump” takeoff ramp , as used on the British and Italian F-35B carriers, but this seems to have been deemed superfluous. At the same time, the existing rear elevator and hangar space are apparently already suitable for the movement of F-35Bs. As it is, however, the Izumo seems to offer limited deck length for STOVL operations, thanks to the cropped-off, trapezoidal shape of the deck, suggesting that the Marine Corps F-35Bs, as initially embarked, may have to perform lightly loaded, very short takeoffs. U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Lance Lewis, the Marine Corps Air Station commanding officer, and Captain Kawauchi, commanding officer of Izumo , and others, tour the Izumo at Iwakuni, on September 30, 2021., U.S. Marine Corps/Cpl. Mitchell Austin Finally, the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System, or JPALS, will be integrated . A GPS-based landing system, JPALS guides fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters during the approach and landing phases, and its emergence is already leading to significant changes in the way the U.S. Navy goes about training its naval aviators for carrier operations. Work to adapt the Izumo is scheduled for completion in 2026. The second vessel in the class, Kaga , will also undergo the same modifications, providing the JMSDF with two ships capable of embarking F-35Bs. This is an important consideration to boost operational availability, bearing in mind the normal maintenance and training cycles. A major period of scheduled maintenance takes place roughly every five years. The helicopter carrier Kaga , with SH-60 series rotorcraft on deck., Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Japan’s current Joint Strike Fighter plans call for a purchase of 147 aircraft , of which 42 will be STOVL F-35Bs. So far, eight of the STOVL jets are under contract, with deliveries to Nyutabaru Air Base in Miyazaki prefecture expected to begin in Fiscal Year 2024. Funding for another four jets has also been included under the FY2022 budget request. The 42 F-35Bs are expected to be operated by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, or JASDF, despite their close relationship with the JMSDF and its carriers. Ultimately, it’s possible that U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs will become a more regular presence aboard the two modified Izumo class carriers. This would parallel the arrangement between the Marine Corps and the British Royal Navy, where U.S.-operated F-35Bs are filling in the numbers as the United Kingdom works incrementally toward a planned fleet of 24 carrier-available jets by 2023. With the total number of F-35Bs to be purchased by the United Kingdom in doubt , that arrangement may continue long term. At the same time, it ensures that the Marine Corps can share Joint Strike Fighter experience with their British counterparts. An F-35B from VMFA-211 embarked on the Royal Navy flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth as part of joint exercises between the U.K. Carrier Strike Group and the US Expeditionary Strike Group 7, earlier this year., CROWN COPYRIGHT Similar U.S.-Japan military cooperation has already brought together land-based JASDF F-35As to train alongside the U.S. Navy’s Japan-based amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6) in the western Pacific during “advanced combined operations” last year, drills you can read more about here . USS America conducts integrated air defense operations with Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-35As on October 20, 2020., U.S. NAVY Japan may also seek to gain experience from the Marine Corps of the “Lightning carrier” concept, which involves amphibious assault ships operating more as light aircraft carriers with large numbers of Joint Strike Fighters embarked, something we previously discussed in depth here . That kind of arrangement could lend itself well to the adapted Izumo class, which are broadly similar in concept to the U.S. Navy’s big-deck amphibious assault ships. USS America sailing with 13 F-35Bs on deck, and possibly even more stowed away in the hangar deck, during 2019 operations in the eastern Pacific., U.S. NAVY As well as working alongside the U.S. armed forces, Japan may seek to establish a similar relationship with the United Kingdom, which has an increasingly strategic focus on the Asia Pacific region, and which is rapidly building up its military relationship with Tokyo . Both countries will operate F-35Bs as part of two-vessel carrier fleets and the prospect of British F-35Bs operating from Japanese carriers, and vice-versa, as part of an expanding partnership in the region should not be ruled out. For Japan, in particular, establishing a fixed-wing carrier capability provides a counter to developments in China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, which is fast establishing its own carrier fleet and expanding its amphibious forces. As well as providing an extended defensive umbrella around a JMSDF task force, carrier-based F-35Bs offer the ability to launch standoff anti-ship missiles against an adversary’s vessels, which would be especially relevant to blunt an amphibious assault. Having F-35Bs operating aboard a carrier increases survivability and flexibility during a conflict, removing vulnerable land-based airfields from the equation. As The War Zone has surmised in the past , the F-35B carriers could be useful for establishing a presence near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea and other potential flashpoints, helping project power away from the Japanese home islands. In the past, the defensive nature of Japan’s constitution made the idea of acquiring an aircraft carrier — specifically one capable of launching fixed-wing tactical airpower with offensive capabilities — very unlikely. Indeed, the Izumo class vessels were classified as “helicopter destroyers” for this very reason. However, with the growing threat posed by both China and North Korea in mind, this approach has changed, and, in the future, we can expect to see F-35Bs operating regularly from Japanese aircraft carriers as a powerful symbol of this new military reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 15, 2021",A Record-Setting 56 Chinese Warplanes Flew Into Taiwan’s Air Defense Zone Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China today sent a record number of aircraft into the southwestern corner of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone , or ADIZ. So far today, 56 aircraft have done so, constituting the largest group of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) warplanes to fly through that region in recent months . The latest total included bombers, multirole fighters, and surveillance aircraft and tops the previous daily record of 39 aircraft just two days ago, each being recorded in two waves. In all, the last four days — so far — have seen 149 PLA aircraft enter the ADIZ, including another 16 aircraft operating in the ADIZ yesterday, and 38 last Friday. Elsewhere in the wider region, four flattops from three different countries — Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States — have recently been engaged in joint maneuvers together in waters near the Japanese home islands. According to a statement from Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense, the first wave of PLA aircraft that entered the ADIZ earlier today comprised 12 H-6 bombers , 34 J-16 multirole fighters (Chinese-made derivatives of the Russian Su-30 Flanker ), two Su-30s , two KQ-200 anti-submarine patrol planes , and a pair of KJ-500 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft. A second wave of four J-16s then appeared the same evening. A file photo supplied by the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense showing a People’s Liberation Army Navy Air Force KJ-500H AEW&C aircraft from the 3rd Division at Lingshui., Taiwanese Ministry of Defense These aircraft were operating in the vicinity of the disputed Pratas Island in the South China Sea. In recent years, the Taiwanese-controlled island has been identified as a potential flashpoint in the area, with some observers suggesting Beijing could attempt to capture Pratas as a way to demonstrate progress toward its goal of reunifying Taiwan without sparking a wider conflict. For its part, Taiwan’s government has protested against the recent PLA activity in the ADIZ. “China has been wantonly engaged in military aggression, damaging regional peace,” Su Tseng-chang, the Taiwanese premier, said on Saturday. Yesterday, the U.S. Department of State added its voice of concern after the Chinese activity, with the following statement: “The United States is very concerned by the People’s Republic of China’s provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilizing, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability. We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure, and coercion against Taiwan.” Traditionally, October has seen a spike in political rhetoric between China and Taiwan, both countries marking their National Days in the same month. The People’s Republic of China marked its National Day on Friday, while Taiwan will celebrate its own next Sunday. However, previous years have not seen such a dramatic increase in PLA aerial activity over the Strait. Composition and flight paths of the 52 aircraft within the main wave involved in the October 4 incident., Taiwanese Ministry of Defense As well as larger numbers of PLA aircraft now entering the ADIZ on a more regular basis, these formations increasingly include considerable numbers of fighter jets and bombers, as well as the more familiar maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft. According to the Financial Times , since September last year, China has sent military aircraft into the ADIZ for an average of 20 days each month. A file image of a Chinese J-16 multirole fighter, provided by Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense., Taiwanese Ministry of Defense It is important to note that China has been conducting these kinds of sorties on an almost daily basis since 2020, and the PLA aircraft flew over international waters the entire time during their sorties. On the other hand, the ramped-up Chinese aerial activity is clearly a show of force, and it’s likely also no coincidence that it comes amid large-scale naval maneuvers involving Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other allies. Recent drills in waters near the Japanese island of Okinawa involved the Japanese helicopter carrier Ise , HMS Queen Elizabeth , and the U.S. Navy carriers USS Carl Vinson and Ronald Reagan , plus their escorts, and warships from other countries, representing a significant gathering of naval power. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) announced that the maneuvers, which also involved vessels from Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, took place over the weekend as part of efforts to “realize a Free and Open Indo-Pacific” and involved 17 surface ships. Meanwhile, the British Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has now re-entered the South China Sea, where China has expansive territorial claims , repeating an action that has drawn strong criticism from Beijing in the past. The Royal Navy confirmed via a tweet today that the carrier had passed through the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and Luzon Island of the Philippines. The British carrier and other vessels within Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) also entered the South China Sea in July, while traveling from Singapore to the Philippine Sea. You can read all about that in this previous story . At that time, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of National Defense, Wu Qian, warned the United Kingdom against any actions that sought “to destabilize regional peace,” declaring that “the Chinese Navy will take any necessary actions to countermeasure such behavior.” More recently, another Royal Navy warship passed through the Taiwan Strait. On September 27, the Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond , which had broken away from CSG21, sailed through the strait as part of a voyage from Japan to Vietnam. This was the first time a British warship had transited this sensitive waterway since 2008. As well as the backdrop of these ongoing military exercises in the region, there are diplomatic issues currently at stake that could have also prompted an uptick in PLA aerial activity in the Taiwan Strait. A delegation of French senators is visiting Taiwan from today, in a move that Chinese media has described as “provocative” and a “serious violation of the one-China principle recognized by [the] French government.” While the French Navy has not been involved in the latest multilateral exercises in the region, the response points to the wider tensions between China and Taiwan. Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory and has made repeated threats to invade and seize control of the island by force if necessary, including if the island declares full independence. This rhetoric has been stepped up under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who has referenced long-term plans for “reuniting” China and Taiwan. Earlier this year, Admiral Philip Davidson, at the time the commander of United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), warned that China could invade Taiwan within the next six years. U.S. Navy Admiral Phil Davidson, then-commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, greets aircrews at Kadena Air Base, Japan, during a visit in 2018., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Kristan Campbell China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded today to the activities in the region by the U.S. Navy and its partners, describing U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan as well as ships navigating the Taiwan Strait as “provocative action that harmed U.S-China relations.” “China will take all necessary countermeasures and resolutely crush any ‘Taiwan independence’ plot,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement. The arms sales mentioned by Beijing include the recent award to Boeing of a $220 million contract to supply Taiwan with the Harpoon Coastal Defense System (HCDS). In the past, The War Zone has looked at the strategic implications of Taiwan deploying this highly survivable counter to any potential naval assault by forces from the mainland. For the Taiwanese military, such numbers of aircraft, with this level of frequency, means that monitoring and intercepting them is a considerable burden. So far this month, 149 aircraft have been detected in the ADIZ, compared with 117 for all of September . In this latest incident, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense issued its standard response, noting that “airborne alert sorties had been tasked, radio warnings issues, and air defense missile systems deployed to monitor the activity.” With large quantities of PLA aircraft reported in the ADIZ for four days in a row now, there is little to suggest that similar numbers won’t be sustained, or the situation further escalated. More generally, however, the increasingly routine sorties by the PLA are indicative of a willingness to conduct maneuvers that not only draw strong criticism from Taiwan but also the wider international community, while still conforming to gray-zone activity — demonstrating military power but remaining below the threshold for an act of war. Increasingly, too, Taiwan seems to be highlighting that Beijing no longer seems to be making efforts to hide the fact that these actions also serve to intimidate. In a tweet on Saturday, the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it found it “strange the PRC doesn’t bother faking excuses anymore.” As long as the PLA keeps up that approach in the Taiwan Strait, and within the wider South China Sea, we are also likely to see more concerted efforts by Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other allies to conduct joint maneuvers as well as “freedom of navigation” exercises in the region, which, in turn, are almost guaranteed to provoke more complaints from Beijing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 16, 2021",Russia Says It Has Test Fired Hypersonic Cruise Missiles From A Submarine For The First Time (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia says it has successfully test-launched the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile from a submarine for the first time. The Russian Navy’s nuclear-powered Yasen class submarine Severodvinsk , an advanced and extremely quiet design that American officials have said is “on par” with types in U.S. Navy service, reportedly launched one of these fast-flying missiles while sailing on the surface and another while submerged. Both launches took place on October 4, 2021, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The ministry did not provide details about Severodvinsk ‘s test launch while running on the surface but did include some details about the one the submarine conducted while submerged. The official statement said the second test launch was conducted while the boat was in the White Sea at a depth of just over 130 feet and the missile hit a target in the neighboring Barents Sea. No information was provided as to the total distance the Zircons flew in either test launch, or about their peak speed or overall performance. The Russian Ministry of Defense released a video, seen above, that it said showed the test launch from the surfaced Severodvinsk. TV Zvezda , the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television channel, also aired that clip, as seen below, along with others, including submerged missile launches from submarines, but it’s unclear if any of the other footage is from these reported tests today. When Russian officials announced what they said was the first successful launch of a Zircon from a ship, involving the Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov , experts and observers questioned whether an accompanying video released at that time showed this new weapon or an older one, such as the Oniks supersonic anti-ship cruise missile or a member of the Kalibr subsonic cruise missile family . The Russian Ministry of Defense says that the video below shows the first launch of a Zircon missile from a ship, the Project 22350 frigate Admiral Gorshkov . By the Russian government’s own admission, the development of Zircon has been fraught with technical issues and delays. The actual maturity and capabilities of the weapon, a clear complete view of which has not been publicly released to date, is unclear. In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin had indicated the missile, which may have anti-ship and land-attack capabilities, would be able to reach a top speed of Mach 9 and have a range of around 620 miles. The Russian Ministry of Defense said that the missile fired from Admiral Gorshkov last year hit a speed of “ more than Mach 8 ” and flew 280 miles. In August, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchk said trials of the Zircon missile would be finished by the end of this year. It’s also worth noting that, in 2019, Krivoruchk identified the Project 949A Oscar II class submarine Irkutsk , which is not expected to return to the fleet from a major overhaul until next year, and the Project 1155 Udaloy class destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov as being among the first vessels expected to carry Zircon missiles operationally. President Putin had previously announced the weapons would be part of the arsenal available to the Russian Navy’s Project 22350 frigates. In principle, any Russian ship or submarine fitted or refitted with a variant of the new “universal” 3S14 vertical launch system should be able to fire Zircon, among other missiles. If the Russian Navy has indeed successfully test-fired Zircons from the Severodvinsk, and the weapon is finally making real progress in its development, this could be a combination that would be of particular concern to the United States, as well as its NATO allies. The Severodvinsk is set to be a one-of-a-kind boat, but the Kremlin is in the process of acquiring a fleet of subvariants, known as the Yasen-M class , the first of which was commissioned into service earlier this year. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UEzgQ26W4hE The Yasen-M s are smaller than Severodvinsk , but also reportedly have various improvements, including changes that further reduce their acoustic signature, making them harder to detect and track. The original Yasen design, also known as Project 885, was already understood to be very quiet and otherwise advanced compared to existing Russian submarines. You can read more about the Yasen and Yasen-M here . Back in 2019, the state-run Russia-1 television channel did air a segment in which newscaster Dmitry Kiselyov bombastically claimed that submarines carrying Zircon missiles could put targets along the East and West Coasts of the United States at risk during a potential major conflict between the two countries. The segment bizarrely identified a number of former U.S. military installations that have been closed for years, including Fort Ritchie in Maryland and Fort McClellan in California, as among the potential targets for these weapons. It also specifically mentioned the Jim Creek Naval Radio Station, an obscure naval facility used to send very low-frequency transmissions to U.S. Navy submarines in the Pacific. It is important to note that Zircon is expected to have a shorter overall range than many members of the existing Kalibr series, including variants capable of carrying nuclear warheads. At the same time, U.S. officials have acknowledged that the Yasen and Yasen-M class submarines do present new challenges to the security of the homeland, concerns that would only be magnified by the integration of hypersonic cruise missiles into their arsenals. “Russia just fielded their second Sev [ Severodvinsk ] class, which is on par with ours,” U.S. Air Force General Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told members of Congress earlier this year. “Within a five-year period, they’ll have eight to nine of those submarines, which will be a persistent proximate threat off of our east and west coasts that we haven’t had ever in the past.” Kazan , Russia’s first Yasen-M class submarine to enter service., Russian MoD American officials have also previously cited how Kalibr missiles already allow the Russian Navy to hold friendly capitals , among other targets , in Europe at risk, especially when launched from submarines that may not even have to leave port to carry out their strikes. Zircon, even with its shorter range, would again add a new dimension to the complete threat picture in that region. The United States, along with other countries, has been warning in recent years of increasing competition with Russia, and the potential for conflict, as result, in other areas, as well. This includes in the Arctic and the Pacific , where any future high-end fight would have a major maritime focus and where Zircon could have a significant impact on operations. The real threat Zircon presents when fired from any platform, of course, depends on the actual capabilities of the weapon and how much progress the Russians have truly made in its development in the past few years. How close the Russian Navy might be to getting any substantial quantity of these weapons is unclear, as well, with Russian defense procurement plans often being upended by budgetary concerns and other issues . Hypersonic air-breathing vehicles are notoriously complex systems that have proven challenging for various countries, including the United States , to develop even on an experimental basis in the past. A briefing that individuals from Boeing presented to the Military Affairs Committee of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce in Abilene, Texas, last month indicated that Russia was closest to fielding an operational air-breathing hypersonic weapon, but it’s unclear what information this assessment was based on. All told, it remains to be seen whether the Russian government will offer harder evidence to support its statements about Zircon’s design and performance as the end of the year, by which point the weapon’s official test phase is supposed to have wrapped up, draws closer. Updated 3:55 PM EST: The Russian Ministry of Defense has now released an extremely brief video clip that appears to be of the submerged test launch.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 18, 2021",Satellite Imagery Contradicts Reports Of Foreign Aircraft At Bagram Air Base In Afghanistan (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last 48 hours, there have been growing rumors and even media reports that Bagram Air Base , once the stronghold of America’s warfighting capability in Afghanistan, has come alive with mysterious aircraft arriving there overnight. In fact, rumors and claims on social media, which have ranged from the base’s lighting being activated to aircraft being heard landing there, have made it to widely read media outlets. For instance, the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail newspaper, although not known for its accuracy on these matters, ran this story titled: ‘Military’ planes are spotted landing at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan after it was claimed China is ‘considering’ sending soldiers to ex US airbase to strengthen ties with Taliban While that headline does capture the rumor mill pretty carefully, based on satellite imagery The War Zone has reviewed of the base, it does not appear accurate. In fact, in our comparative analysis of Planet Scope imagery from Planet Labs, with one image as recent as today, October 3, 2021, there appears to be nothing new of any significance at the airfield and no transport aircraft of any type on its sprawling ramps. Our review included multiple images from recent days, as well. That is not to say aircraft couldn’t have come and gone between when the images were taken or that an aircraft wasn’t shoved into a hangar. That is entirely possible, although the size of the aircraft would have to be limited. But some sort of substantial operation would likely have multiple aircraft on the ground there. We have ordered a high-resolution image and are awaiting the completion of that tasking so that we can review it. Maybe more information will turn up in that image. It’s also worth noting, there are some chronically confusing details in satellite imagery of Bagram Air Base. These include silhouettes of what appear to be tactical aircraft (F-15s and F-16s) painted on the ground in aircraft revetments on the southeastern side of the field. They are few in number and randomly placed. As such, we often get people sending us alerts that they have seen fighters deployed to Bagram Air Base in satellite imagery. This is simply not the case. Making things stranger, these silhouettes appear to have been painted in recent years and are not relics of prior Taliban rule or Soviet occupation or anything like that. A satellite image taken of Bagram on September 3, 2021, two months after the U.S. abandoned the base. Notice the painted silhouettes of F-16s and F-15s in the revetments. , PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The idea that China could have a major presence in Afghanistan following the Taliban’s return to power and America’s retreat is nothing new, either. Nor is the thought that Bagram Air Base could be used as a hub for Beijing’s interests in the country, but there is no indication that this will definitely be the case, let alone that it is already occurring. For their part, Chinese authorities have denied that they have been negotiating with the Taliban over access to the facility. Additional rumors have swirled that Pakistan may move into Bagram as part of a stabilization force. Once again, there is no hard evidence to support this claim, but it is Afghanistan under very shaky Taliban rule we are talking about, so anything is possible at this point. We also must note that the U.S. famously cut the power from Bagram Air Base and left in the middle of the night back in July. This was a remarkably puzzling move to some of us at the time, but it has become extremely controversial in retrospect after the chaotic and deadly U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan without the help of the highly fortified base, which is located just a couple dozen miles north of Kabul. That being said, eventually, the Taliban would want to get the field up and running even for their own limited use. So restoring airfield lighting would be part of that process. This could be the explanation for what some claim to have been the airfield being lit up during the evening recently. So, while we cannot say definitively that nothing has flown in or out of the now Taliban-controlled Bagram Air Base, the satellite imagery currently available does not support such a claim. This could change once we receive additional high-resolution imagery, but this is where it sits at this time. UPDATE: We have reviewed satellite imagery for October 4th and there are still no signs of any new aircraft being present or major developments at the base.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 7, 2020",Satellite Images Show Massive Armada Of Idle Cargo Ships Waiting To Dock In Long Beach,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The massive backlog of cargo ships stacking up off the port of Long Beach, California, is making headlines . It’s a complicated situation, with multiple factors contributing to the unprecedented situation, including labor shortages at the docks, growing ship sizes, and COVID-safety measures slowing down the processing of each ship’s cargo, as well as a big uptick in incoming cargo, among others. Well over 60 ships are awaiting their turn to offload and the massive delay there, as well as at other U.S. ports, is impacting an already rickety supply chain that has been battered by the logistical fits and starts of the pandemic. The best way to understand just how bad the problem has become is visually. With this in mind, we obtained recent satellite imagery of the area. The image at the top of this post was taken using satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) , with each big ship showing up as a bright glimmer among the black backdrop of the ocean. Here is an even wider angle: Sentinel Hub/Copernicus We also obtained optical satellite imagery from Planet Labs that was taken on September 29, 2021: PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION For comparison, this was taken just one year earlier, on September 24, 2020: PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION As you can see, the difference is absolutely massive, and these are just the ships anchored close-in. Finally, we have a shot of what Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder data shows off Long Beach, and it is remarkable to behold: Vesselfinder.com As you can see in the wider shot below, there are dozens more cargo ships holding farther off the coast, near Santa Catalina or to the north of it. In all, we count roughly 80 cargo ships that appear to be sitting idle. Vesselfinder.com With shipping at California’s biggest port up nearly by a third compared to a year ago and ongoing complications due to COVID-19, delays in cargo transfers have been present throughout the year, but they have been elevated to a new high for the fall shipping season. Many of the goods that get shipped during this time of year are meant to stock retail outlets’ shelves during the holiday season, for instance. Delays in that numbered days or weeks have quickly turned into many weeks or even months as a result. Now major logistics companies are looking for any open port on the west coast to redirect their cargoes, even if it is extremely inconvenient and may shatter the established shipping price model. Of course, all these impacts tend to snowball and lead to even more delays and ballooning shipping costs down the line. It’s also worth noting that this was an incredibly busy weekend for the area in general, with the massive Huntington Beach Air Show in the mix. This is a remote air show with acts flying over the surf and throngs of people watching from the beach. It turned out that this big event was cut short, with Sunday’s show being canceled due to an oil spill in the immediate show area, which is located right by where a gaggle of cargo ships is anchored. A satellite image of the Huntington Beach Air Show from Saturday, October 2, 2021. , PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The spill, which was initially reported as being nearly six miles long and 13 square miles in area, was very close to some of California’s most popular beaches, which had to be closed. The spill was the result of a leak from an offshore oil platform named Elly. The platform works to process crude oil from two other platforms nearby that are tapped into the Beta oilfield. Globs of oil have already started to show up on Huntington Beach and in nearby wetlands. The spill is estimated to be 126,000 gallons and a major containment operation is now underway. While some measures are being put into place that may help the situation, there are no clear indications that this logjam of cargo ships will be alleviated anytime soon. In fact, it may grow further before it eventually subsides. It’s yet another maritime reminder of the sometimes bizarre reality the post-COVID-19 world faces and of the real economic impacts that continue to reverberate from the global crisis.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing announced Friday that it has reactivated the 495th Fighter Squadron, known as the “Valkyries,” today, at the symbolically specific time of “exactly 8:49 and 50 seconds.” The unit will be the first U.S. Air Force F-35A squadron in Europe, or anywhere outside the U.S., really. Its activation, which The War Zone wrote about when it was first planned last year, was timed to coincide with its designation as a fighter squadron 30 years ago today. The squadron’s inventory will eventually consist of 27 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, according to the Air Force. RAF Lakenheath , located about 70 miles northeast of London, will receive the squadron’s aircraft when they begin to arrive later this year. The base is home to the squadron’s parent unit, the 48th Fighter Wing, which includes the F-15E Strike Eagles of 492nd Fighter Squadron “Madhatters” and the 494th Fighter Squadron “Panthers,” as well as F-15C/Ds belonging to the 493rd Fighter Squadron “Grim Reapers.” Retired U.S. Air Force Col. James “Rusty” Russell, previous 495th Fighter Squadron commander, prepares to unfurl the guidon during the squadron’s reactivation at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, October 1, 2021., U.S. Air Force / Airman 1st Class Cedrique Oldaker The commander of the newly reactivated 495th is Lt. Col. Ian D. McLaughlin. In a statement from U.S. Air Forces Europe, Lt. Col. MacGlaughlin said, “Today is an exciting day. There has been a great deal of work done to get us this far, but there’s a lot more that needs to be done prior to getting jets this winter. The 495th has a proud history and we’re excited to take the guidon forward to start building the foundation for first USAF F-35As stationed in Europe.” Last month, Breaking Defense reported that Gen. Tod D. Wolters, Commander, U.S. European Command and NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, outlined a plan for NATO to have some 450 F-35s based at 12 locations in Europe. Breaking Defense listed the bases and dates as: United Kingdom (RAF Marham and RAF Lakenheath starting in 2021) Netherlands (Volkel, in 2022 and Leeuwarden TBD) Denmark (Skrydstrup, in 2023) Italy (Amendola and Ghedi in 2022) Norway (Ørland and Evenes in 2022) Belgium (Florennes in 2025 and Kleine-Brogel in 2027) Poland (Łask in 2026, Świdwin TBD) Though this will be the first permanent basing of USAF F-35As to Europe, it will by no means be the first time the type has operated there in USAF markings. As we noted at the time , the Air Force’s first operational deployment of the aircraft to Europe came in 2017. The Air Force’s F-35 community saw its first combat in the Middle East in 2019, when The War Zone ‘s Joe Trevithick reported : “An unspecified number of F-35As touched down at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates … on April 15, 2019,” before launching their first airstrikes on April 30. F-35A Lightning II aircraft assigned to the 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, land at RAF Lakenheath, England, April 15, 2017., U.S. Air Force / Tech. Sgt. Matthew Plew Earlier this year, the Air Force formally announced its decision on a new name for the 495th Fighter Squadron. Before its late-1991 deactivation, the squadron flew F-111 Aardvarks, a Cold War-era swing-wing fighter-bomber whose flight characteristics we wrote about in 2016. But the nickname the squadron carried then — “The Thundervarks” — clearly wasn’t suitable for a unit that now flies the stealthy 5th-generation multirole F-35. In December 2020, the 48th FW opened a vote on five possible names — Archangels, Sabres, Sentinels, and Swordsmen, and Valkyries — before announcing in February 2021 that Valkyries had won. In Norse mythology, Valkyries — Old Norse for “choosers of the slain” — were servants of Odin who determined who lived and died in battle. At the time of the name’s selection, Lt. Col. McGlaughlin said , “‘Valkyries’ epitomizes the force’s move toward more inclusivity and equally represents the fifth-generation stealth fighter’s air superiority … Like the Valkyries themselves, we’ll be vital to determining the fate of our adversaries in the battlespace.” The squadron’s retained its motto — “Mala Ipsa Nova,” or “Bad news itself” — suggesting the 495th is serious about living up to its new moniker. Although we are not certain if this is the final plan at this time, it was previously indicated that once the second F-35A squadron is fully established at the RAF Lakenheath, F-15C/D operations will end. On F-15C and two F-15Es from RAF Lakenheath in their special commemorative paint refuel from a KC-135., USAF At this time, it appears that the 493rd FS will transition from the Eagle to the Lightning II, with two squadrons of F-35As serving alongside two squadrons of F-15Es. Together, the units would represent an incredibly potent forward-based air combat force. RAF Lakenheath’s squadrons are some of the most heavily tasked in the entire force already. With the addition of the F-35, as well as upgraded F-15Es present, it will only be more so.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 14, 2021",The Story Behind The Modified Falcon Business Jets That Bring America’s Fallen Heroes Home,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For airplane spotters, it’s always exciting to see a rare plane in a special paint job appear at your hometown airport. But for one cadre of very special aircraft, their arrival comes with a far more solemn realization. The aircraft I am referring to are a handful of modified Falcon 20 business jets operated by a prolific family-owned charter and aviation services company located on Willow Run Airport, in Ypsilanti, Michigan— Kalitta Charters . Over the last decade and a half, these aircraft and their dedicated flight crews have been exclusively tasked with one of the most challenging but critical aviation missions in the country — one that comes with an immense emotional toll — the dignified transfer of America’s fallen heroes. After 20 years of perpetual war abroad, Americans have become all-too-accustomed to seeing images of flag-draped coffins being offloaded from military transport aircraft at Dover Air Force Base. But what most don’t see is what comes next — how the remains of those service people actually make it to their families and friends, who await their return in emotionally shattered states in small towns and cities scattered around the country. That is where Kalitta’s dedicated crews and their decades-old Falcon jets come in to play. The remains of Pfc. Tyler Iubelt are lowered from a plane during his dignified transfer ceremony on November 21, 2016, at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. Iubelt passed away on November 12 while deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan., U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Clayton Lenhardt I reached out to Kalitta to see if the company would be willing to give us a firsthand perspective of these extremely challenging operations, including background on the aircraft that supports it and on how the crews have been able to cope doing it for all these years. Berry Birurakis, the General Manager of Kalitta Charters, was kind enough to answer our request. Birurakis noted in our correspondence that he “personally flew some of these missions and they were, psychologically, the most difficult missions I ever flew.” He also brought in Steve Green, who had managed the Dignified Transfer mission for the company since its inception up until recently retiring, to best answer all our questions. Here is our exchange: When did Kalitta get involved with this mission? How did it happen? The RFP for the mission was issued in October 2006. The start date for the bridge contract was January 1, 2007. Kalitta had a very short window to retrofit five Falcon 20s (four deployed and one spare) and to design and build five MHE (Materiel Handling Equipment) units. In mid-November 2006, Kalitta was awarded the initial bridge contract to commence on January 1, 2007, and continue through July 2007. In an unprecedented move, Kalitta Maintenance began working around the clock, seven days per week, up until the morning of December 31, 2006. On that morning, all four Falcons departed YIP (Ypsilanti, MI) and flew to Dover AFB in Delaware to stage. The next day, January 1, 2007 (day one of the mission), all four aircraft left Dover on “Dignified Transfer” missions. One of Kalitta Charter’s Falcon 20s in the hangar at Dover AFB with its custom MHE for the Dignified Transfer Mission., Kalitta Charters Why are private charter aircraft used for the Dignified Transfer mission? Prior to using the Falcons, most caskets were transported using commercial airliners flying into large commercial airports. There was a lack of MHE designed specifically for the task. Caskets were seen by veterans groups being handled with forklifts, belt loaders, and baggage carts in what was considered an undignified manner. DoD then issued an RFP (Request For Proposal) to the air charter community to find a more dignified way of transporting our fallen heroes. Kalitta Charters has decades of experience in retrofitting aircraft and MHE for specific mission requirements and accepted the challenge of complying with all mission requirements. The Falcon was obviously the right aircraft, and Kalitta’s engineering group developed MHE that could be carried aboard the aircraft. The Falcon 20 requires less runway for takeoff and landing than commercial airliners which opened up hundreds of additional destination airports. In many cases, the Falcon was able to land at the hometown airport of a fallen hero versus landing at a large commercial airport that could be over 100 miles away. Although the cost of operating the Falcon is higher than that of using commercial aircraft, it is thousands less per mission than any U.S. Air Force platform. The advantages of getting into small airports, carrying mission-specific MHE aboard the aircraft, and crews trained in conducting “Reverse Dignified Transfers” at the destination airport are but a few factors in using charter aircraft. A U.S. Navy carry team transfers the remains of Navy Capt. Michael Scott Speicher at Dover Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force Photo/Roland Balik Kalitta Charters always had backup aircraft on standby. On extremely rare occasions, the backup aircraft was flown immediately to continue the mission if a maintenance issue grounded the primary aircraft. This was not the case with commercial airliners, who would cancel a flight with no other means of continuing the mission. In those cases, the commercial airliners would simply state that the flight was canceled, and they would deliver the casket the next day. That scenario was totally unacceptable, when the family and typically a large contingent of sympathizers were gathering at the destination airport. When such cancellations occurred, the DoD would dispatch a Kalitta Falcon to continue the mission. There are myriad other advantages to using the Falcons, but these are the primary ones that come to mind. What was needed in terms of hardware and personnel to support the mission? The Falcon 20 is used because it is the ideal size to transport up to 2 caskets at a time and all of the equipment necessary for the Dignified Transfer and Reverse Dignified Transfer of the fallen heroes. The actual aircraft were already freight-configured and needed no real modifications to fly the missions. All we really had to do was design the system to allow for loading and unloading the fallen heroes in a dignified manner. Some of the aircraft are former FedEx aircraft. Others started life as passenger aircraft that were later modified to transport cargo. The cargo transportation modification consisted of removing all of the interior behind the cockpit, reinforcing the floor, placing a protective liner on the walls and ceiling, removing the passenger door, and cutting a large part of the left side forward cabin wall out and putting a cargo door there. National Guard photo by Master Sgt. Kurt Skoglund These are older airplanes. We have an awesome team of maintenance specialists that do a great job of keeping these planes going. Very rarely do we experience a delay for mechanical reasons and, to date, we have never had a mission failure for any reason. How many Dignified Transfer missions has Kalitta flown? We have flown more than 2,600 of these missions. Some of these missions actually carried two fallen heroes. Can you give us an idea of how one of these operations is executed? Our dispatch gets a call from the Dover AFB Mortuary Affairs Office when a fallen hero is to be transported. We are advised of where the family would like the fallen hero to end up and the date and time they want the plane to arrive. Our dispatch finds the nearest suitable airport and plans the departure from Dover to allow for the arrival at the desired time. On the day of the flight, the airplane is prepared, and the Dignified Transfer ceremony is performed to load the casket into the airplane. The fallen hero is always accompanied by an escort, usually from the fallen hero’s unit. There are only two seats in the back of the plane. If we are only moving one fallen hero we can (and have) moved a family member. The honor guard coordination is all done by the DoD. The honor guard at Dover is well-versed in the Dignified Transfer process. When we first put this program together we set up a “simulated” mission that the DoD filmed. We were told that the honor guard at the drop-off location is given access to the video to allow them to prep for the arrival and the Reverse Dignified Transfer. The airplane departs a little early to allow for the possibility of unforecast winds and/or air traffic control delays. As the plane nears its destination, the crew adjusts its speed to allow them to arrive as close to the scheduled time as possible. Once the plane lands, the crew prepares for and conducts the Reverse Dignified Transfer ceremony. The human toll has to be an issue. How have Kalitta aircrews been impacted by such a solemn but honorable mission? Interesting question. As the project manager for the mission, I thought we had considered every possible contingency that might affect our performance to a “zero-fail” standard. As NASA likes to say, “failure is not an option.” On day one, I watched the Dignified Transfers on the ramp at Dover. I watched all four aircraft depart within minutes of each other for various destinations and my own emotions were inevitable. It was then that I became acutely aware of what the crews were going to face at the destination airport. That awareness was confirmed hours later when the first Falcon arrived back at Dover. An honor guard escort carries the casket of National Guardsman SPC Isaac Johnson., US Army The Captain of that Falcon was our chief pilot, Bob Newell. Bob climbed down the ladder and began the post-flight inspection of his aircraft. When he finished, I asked how things went at the destination. Without making eye contact, Bob’s exact words were: “Do we have to talk about this right now?” I was there for the return of the other three aircraft, but I did not ask that question of the crews. Their silence told me all I needed to know. Early the next morning, I went to the Charles Carson Mortuary on the base to speak to the Chaplain, Major Sparks. I told him that we all—flight crews, maintenance crews, and myself—had encountered emotions on the previous day that were unanticipated and difficult to deal with. Chaplain Sparks understood perfectly. It was his job and that of a clinical psychologist to assist USAF and civilian personnel who were new to mortuary affairs at the base. He advised that there were many personnel who asked to transfer out after one day because of the emotional trauma they had experienced. As we did not have any flights going out that second day, he asked me to have all Kalitta personnel report an anteroom at the mortuary at 1:00 PM. At that time, eight pilots, two maintenance personnel, and myself were introduced to Major Sparks and the psychologist. They took us through the introduction to Mortuary Affairs the same as if we were newly assigned USAF personnel. We spent about two hours with those guys and we all came away with a better understanding of what we had gotten ourselves into. What I took away from that meeting was that everyone deals with it differently … but deal with it you must, because you will face it again tomorrow. Kalitta was fortunate to have several former military and National Guardsmen on staff in both the flight and maintenance departments to assist our civilian personnel in understanding the thought processes involving the mission. The company realizes that this is the most important mission that has ever been undertaken at Kalitta Charters and has proudly carried it out to a “zero-fail” standard from January 1st, 2007, to today. Where does the mission stand now that both wars have concluded, at least officially? The contract started out with four airplanes being based at Dover AFB. Now that things have wound down we only have one airplane actually based at Dover and another on standby at our home base in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in case there is a need for two aircraft on the same day.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 12, 2021",The First Littoral Combat Ship Has Been Decommissioned After Just 13 Years Of Service (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The axe has finally fallen on the first of the U.S. Navy’s problematic Littoral Combat Ships , with the decommissioning of the USS Freedom (LCS-1) after a less-than-stellar career lasting just 13 years, during which it was mainly used as a test and training vessel. The removal of the Freedom from the fleet continues a process of retiring these warships, which begun with the former USS Independence (LCS-2) being decommissioned on July 31, and plans are meanwhile afoot to potentially deactivate another three Freedom- class ships—and one Independence- class vessel—by March next year. The decommissioning ceremony for Freedom , the lead ship of its class, took place yesterday at Naval Base San Diego, California. COVID-19 restrictions meant it was a closed-doors event, but it seems possible the fanfare surrounding the decommissioning would have been muted in any case, with both LCS classes having suffered a catalog of problems and the service finally having run out of patience with at least a portion of the fleet. Capt. Larry Repass, USN, commanding officer of the USS Freedom delivers remarks during the decommissioning ceremony on September 29., U.S. Navy/MC2 Vance Hand Nevertheless, retired Rear Admiral Donald Gabrielson, the former commander of U.S. Naval Forces, Southern Command/Commander, U.S. Fourth Fleet — and the commanding officer of the Freedom ’s 2008 commissioning crew — highlighted the warship’s achievements: “I have never in my life seen or served alongside a more capable, dedicated, devoted, talented, and inspiring group of people than the sailors I served alongside with LCS and what I have watched in every day since,” said Gabrielson. “As we acknowledge this bittersweet moment, I hope we’ll all remember that this ship was a vehicle to learn and innovate by doing and to make real progress in a short amount of time, and that doesn’t happen with other ship concepts.” At the time of its decommissioning, the Freedom had a crew of nine officers and 41 enlisted sailors. Built in Marinette, Wisconsin, by Fincantieri Marinette Marine, the warship had originally been commissioned in November 2008. Operational limitations meant that Freedom deployed only once in its career, otherwise being primarily engaged in test and training duties. The first two examples of each subclass were completed to different standards than the subsequent examples, further reducing Freedom ‘s operational relevance. According to Navy officials , it would have cost another $2.5 billion to make the first four ships —two from each class — combat-ready. That’s roughly the cost of buying four brand-new LCSs. “The decommissioning of LCS-1 supports department-wide business process reform initiatives to free up time, resources, and manpower in support of increased lethality,” the Navy wrote in an official statement . “The LCS remains a fast, agile, and networked surface combatant, designed to operate in near-shore environments, while capable of open-ocean tasking and winning against 21st-century coastal threats.” Despite that positive spin, the utility of the LCS remains hampered by its controversial mission modules , which were originally designed to be switched in and out of the hulls rapidly while in port, before the idea was abandoned, leaving each ship with a single module to be installed. As it stands, only the anti-surface warfare version of these modules is fitted on some of the hulls, with the anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasures modules not yet available. Former Rear Admiral John Neagley, Program Executive Officer for Unmanned and Small Combatants, poses with sailors from the USS Forth Worth (LCS-3) at a test event for the Dual-mode Array Transmitter (DART) Mission System and ASW Mission Package., U.S. Navy The Navy’s statement on the decommissioning of USS Freedom alludes to the costs that will be saved as a result, reflecting the higher-than-anticipated expenses involved in operating these warships. Indeed, it’s been reported in the past that the LCS is almost as expensive to run as the far more capable Arleigh Burke- class guided-missile destroyer. At the same time, problems with the propulsion systems on the Freedom class have continued. In particular, this has affected the combining gear , which links the two main diesel engines to a pair of gas turbines to its water jet propulsion system. Having this machinery function properly is critical to the vessels being able to reach a speed of 40 knots, which was a requirement from an early stage in the program. USS Freedom underway during a 2014 Independent Deployer Certification Exercise (IDCERTEX) off the coast of Southern California and Hawaii., U.S. Navy/MC3 Katarzyna Kobiljak Meanwhile, despite the removal of earlier units in the two subclasses, production of the LCS continues. There are now 21 LCSs in service, following yesterday’s decommissioning. These include nine of the Freedom class, of which there are five more under construction or in the process of fitting out, and one more example on order. There are also 12 Independence- class warships in service, with five more under construction or fitting out, and one more on order. Problems with the drive train led to the Navy putting a pause in deliveries of Freedom class ships earlier this year. Now, with the first ship in each LCS subclass having been decommissioned, the Navy has its eye on the deactivation of three Freedom- class ships, the USS Fort Worth (LCS-3), Detroit (LCS-7), and Little Rock (LCS-9), plus one Independence- class vessel, USS Coronado (LCS-4). USS Fort Worth (LCS-3), left, arrives in Singapore as the Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Sampson (DDG-102) gets underway. , U.S. Navy/MC1 Jay C. Pugh The service hopes to be rid of these next four vessels by March 22 next year, as part of its latest budget request for Fiscal Year 2022, but that will depend on Congressional approval. Of the next vessels destined for disposal, LCS-7 and LCS-9 have been earmarked for decommissioning due to problems with the combining gear. As for LCS-3 and LCS-4, their retirement has been recommended due to the expense of upgrading them to a configuration that would provide commonality with other more recent LCSs. If the Navy’s plans for these four ships are approved, they will be placed in “ Out of Commission, In Reserve ” status, meaning they could theoretically be reactivated if required. USS Independence (LCS-2), the lead ship of the class, was the first of the Littoral Combat Ships, to be decommissioned, at Naval Base San Diego, on July 29., U.S. Navy While the Navy remains committed to building its troublesome LCS vessels, at the same time it is planning to introduce a new class of frigates, the FFG-62 Constellation class , with construction expected to begin on the first hull imminently. However, the new warships are not expected to enter service until the late 2020s, meaning there is still a requirement for the LCS, at least on paper, even if only as a stopgap measure. An artist’s conception of the forthcoming FFG-62 Constellation- class frigate., U.S. Navy As if to demonstrate growing confidence in the LCS vessels, the Navy has announced plans to deploy six LCSs before the end of this year. This would be a significant milestone for the ships, which have so far deployed only sporadically, with more than one of those cruises being interrupted by embarrassing mechanical failures . To this date, no Littoral Combat Ship has deployed to the Middle East, including to the tumultuous Persian Gulf, an area where these giant jet boats were supposedly designed to dominate. There are also hopes that new capabilities will increase the operational value of the LCSs, including the planned addition of the Naval Strike Missile , or NSM, on all of the hulls. Thought has also been given to adapting the ships to suit the expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO) concept, currently being developed by the Navy and Marine Corps. Some have suggested the LCS might be used in a role akin to a fast troop transport , to move small groups of infantry around the Indo-Pacific theater. The Independence- class LCS USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS-10) launches a Naval Strike Missile (NSM) during exercise Pacific Griffin., U.S. Navy The decommissioning of the USS Freedom , coupled with the removal of the first of the Independence- class vessels, brings at least one chapter of the LCS saga to an end. At the same time, with a stated ambition to reach a total fleet size of 355 ships , the decision to remove any hulls prematurely that would help reach this total is not one taken lightly. While the Navy has not entirely given up hope in these warships, it seems clear that the service’s future priorities lie elsewhere. Update, October 1: Following a request from The War Zone , the Navy has confirmed that the former USS Freedom will be placed in “Out of Commission, In Reserve” (OCIR) status, as is also planned for the other four LCSs that the service wants to withdraw. OCIR ships are stored in Bremerton, Washington. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Americas Around The Globe News & Features U.S. Homeland"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 22, 2021",Skunk Works Boss Says He Can’t Comment On Video Of Mysterious Stealth Shape At Radar Test Range,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, Jeff Babione, the head of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division declined to comment in a somewhat cryptic way on a video that emerged last week showing what looked to be a stealthy, advanced fighter aircraft-like test shape at the company’s secretive Helendale radar-cross section (RCS) measurement facility. Separately, Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown said he was not aware of the clip and couldn’t comment on it. Babione did, however, seem to confirm that the authenticity of the footage, which The War Zone was first to report on and that you can read more about in our initial story here . Babione, the Skunk Works’ Vice President and General Manager, offered his comments about the video of the test shape at Helendale during a discussion with Defense One ‘s Marcus Weisgerber as part of a larger online event that the outlet hosted. Air Force Chief of Staff Brown offered his response during a separate one-on-one interview with Defense One ‘s Tara Copp. A screenshot from the video shot at Lockheed Martin’s Helendale radar-cross section (RCS) measurement facility that appears to show a stealthy test shape on a trailer., via Twitter “Can you tell us anything about this?” Weisgerber asked. “I can’t,” Babione replied without offering any further explanation of what the test shape was. This response was somewhat curious, since one would think that if this was something non-sensitive, such as a test shape for calibration purposes, he would be able to simply say so. “Has your security posture changed?” Weisgerber followed up with, given that Helendale is a highly sensitive facility and one would imagine that shooting personal videos about what goes there is a violation of protocol. “We’re good,” Babione said. When Tara Copp asked Air Force Chief of Staff Brown later about the same video clip, which she described as a still photograph, he said he was “not aware of that particular photo” and couldn’t comment on it. It’s interesting to note that Babione, who had otherwise been talking about how Skunks Works has changed and evolved in recent years, spent most of his time talking with Weisgerber via web conference sitting in front of a background showing an artist’s conception of the X-59A Quiet SuperSonic Technology (QueSST) demonstrator aircraft, which Skunk Works is building for NASA, as well as a notional passenger plane derived from that design. At one point, however, the background changed to a different one, seen below, showing artwork depicting what appeared to be a stealthy unmanned aircraft without vertical tails. A screen capture from the Defense One web event yesterday showing Skunk Works head Jeff Babione sitting in front of an artist’s conception of what appears to be a stealthy unmanned aircraft. , Defense One capture Babione had otherwise been chatting to Weisgerber, along with Dr. Michael G. Smayda, a co-found founder of and the Chief Product Officer at hypersonic aviation startup Hermeus , about design and development processes, among other things. The Skunk Works boss had highlighted his division’s significant expansion since 2017, driven in large part by Lockheed Martin receiving contracts for various unspecified classified projects. This is the largest period of growth for Skunk Works since it led the development of the X-35 prototype that evolved into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . “Right after we won F-35 – 2001, we were relatively small as we began to prepare and win the next [contract],” Babione said. “That’s really what happened in 2018 and 2019.” Since then, “quite simply put… it’s exploded. We’ve grown by more than three times in total staff [and] really expanded our footprint,” he explained, noting that Skunk Works has gone from being primarily based in Southern California, at Plant 42 in Palmdale , to also operating within Lockheed Martin facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, and in Marietta, Georgia. This is “all in support of some new classified programs and the opportunity to win future business.” While Babione did not name any specific programs, we do know that Skunk Works is involved in a number of hypersonic weapon programs for various branches of the U.S. military . Many of those efforts date back to the late 2010s timeframe that the head of Skunk Works had said marked the beginning of Skunk Works’ most recent growth in personnel and physical plant space. Of course, Lockheed Martin has previously told The War Zone that 85 percent of what Skunk Works does is classified. We are aware of a number of other classified advanced aviation programs , including efforts that may be relevant to the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which it is running now in addition to the hypersonic projects that have been publicly disclosed. There is even more work being done outside of the public eye. Skunk Works’ expansion in recent years is also part of a broader “digital transformation” within Lockheed Martin, as a whole, which is typified in the design of a new, highly automated advanced production facility that was recently opened at Plant 42 that you can read about more here . That specific facility is part of a major investment in new infrastructure that also includes tens of thousands of additional square feet of secure storage space for classified assets at Helendale, where the video of the mysterious test shape was shot. An increased emphasis on digital engineering tools is another part of this company-wide transformation. “If I made a change to the structural aspects of the airplane, then someone else would go do an analysis, make their own models that says how did that change the aerodynamics,” Babione explained to Weisgerber. “And based on the aerodynamics change, there’d be loads change, and then that would come back me,” he continued. “And all that was done kind of in a separate way.” This has all changed with the continued introduction of digital engineering tools at Lockheed Martin, including within Skunk Works. The company has named its particular toolset Stardrive, which you can learn more about here . “So why do we care about that?” Babione asked rhetorically. “Well, it dramatically compresses the time between concept and capability.” “One metric that we look at is the hours per pound, so how long does it take to build something based on its weight. It’s just a parameter that’s commonly used in aircraft design,” he said. “And we’re seeing a two-thirds reduction in the time to build something. And that’s dramatic. That not only compresses the time, obviously, but it reduces the cost, which then enables you to put more inside your factory, [and] ultimately pass lower costs on to the customer.” Babione did say that “you can’t eliminate flight test” and highlighted how customer testing and other requirements, especially from the U.S. military, can still create bottlenecks. However, the idea is that digital engineering capabilities mean “we’ll get to flight test faster” and that Skunk Works will be “only testing the points we absolutely need to,” which will still help accelerate the entire process. He added that Skunk Works has already seen “tremendous gains in the speed [the development of assets] and ultimately reducing the cost of the assets that we’re making.” Skunk Works projects aren’t the only advanced military aerospace research and development efforts keeping the defense press and the general public preoccupied. There continues to be immense interest in when we will get our first real look at Northrop Grumman’s B-21 Raider stealth bomber . Last week, the Air Force revealed that there are five of these aircraft currently in various stages of production , three more than it had previously disclosed were being built. The most recent official rendering of the B-21 stealth bomber., USAF “There will be a ceremony at some point – whether it’s for the very first one for the first flight, or a little later,” Air Force Chief of Staff Brown told Tara Copp . “I’m sure we’ll do something special as we bring out the B-21.” All told, while Babione, as well as Chief of Staff Brown, couldn’t comment on whatever was seen in the video from Helendale, it is well in line with the kind of advanced aerospace projects, and the ability to get them to the prototype stage quickly, that Skunk Works is already well known for . The workload for Lockheed Martin’s advanced projects division only continues to grow as the entire company looks toward its new digital future. At the same time, the U.S. military is pushing toward its own new phase of aerial combat capability, across the services, with various elements also likely to emerge publicly in the coming years.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",Royal Navy Is Experimenting With Launching Jet-Powered Drones From Its New Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Royal Navy has kicked off an exciting series of trials for the service by launching jet-powered drones from the deck of one of its new carriers for the first time. The initial tests involved the QinetiQ Banshee Jet 80+, best known as a target drone, onboard the HMS Prince of Wales , but the drone also demonstrated the broader potential for flying future adversary missions and more capable operational unmanned aerial vehicles from the Royal Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth class carriers. In what the Royal Navy described in a statement as a “landmark demonstration,” HMS Prince of Wales launched three Banshee air vehicles during trials off the northwest coast of Scotland. These workups include Exercise Joint Warrior , a large-scale set of multinational maneuvers. A Banshee drone is fired from a catapult launcher on the deck of HMS Prince of Wales during the recent demonstration., Crown Copyright Powered by a pair of small jet engines, the Banshee can be launched by a portable catapult from the deck of an aircraft carrier, or potentially any other large vessel, and recovered under a parachute after completing its mission. In these trials, the drones touched down on dry land, but they could potentially be retrieved from the sea, as well. In addition to the roughly 11-foot-long drone itself, the trials explored how the launch system and other support equipment can be integrated with the carrier during fixed- and rotary-wing operations on the flight deck. The Royal Navy has made it a high priority to look at the potential of the Banshee to replicate the kinds of threats that might be faced by the service’s carriers and other surface vessels, including fast jets and anti-ship missiles. Currently, this kind of threat replication work is performed by a dedicated aggressor unit, 736 Naval Air Squadron (NAS), flying Hawk T1 jet trainers, but these jets are now due to be retired next April, leaving a gap that could potentially be filled by unmanned platforms. The characteristics of the Banshee, which include a 25,000-foot ceiling, up to 400-knot speed, a 54-mile range, and the ability to approach a warship at sea-skimming height, would make it suitable to replicate certain antiship threats, a job previously carried out primarily by the Hawks of 736 NAS. https://youtube.com/watch?v=gPpaLFeb_iE The Royal Navy describes the Banshee drone as “hard to detect on radar, giving it all the likeness of an incoming missile — making it a realistic adversary for sailors to train in countering aerial threats.” While the 736 NAS Hawks fly primarily from Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose, in southwest England, the Banshee could be taken aboard one of the two Queen Elizabeth- class carriers during large-scale exercises and pre-deployment workups, providing an organic aerial adversary anywhere in the world, and one that can be engaged using live weapons or other countermeasures. Since the Banshee can also carry a payload, it would be able to offer a range of additional threat capabilities. Perhaps the most interesting is QinetiQ’s Rattler supersonic target drone , which can in turn be launched from the Banshee. That would allow the subsonic drone to also replicate the launch platform of faster-flying threats, such as high-speed anti-ship or anti-radiation missiles. A QinetiQ Rattler supersonic target drone attached to the underside of a Banshee aerial target., QinetiQ That same payload capacity also lends the Banshee to roles beyond adversary work, even if only on an experimental level. With the Royal Navy, and the British Armed Forces in general, concerned with developing unmanned combat capabilities, the Banshee could be a useful stepping-stone to achieving some of these ambitions. The Royal Navy says the Banshee could be suitable for “testing future sensors, weaponry, and radio equipment.” “There is a real need for a low-cost drone such as the Banshee that can replicate a range of the threats in the skies and provide a testbed for future payloads,” said Commander Rob Taylor, lead for Royal Navy Air Test and Evaluation. “The key to this is that a warship can carry this drone with it on operations, launch it and use it to keep personnel razor-sharp in countering threats from above. The ability to adapt the payload for differing tasks is also crucial to provide value for money and interoperability across the fleet,” Taylor added. A Banshee target drone and an F-35B stealth fighter on the deck of HMS Prince of Wales ., Crown Copyright The drones could also potentially be turned into real kinetic weapons themselves, operating in swarms to overwhelm enemy vessels and land-based targets, as well as for reconnaissance, decoy, and stand-in electronic warfare support. In fact, this is exactly the type of concept the Royal Air Force is working on right now, which you can read about here , and it could be extremely relevant to the Royal Navy’s operations. Swarms of these drones armed with electronic warfare systems and kinetic warheads could wreak havoc on an enemy’s shoreline defenses, for instance, prior to manned aviation operations. While the replacement of the aggressor capability provided by 736 NAS is one part of the Banshee experiment, and it’s possible that using them as real weapons could occur in the future, as well, the Royal Navy Develop Directorate’s Project Vampire is undertaking the wider evaluation of carrier-based drones. Project Vampire specifies the use study of “lightweight, fixed-wing carrier-borne crewless autonomous systems,” for which the Banshee provides a useful surrogate. Target drones have been launched from naval ships for decades, especially U.S. Navy ones (from a destroyer and a carrier as seen above), but where the Banshee tests could head in terms of capabilities is very different than just providing targets to track and even shoot at. , USN Project Vampire, in turn, is just one element of the Royal Navy’s broader aerial drone ambitions, as it runs a number of demonstrations that seek to determine what type of UAVs could be fielded as part of its Future Maritime Aviation Force. That wider program will examine the capabilities offered by current and future drone technologies and will include both rotary-wing and fixed-wing drones “to fulfill a number of tasks to increase mass on the carriers and allow crewed aircraft to maximize their capacity.” At the larger end of the UAV spectrum, Project Vixen is examining the potential for operating larger drones from British carrier decks. These could undertake a wide array of operational and support missions, including aerial refueling — a role being developed by the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray — as well as strike, potentially in a loyal wingman-type role, networked together with British F-35B Lightning stealth fighters. Other missions could include surveillance and electronic warfare. The U.S. Navy’s new MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based tanker drone demonstrator refuels an F-35C. An organic tanker drone would be a useful, if costly, force multiplier for a Royal Navy carrier strike group., BOEING As The War Zone has discussed in the past , Project Vixen is currently being run as a conceptual project and there’s no promise of hardware at the end of it. Perhaps one option to increase the likelihood of Project Vixen yielding a carrier-based drone would be to pool resources with the Royal Air Force, which is working on the parallel Team Mosquito project as part of the Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) initiative. There have been reports in the past that the two services are already working together to study potential platforms for Mosquito and Vixen. For its part, Team Mosquito aims to have a prototype low-cost “uncrewed fighter aircraft” for the RAF flying by 2023. An artist’s conception of a Team Mosquito drone operating alongside a British F-35B., U.K. Ministry of Defense Project Mosquito also includes the study of drones that can operate together semi-autonomously with manned aircraft, which could also be of interest to the Royal Navy, especially in regard to a potential loyal wingman counterpart to the F-35B. With the British Lightning order under threat , the ability to boost ‘combat mass’ in this way could be very appealing. In parallel to Project Vixen, the Royal Navy is studying how to best operate larger drones from the Queen Elizabeth class carriers. Earlier this year, the U.K. Ministry of Defence put out a request for information (RFI) for “aircraft launch and recovery equipment.” This RFI seeks information on assisted launch and arrested recovery “for a range of air vehicles, which would be suitable to fit a vessel within three to five years,” again, as part of the development work for the Future Maritime Aviation Force. Since the Queen Elizabeth class carriers do not have catapults for launching aircraft or arrester wires for recovering them, the Royal Navy is looking at adding an electromagnetic catapult and various arrestor solutions. The U.K. Ministry of Defence says it’s looking for information on “solutions which are sufficiently technically mature to be fitted to a suitable ship from 2023.” A British F-35B Lightning takes off from HMS Queen Elizabeth via the “ski jump” ramp., Crown Copyright The addition of some kind of ‘cat and trap’ equipment on its carriers would be a complex and costly undertaking, and the Royal Navy may yet decide instead to concentrate on vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone types, reflecting the approach taken by the U.S. Marine Corps. There’s no doubt that designing and developing a carrier-based drone, especially one large enough to undertake critical support missions, such as aerial refueling, is no easy task. Even with the carrier aviation experience and deep pockets of the U.S. Navy, the path to fielding a carrier-capable fixed-wing drone has been a long one, although new solutions could be on the horizon. With all this in mind, it shouldn’t be a surprise if we see the United Kingdom’s ambitions to bring drones to its carrier decks scaled down. On the other hand, any such program has to start somewhere, and it could be that the recent Banshee trials lead to much more impressive capabilities down the line. At the very least, maybe the Banshees trials could lead to a quicker path to realizing the ability to deploy large swarms of lower-cost drones—for strike, electronic warfare, or surveillance purposes—that can operate significantly far over the horizon from Royal Navy warships in the not so distant future.

Michael Peck,"Posted on Jan 4, 2022",Indian Su-30 Flankers To Dogfight Japanese Fighters Later This Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Indian Air Force is sending its Su-30MKI Flanker fighters to Japan for joint exercises with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), according to Japan’s Sankei Shimbun newspaper . The fighter exercises were originally scheduled for 2020 and then summer 2021, only to be postponed both times by the coronavirus pandemic. “But the [Japan] Air Self-Defense Force and the Indian Air Force have agreed that they would like to realize it by the end of the year in view of the threat of China,” Sankei Shimbun said. While Indian Su-30s have participated in joint exercises with U.S. F-15s and British Typhoons , among other units and types, this would mark a rare opportunity for Japanese fighter pilots — who fly F-15s, F-2s, and newly acquired F-35s — to practice dissimilar air-combat training against the Russian-designed Su-30. Japan faces not only Chinese Su-30s, but also Su-30s flown by Russia, with whom Japan has territorial disputes, as well as many other Flanker derivatives in both potential adversaries’ air arms. Japan’s F-15J and F-2 in formation., JASDF “The value for Japan of being able to train with Indian Su-30s could be significant,” Corey Wallace, who teaches East Asian security at Japan’s Kanagawa University, told The War Zone . “The JASDF can look forward to enhancing its pilots’ understanding of the Su-30’s maneuverability, cruising range, fuel consumption, and turnaround times for maintenance, which could be vital for planning during a protracted conflict.” In addition, India’s Su-30s are equipped with three-dimensional thrust vectoring capability, which makes them especially unique to train against in traditional within-visual-range air combat scenarios. Perhaps more important, the exercises are a worrisome signal to Beijing that its rivals India and Japan are tightening their defense ties. Chinese and Indian troops fought deadly border clashes in the Himalayas in 2020, while China and Japan are at odds over Chinese claims to the Japanese-held Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. “India well understands that its greatest leverage against China is the prospect of joining in combinations with like-minded partners like Japan,” Arzan Tarapore, a South Asian studies scholar at Stanford University, told The War Zone . “This threat of coalition-building, rather than anything that India does alone, is what scares Beijing the most.” Planning for the exercise dates back to December 2018, when the JASDF dispatched a C-2 transport to Agra Air Force Base in India for joint training with IAF C-17s, followed in 2019 by a JASDF C-130. IAF Su-30MKIs training alongside RAF Typhoons., IAF “This paved the way for regular joint training, and the ASDF and the Indian Air Force decided to raise the level of training content and conduct joint training for fighters,” Sankei Shimbun reports. Indian Su-30s were first supposed to train with Japanese F-15s at Komatsu Airbase in June 2020 — only to see the event postponed by the first wave of coronavirus. Training was then shifted to F-2 fighters at Hyakuri Airbase in July 2021, but this was put on hold because of the Delta variant of Covid-19. Interestingly, the Su-30 — an advanced descendant of the ubiquitous Su-27 Flanker family of heavy fighters — could fight on both sides in a China-India conflict. The Flanker family is the backbone of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force and Navy heavy fighter fleets, including 97 Su-30MKK and Su-30MK2 aircraft, as well as more than 500 J-11, J-15 , and J-16 aircraft, which are Chinese-licensed copies or indigenous designs based directly on the Flanker. India has 272 Su-30MKI fighters , most of which were assembled under license in India by Indian aviation manufacturer HAL. The Indian aircraft feature Israeli and French avionics and electronic warfare systems, while China’s Su-30MKK and MK2 borrow limited features from the even more advanced Su-35 , another Flanker derivative flying in limited numbers with China’s and Russia’s Air Forces. The symbolic value of the Indo-Japanese aerial exercises may actually be more potent than the military benefits. India and Japan, along with the United States and Australia, comprise the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad), an informal security alliance that’s essentially aimed at containing China. With India on China’s southwest border, Japan on China’s northeast frontier, and the United States, Australia, and Taiwan to the east and south, Beijing may be feeling surrounded. Tighter defense cooperation between India and Japan will only reinforce that feeling. “This is very clear diplomatic signaling from two Quad partners whose relationship has promised much but has underdelivered up until now,” noted Wallace. IAF Su-30MKI taking off from Nellis AFB during Red Flag in 2008., USAF Indian Su-30s in Japan could be the start of something bigger: Indian and Japanese forces sharing each other’s military bases. Wallace points to the aerial exercises as well as the Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement (ACSA) signed by India and Japan in September 2020, which allows the armed forces of both nations to share services and supplies. “The broader strategic significance of this agreement is that it allows the Indian military to access Japanese bases in Japan, but also Japan’s Djibouti base near key Middle East sea lanes,” Wallace said. “In return, it provides the Japanese greater access to major Indian bases in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal, which sit astride western approaches to the Malacca Strait.” Su-30MKI’s massive nosecone tilted upwards for access to the aircraft’s powerful radar and other systems. , AP Historically, Japan has been reluctant to project military power abroad since 1945. That’s partly because of Article 9 of Japan’s U.S.-written postwar constitution , which renounces war and offensive capabilities, though these inhibitions may be fading as Japan confronts growing Chinese power. While operating from Indian bases might be politically sensitive, it would allow Japan to protect vital maritime trade routes — and also to discomfit China. Still, operationalizing such a strategy may not happen on a consistent basis in the near term, it could occur during a crisis or eventually in support of Japan’s new push to project naval power abroad. Tarapore also doubts India would agree to such joint-basing on a permanent basis. “That’s because of the priority that India places on what it calls ‘strategic autonomy,’ or not entering into any binding security commitments,” Tarapore said. “And you can’t get much more committed than deployed forces to another country’s territory, or having them deployed to yours.” Regardless, multinational exercises are an invaluable tool for training. U.S. pilots, for example, have benefited greatly from practicing against Indian Su-30s during past Cope India exercises, not just because of exposure to foreign equipment, but also a chance to observe wily foreign tactics. And in Japan’s case, if similar exercises happen to send a signal to potential adversaries such as China, so much the better. IAF Su-30s and USAF F-15s trained with each other first during Cope India in 2004, an exercise that had major implications for the USAF and its tactics and hardware decisions that followed. , USAF Michael Peck Contributor Around The Globe Indo-Pacific Japan News & Features"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 22, 2020",20 KC-135s Were Rapidly Launched Out Of Fairchild AFB This Morning (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Aircraft trackers got a special surprise on Wednesday, September 29th, when a massive string of KC-135 tankers launched in quick succession out of Fairchild Air Force Base in northeastern Washington State. Soon it became apparent that no less than 17, and possibly more [the number was 20, see the update at the bottom of the post], of the ancient aerial refuelers were on some sort of mission, flying in a tightly-packed line across the northern United States. The massive launch is likely part of a major readiness exercise, as we have seen across other bases and types in the past . The tankers were even photographed on the ground at Fairchild AFB in a long line before their quick-interval launch (see below). A similar drill was held at Fairchild in 2012 , but without so many aircraft actually launching it would seem. Other large-scale USAF transport missions that span the country include Joint Forcible Entry (JFEX) exercises , but this does not appear to be part of that type of evolution. Other strategic exercises feature mass sorties by KC-135s, but we are unaware of any going on right now. The youngest of these KC-135s is nearly 60 years old. As such, putting so many into the air at once from a single base is a testament to Boeing’s design and especially to the men and women who maintain the aircraft, which can be considered antique in most regards. The exercise seems to leverage the minimum interval takeoff (MITO) tactics that were made famous during the Cold War and are still employed today, though to a lesser degree: Some in the formation have since broken away, with four groups now heading in different directions: The KC-135 remains the backbone of the USAF’s tanker force, with nearly 400 still flying with the force. It will soldier on for decades to come, helped in part by the fact that moves to replace the type that continue to be mired in delays. We have reached out to Fairchild AFB for information on this unique gaggle of Stratotankers, we will report back when they get back to us. UPDATE: The War Zone talked with Captain Kaitlin Holmes, the Chief of Public Affairs for the 92nd Air Refueling Wing about the operation, which was indeed historic: “So we’ve launched a 20-ship flight in what we call minimal-interval takeoffs. It was actually the biggest takeoffs that we’ve had of KC-135s here at Fairchild. The purpose was a proficiency and readiness exercise. So it was validating our maintenance crews, generation capabilities, and our operational capabilities to launch multiple aircraft using minimum takeoff interval procedures. We’re really proud of it because it was able to showcase the readiness of the 92nd air refueling wing, or our aircrew, and of our aircraft. Pretty exciting stuff, and we’re happy to make history here at Fairchild.” 20 KC-135s launching in quick succession is indeed an amazing feat. Hopefully, we will get some images soon of the major undertaking. UPDATE: Here is the official statement from the 92nd Air Refueling Wing and some images of the operation: The 92nd Air Refueling Wing successfully launched a 20-ship Minimum Interval Take-Off (MITO) here today. This was an impressive feat boasting the largest take-off of a KC-135 fleet at Fairchild Air Force Base. Today we launched more Refuelers than are owned by whole countries. Previous to take-off, the jets lined up in an “elephant walk”. The MITO was part of a proficiency and readiness exercise, sought to validate Fairchild’s maintenance generation and operational capabilities to launch multiple aircraft using minimum interval take-off procedures. This capability showcases the readiness of the 92nd Air Refueling Wing aircrew and our 60+ year old aircraft fleet. 92nd ARW Public Affairs 92nd ARW Public Affairs 92nd ARW Public Affairs Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 20, 2021",Hypersonic Missile Tests For The B-1 Bomber Are Coming Next Year According To Boeing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing officials have said they aim to start testing new hypersonic weapons capabilities for the B-1B Lancer bomber in September next year, although it’s unclear at this stage what these trials might consist of. While the U.S. Air Force continues with plans to withdraw the B-1 , most recently sending 17 of the 60 remaining aircraft to the boneyard , the service is meanwhile pressing ahead with plans to arm its remaining Lancers with new hypersonic weaponry . Increasingly, the planned weapons upgrades for the B-1 are seen as a means of not only keeping pace with worrisome developments in Russia and China, but also of providing cover for the B-52H Stratofortress fleet as it undergoes its own enhancements, including an ambitious re-engining program that will see fleet availability reduced while underway. Details of the ongoing plans to turn the B-1 into a ‘missile truck’ for new hypersonic weapons emerged recently during a talk by Boeing officials at the Military Affairs Committee of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce, the business interest organization in the Texas city that’s also home to an operational Lancer unit, the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base . The results of that meeting were published by the Abilene Reporter-News daily newspaper and shed light on the current plans. A B-1B Lancer climbs out of Dyess Air Force Base, Texas., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Rebecca Van Syoc The Boeing officials outlined how the surviving B-1 fleet will be enhanced until the type’s ultimate retirement in favor of the forthcoming B-21 Raider , a new-generation stealth bomber, the latest progress on which you can read more about here . The Air Force expects the first operational examples of the B-21 to enter service at another B-1 base, Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, sometime in the mid-2020s, followed by Dyess Air Force Base, and Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the latter being the home of the B-2 Spirit fleet. With that in mind, the B-1 fleet at Ellsworth could be expected to serve for another decade or more . The introduction of hypersonic missiles is planned as a key component of keeping the B-1 relevant until then. Several experimental air-launched hypersonic missiles are already under test , albeit with mixed results during initial trials. According to Robert Gass, former Dyess Air Force Base commander turned strategic development and investment manager for Boeing’s bombers program, the B-1 will have its Cold War-era external weapons carriage capability reactivated to accommodate the new weapons. Work to reactivate the B-1’s hardpoints has actually already begun , initially to carry up to a dozen more subsonic AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) cruise missiles, or AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile derivatives, in addition to 24 more of either of those weapons that fit in its internal bomb bays . A B-1B carrying an inert AGM-158 JASSM cruise missile on a pylon under its fuselage for the first time., U.S. Air Force The same basic weapons interfaces are slated to be adapted for hypersonic missiles, too. Gass said that these kinds of weapons are “the next big thing in bombers,” but they are dimensionally big, too, making external carriage preferable, and perhaps even a requirement. So, what’s next for the B-1? First, it’s important to note that Boeing doesn’t expect it to be cheap to outfit the swing-wing bombers with hypersonic weapons capabilities and the program will have to negotiate defense budgets if it’s to succeed. Much of the cost will be absorbed by reactivating the long-dormant external hardpoints, which were once intended to carry nuclear weapons, before the B-1 lost this role after the end of the Cold War. The pylons were then disabled as the aircraft was made compliant with New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) regulations. A B-1B bomber during tests with six external pylons fitted., U.S. Air Force While Rockwell designed the B-1 with eight external hardpoints , Ruder said six of these can be reinstated and used for hypersonic stores. Each of these new Load Adaptive Modular, or LAM, pylons will be able to accommodate two missiles, although the specific type, or propulsion variety, was not specified. Noteworthy is the fact the original external pylons on the B-1B could also carry two missiles each, in this case, the nuclear-tipped AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile , or ALCM. According to Ruder, the largest hypersonic missiles will weigh 5,000 pounds and be more than 20 feet long. Again, the missile being described was not named, but these specifications seem to be broadly in line with what little we know about the ARRW. On the other hand, the LAM pylons may also be intended to carry other more conventional weaponry, too, like the aforementioned JASSM cruise missile and its derivatives. There was no mention of internal carriage of additional hypersonic weapons, although this is something that has been explored in the past by Air Force Magazine , which calculated that a combination of external pylons and common rotary launchers in the internal bomb bays, could potentially carry a mix of up to 31 hypersonic missiles. Based on what the Boeing officials said, it seems that a more modest external load of 12 hypersonic missiles may now be the plan. Prior to such weapons being loaded onto a B-1, however, the LAM pylons themselves would need to be integrated and proven, before captive-carry trials of representative payloads could begin, followed by the release of inert weapons, and finally end-to-end testing. The view inside the internal weapons bay of a B-1B, partially loaded with JASSMs. Up to 24 of these weapons can currently be accommodated in the weapons bays., PACIFIC AIR FORCES PUBLIC AFFAIRS / PUBLIC DOMAIN Gass confirmed that plans call for the B-1 to eventually serve as a launch platform for two kinds of hypersonic weapons: boost-glide vehicles and air-breathing missiles. The first category, boost-glide vehicles, suggests the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid-Response Weapon , or AARW, which is pronounced “arrow,” a hypersonic missile that we also know will be carried by the B-52. To attain hypersonic speeds, the missile consists of a solid-fuel rocket booster, fitted with pop-out tail fins, and the unpowered boost-glide vehicle. After being propelled to a specific speed and altitude atop the rocket booster, the wedge-shaped boost-glide vehicle continues to its target at hypersonic speed. An artist’s conception of an AGM-183A ARRW in flight as its nose cone separates, revealing the unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle warhead., Lockheed Martin The second category, air-breathing missiles, could refer to a development of the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC, a scramjet vehicle that was recently tested , accelerating to a speed of more than Mach 5 after air launch from a B-52. There’s also the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile , or HACM, another program involving an air-breathing weapon that would be suitable for carriage by fighter and bomber aircraft. Last year, U.S. Air Force General Timothy Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all of America’s bomber fleets, identified the B-1 as a candidate to carry both the AARW and the HAWC, although the Boeing officials didn’t identify the proposed weapons by name. An artist’s conception of an air-breathing hypersonic missile released by DARPA in relation to the HAWC program., DARPA At this stage, none of ARRW, HAWC, or HACM are expected to result in nuclear-armed weapons, with all relying on a conventional warhead initially. Speaking in Abilene, Dan Ruder, Boeing’s advanced programs manager, reportedly told the audience that hypersonic weapons that in the future could travel at Mach 20 — noting that this is “extremely fast.” In fact, such a speed seems well beyond the capabilities of the air-breathing HAWC and HACM concepts, both of which are expected to cruise at speeds of Mach 5+. On the other hand, the Air Force has, in the past , said the ARRW would fly at a speed of roughly between Mach 6.5 and Mach 8, which may well be an underestimation. Previously, for example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said that the boost-glide vehicle being developed for its Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) program could potentially hit a peak speed of Mach 20. During flight tests in 2010 and 2011, DARPA’s Hypersonic Test Vehicle 2 (HTV-2), another boost-glide vehicle, also reached peak speeds of Mach 20. An illustration depicting the DARPA Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle (HTV) as it emerges from its rocket nose cone and prepares to re-enter the atmosphere., U.S. Army Moreover, it’s not clear if Ruder’s Mach 20 comment was in reference to any kind of weapon planned for carriage by the B-1, or if he was making a more general point about the kinds of speeds that are made possible by hypersonic designs in general. Either way, Robert Gass put forward the fundamental advantages of each approach to hypersonic propulsion, noting that the boost-glide vehicle type offered long-range and maneuverability to evade enemy defenses, as well as not requiring such a large warhead, due to its terminal velocity. For their part, air-breathing hypersonic missiles would offer the B-1 and other platforms the ability to carry more weapons, since they are smaller and lighter than their boost-glide vehicle counterparts. They also fly deeper within the atmosphere, making a more complicated target for enemy air defenses that are not equipped to counter very high-speed threats. The tradeoff, however, is a weapon, or weapons, with reduced speed and range. An AGM-183A ARRW experimental article is prepared for loading aboard a B-52H bomber ahead of a test flight., U.S. Air Force Either way, the standoff capabilities of either type of hypersonic weapons should afford the B-1 more protection, allowing it to launch missiles further from hostile air defenses, at what Gass called a “more survivable distance.” This is of particular relevance as adversaries such as Russia and China continue to bolster their anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities , including the introduction of anti-aircraft weapons with ever-longer ranges . At the same time, the B-1 itself has had its operating envelope scaled back as a result of wear and tear inflicted in the course of extensive combat operations over Afghanistan and the Middle East. Crews are now forbidden from flying at low altitudes, while total annual flight hours have been restricted, which you can read about more in this past War Zone exclusive . Adding new weapons, with longer standoff range, could help mitigate these factors. Interestingly, the Boeing officials both presented hypersonic weapons as an area in which the United States is lagging behind its rivals, with the envisaged B-1 modernization seen as a way of mitigating that, at least in the short term. A graphic presented at the meeting showed Russia, with its 3M22 Zircon naval hypersonic missile to be furthest ahead along the developmental path, followed by China, with its XingKong-2 ( Starry Sky-2 ), which Beijing has described as a hypersonic waverider vehicle. Next comes the United States, together with Australia, with which it is partnering on more than one hypersonic program. Lagging further behind were France ( V-Max ) and India ( BrahMos ). There were, however, some discrepancies in that graphic, with the Zircon illustrated by the air-launched Kinzhal, while only the United States/Australia was credited with an air-breathing hypersonic weapon (both Zircon and the hypersonic version of BrahMos are air-breathing designs). Moreover, the two stated leaders in the field are both known to have introduced other hypersonic weapons to service, including China’s ground-launched DF-17 and Russia’s silo-launched Avangard . While starting tests this time next year would seem to be a fast-paced timeline, it’s in keeping with the desire to catch up with the perceived hypersonic head-start enjoyed by Russia and China. Furthermore, with the B-21 potentially entering service from the mid-2020s, there’s might not be much time left for the B-1 to serve in its planned new role as a launch platform for hypersonic missiles.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another new Chinese drone development has caught the eye of experts and observers at the country’s big international airshow in Zhuhai, which began officially today. Known as the FH-97, it looks for all intents and purposes, like a clone of the XQ-58A Valkyrie , the stealthy, affordable unmanned aircraft that has been developed by U.S. drone-maker Kratos. The Chinese FH-97 drone, which is being offered by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, or CASC, would seem to have been tailored to fulfill the same kinds of combat roles as envisaged for the Valkyrie, which is being developed for the U.S. Air Force as the centerpiece of its work on unmanned attritable platforms â€” drones that are low-cost yet still survivable enough that they can be employed in high-risk situations that might preclude the use of a more costly asset. The FH-97 was revealed at Zhuhai in the form of a mock-up on the CASC stand, one of a number of drones of different sizes being marketed by the company. Like the Valkyrie, the Chinese FH-97 features a stealthy trapezoidal fuselage, sharply swept main wings, a V-shaped tail, and an air intake located above the fuselage. Even the fuselage weapons bay features the same stealthy serrated edges to its doors, although the Chinese drone features an electro-optical sensor in a stealthy gold-plated windowed enclosure below the nose, similar in broad appearance to the one found on the F-35 and , to an extent, the J-20 . It also features two small jet engines, instead of one. This is not too surprising considering what we understand about the limitations of China’s indigenous jet engine manufacturing capabilities. One of the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s XQ-58A Valkyries releases a much smaller ALTIUS-600 drone from its internal payload bay., U.S. AIR FORCE / COURTESY PHOTO While official promotional material for the FH-97 describes it only as a â€œmedium- and long-range UAV system,â€ it has also been identified by observers as a reconnaissance and attack UAV system, which would seem to be accurate. It is being offered as part of a new Feihong (FH) series of drones, which also includes the FH-95 multifunctional UAV driven by a pusher propeller, an unmanned helicopter with a conventional main rotor plus two propellers for forward flight, and the FH-901 loitering missile , apparently previously known as the CH-901. The latter appears to be heavily influenced by loitering munitions like the AeroVironment Switchblade . ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ China Aerospace Science & Technology Group Co.

While China has been accused of copying Western designs in the past, and the FH-97 does look remarkably similar to the Valkyrie, itâ€™s also worth noting that India, too, has opted for a very similar design approach for its own loyal wingman drone, the HAL Combat Air Teaming System (CATS). Russia’s “Grom” is also very similar, as well, among others. #AeroIndia2021 | Glimpses of HAL's Unmanned Aerial Vehicle called Warrior, it's a part of indigenous prog – CATS or Combat Air Teaming System @MugdhaCNBCTV18 @rituparnabhuyan @AeroIndiashow pic.twitter.com/2A9gM21G1p — CNBC-TV18 (@CNBCTV18News) February 3, 2021 A Kronstadt representative told TASS that the company's Grom #UCAV will be capable of controlling a swarm of up to 10 smaller Molniya recce/kamikaze #drones .

What makes the FH-97 especially interesting is that it suggests strongly that China is following the path now being taken by the U.S. Air Force, and increasingly by other air forces, too, toward fielding a stealthy, attritable drone, optimized for flying more hazardous sorties, including strike, electronic warfare, or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), within contested airspace. In addition, when coupled with parallel developments in artificial intelligence, these same kinds of drones are also expected to work as loyal wingmen in direct support of manned aircraft, or as networked swarms for a range of missions, including air-to-air combat. It is widely understood that China is already working to flight test an AI computer ‘brain’ similar to how the U.S. is executing its own Skyborg initiative . This testing could support future loyal wingmen endeavors, but really you don’t need AI for this capability. A semi-autonomous control interface from the cockpit of a manned combat aircraft within line of sight of the loyal wingman drones will provide a perfectly acceptable concept of operations and overall combat capability.Â J-20 with loyal wingmen UCAVs pic.twitter.com/GSYQY4OOZU — å½©äº‘é¦™æ±Ÿ (@louischeung_hk) September 21, 2021 With this in mind, China is also showcasing its concept for a two-seat variant of its J-20 stealthy heavy fighter.

The ability to air-launch stores beyond the kinds of offensive munitions usually associated with strike drones would offer considerably more versatility. These smaller drones could be used for kinetic strikes, to collect intelligence remotely, or, maybe most importantly, to provide stand-in electronic warfare support.Â CASIC Based on the model and the artworks of the FH-97 seen so far, itâ€™s not immediately clear how it is supposed to be launched or recovered, although there would appear to be internal space for conventional wheeled landing gear. However, as far as the XQ-58A is concerned, its main focus is being runway independentâ€”taking off via rocket assistance and landing via a parachuteâ€”making it more suitable for distributed operations, in theaters where access to conventional runways may not be guaranteed.Â An XQ-58 seen being launched on a test sortie. , USAF Kratos has also shown a model of a launch system for the Valkyrie that can be accommodated inside a standard shipping container, which could also be an option for the Chinese drone. Regardless, a capable jet-powered combat drone that is runway independent would drastically increase the possible locations from which the PLAAF could project power during a major conflict and wildly complicate its foe’s defensive plans. It could also provide relevant air combat punch over substantial ranges, even from mainland China, without relying on vulnerable runways and other infrastructure to do so. China has been notably active in the unmanned aerial vehicle field for some time now, producing a succession of drones of all kinds for both domestic use and for export. With that in mind, it may well be that the FH-97 is aimed at foreign customers as well as for the People’s Liberation Army, with CASC identifying burgeoning interest for this class of drone, based on the ongoing interest in the XQ-58A program. Moreover, the appearance of the FH-97 confirms that China, too, is at least considering the options presented by a class of drone that is both stealthy and that could have a low-cost point built-in from the outset. This would be in addition to China’s many traditional higher-end stealthy unmanned aircraft programs . #China #UCAV #FH -97 pic.twitter.com/BhK1OG9Tvz — OverHorizon (@OmniPresentEyes) September 27, 2021 Â Above all, a stealthy yet attritable multirole drone like the FH-97 would fit with what we already know about Chinaâ€™s efforts to rapidly enhance its unmanned capabilities across the board, including the development of manned-unmanned teaming and optionally manned air combat concepts. Drones like the FH-97 also bring the potential for rapidly increasing air combat â€˜mass,â€™ with the aim of overwhelming an enemy by using significant numbers of drones, as well as payloads and tactics that are intended to overwhelm or confuse hostile air defenses. A possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan , for instance, is just one example of the kind of scenario in which drones of this kind could be of extreme value. The Chinese inventory now boasts everything from long-endurance, medium-altitude, propeller-powered surveillance types , to more advanced high-altitude, long-endurance intelligence-gathering jet-powered drones, and even rocket-propelled high-speed reconnaissance drones . However itâ€™s intended to be used, the FH-97 provides yet another piece in the Chinese aerial drone puzzle, one that could quickly become a top priority within China’s increasingly complex unmanned military aircraft ecosystem. Of course, could is the operative term here as we don’t know at this time just how far along the FH-97 is in its development.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 6, 2022",North Korea Claims To Have Tested A Hypersonic Missile (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea claims that it has fired a new type of ballistic missile carrying a “detached hypersonic gliding warhead.” The regime in Pyongyang has, so far, released just one picture, seen at the top of this story, of this weapon, called the Hwasong-8, making independent assessments difficult. However, this test launch comes amid a growing missile race between North and South Korea, with both countries having unveiled a host of new designs just in recent weeks. The missile, which North Korean state media described as “strategic,” a term typically used for nuclear-armed weapons, was fired from Mupyong Ri in North Korea early on Tuesday morning, local time. The test came right before Kim Song, North Korea’s Ambassador to the United Nations, made his speech at the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering at the organization’s headquarters in New York City, where he declared his country’s “righteous right” to conduct such launches. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency had already reported that there could be indications that the weapon that the North had tested was of a novel design and might include some sort of maneuverable re-entry vehicle. “Sources in Seoul said the missile flew shorter than 200 kilometers [approximately 124 miles] at an altitude of around 60 km [approximately 37 miles], adding it shows ‘different flight features from the missiles the North previously tested,'” one story from the outlet read . At the time of the launch, one of the South Korean Air Force’s E-737 Peace Eye airborne early warning and control aircraft was airborne flying an orbit over the central part of that country. These aircraft have a very capable multirole active electronically scanned array radar that could have tracked the missile’s flight and potentially gathered telemetry data. The single picture that North Korea has released so far of the Hwasong-8 shows it only in silhouette, but it does have a very large and distinct nose section with fins, suggesting some sort of maneuvering capability. Attempts by experts and observers to manipulate the image to try to determine the exact structure of the payload section have produced inconclusive results. There is always the possibility that the original North Korean image may be fabricated, too. If the picture is legitimate, the shape does certainly have some very broad similarities to the hypersonic boost-glide vehicle on China’s DF-17 missile . It could also just be a very large maneuverable re-entry vehicle, or MaRV. Mockups of China’s DF-17 missile on parade in 2019., China Military Unpowered boost-glide vehicles, in general, use a rocket booster to get them to an optimal altitude and speed, after which the glider detaches and sails down toward its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5. These types of vehicles follow an atmospheric flight trajectory to their target and are typically characterized by a high degree of maneuverability. This combination of speed, maneuverability, and flight profile make them extremely challenging targets for air-defense networks to track and intercept, compared to traditional ballistic missiles, even ones with advanced MaRVs. This all reduces the time an opponent has to respond at all, including just to seek cover or otherwise relocate critical assets. A graphic showing, in a very rudimentary way, the difference in trajectories between a traditional ballistic missile and a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle., GAO A MaRV functions in a broadly similar way, but generally with much more limited maneuverability and still following largely a ballistic trajectory during the midcourse portion of its flight. They typically have the ability to “porpoise” or “skip-glide,” wherein they abruptly pull up at least once in the terminal stage of flight, creating one or more “steps” in the downward trajectory. This gives the warhead an irregular flight path and can be used to make basic course corrections, as well as offering a way to extend the overall range of the weapon and making it harder to intercept. A graphic associated with a Chinese short-range anti-ship ballistic missile showing a “porpoise” or “skip-glide” trajectory., Chinese internet There is no indication one way or another yet that the vehicle on top of the Hwasong-8, whatever its exact design, functioned as intended. The most basic hypersonic boost-glide vehicles are notoriously complex systems that would seem to be outside the technological capabilities of North Korea. The rocket motor configuration of the Hwasong-8’s first stage is also visible in the picture, showing a single large nozzle at the center and a number of smaller ones along the edges. All of the Hwasong series missiles are liquid-fueled designs. North Korean state media claimed this weapon had an improved “fuel capsule” with increased stability, which could indicate a design capable of remaining fueled for an extended period of time. Liquid rocket fuel is volatile and corrosive, making it hazardous to handle and limiting how long missiles that use it can generally remain in a fueled state. The need to fuel them before launch reduces their flexibility and can increase their vulnerability to hostile attacks. It is interesting to note that rocket motor arrangements similar to the one seen on the Hwasong-8 have been previously found on the Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). This raises the possibility that at least the first stage of the Hwasong-8 is related to one of those missiles. It is also worth pointing out that Mupyong Ri is where the Hwasong-14 was first test-launched from back in 2017 . Either of the Hwasong-12 or Hwasong-14 would offer an existing design capable of lifting very heavy novel warhead designs of various types. It is also worth noting that the North Koreans generally have the option of trading range for increased payload weight when designing missiles given the close proximity of their primary adversary, South Korea. In other words, an intermediate-range missile could potentially be adapted to carry a much larger payload over much shorter distances. The push to increasing warhead sizes on various missile systems has become a palpable reality between the North and the South as of late. Whatever the exact design of the Hwasong-8 is and whether or not this test was successful, it is yet another demonstration of North Korea’s ever-growing ballistic as well as cruise missile capabilities and its ambitions to develop new and improved designs. A clear desire on the part of Pyongyang to develop various means to defeat South Korean and American air and missile defenses has already been an obvious driver of many of these developments , and a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle or even a large MaRV would offer additional capabilities in this regard. The Hwasong-8 launch is also the latest in a series that the North and the South have conducted as part of a surging arms race between the two halves of the Korean Peninsula. This North Korean test came on the same day that a South Korean news outlet reported that that country’s Agency for Defense Development (ADD) had tested a new ballistic missile with a six-ton warhead and was working on another one with a seven-to-eight ton payload. In just the past two weeks, North Korea also tested a new ground-launched long-range cruise missile and rail-mobile ballistic-missile system . This month, South Korea revealed five of its own advanced missile developments, including a new submarine-launched ballistic missile , a “high-power” ground-launched ballistic, and supersonic anti-ship cruise missile. If North Korea follows past trends, the regime in Pyongyang is likely to release more official statements and imagery regarding this newly disclosed weapon soon, which will hopefully provide more opportunities to assess what its actual capabilities might be. Given how things on the Peninsula have gone recently, we may be looking at new missile-related disclosures from the South in the near future, as well. Updated 9/29/2021: A full official translation of the North Korean state media release regarding the test of the Hwasong-8 is now available. It offers some important details about the weapon’s claimed capabilities. “In the first test-launch, the defence scientists confirmed the navigational control and stability of the missile in the active section and its technical specifications including the guiding manoeuvrability and the gliding flight characteristics of the detached hypersonic gliding warhead,” it reads. “They also ascertained the stability of the engine as well as of missile fuel ampoule that has been introduced for the first time.” The release also highlighted “the strategic importance of the development of the hypersonic missile and its deployment for action, and the military significance of turning all missile fuel systems into ampoules.” Though North Korea’s claim that the Hwasong-8 incorporated improved liquid fuel rocket had already emerged, as we had discussed in our initial report, the specific mention of an “ampoule” is significant. The Soviets used this term, and the Russians still do, for missiles, such as the UR-100 ICBM , that are loaded with liquid fuel at the factory and then delivered in an encapsulated state that is very stable. If North Korea has truly developed this technology and can transition other liquid-fueled designs into “ampulized” configurations, it would significantly expand the flexibility of these weapons and reduce their vulnerability. It would just make them safer and easier to handle and deploy, in general, as well. The South Korean government has also given its first public assessment of the Hwasong-8. “Given the detected speed and other features of the ‘hypersonic missile’ North Korea said it test-fired yesterday, it appears to be at an early stage of development that would require considerable time for actual deployment,” a statement from the country’s Joint Chiefs of Staff read, according to Yonhap .

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 12, 2021",The Legendary Sidewinder Missile Made Its First Kill Over The Taiwan Strait (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no exaggeration to say that the appearance of the heat-seeking Sidewinder air-to-air missile transformed aerial warfare forever. The now-ubiquitous AIM-9 is still the short-range weapon of choice for most Western air arms, but how it came to be first proven in combat is less well known. It was over the Taiwan Strait, a region at least as tense in the 1950s as it is today, that the missile scored the first of its many kills, in dramatic clashes between Taiwanese and Communist Chinese jet fighters. Taiwan’s Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) obtained its first Sidewinders in 1958, at the height of the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, becoming the first foreign country to get its hands on them. As for the fascinating origin story of the Sidewinder in the early 1950s, that’s something that The War Zone has explored in the past, and you can read about it here . There’s no doubt that, from its modest beginnings, the missile — named after the heat-seeking rattlesnake of the Mojave Desert — quickly exceeded the expectations of its developers at the Naval Ordnance Test Station in China Lake, California. Nationalist Chinese pilots scramble to their F-86 jets on a Taiwanese airbase in 1958., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP What was unusual about the Sidewinder program was the fact it stressed simplicity over sophistication and was pioneered by a small team of Navy engineers rather than one of the big aerospace companies. The key was putting the seeker head in the missile itself, rather than trying to integrate it with a complex and bulky fire-control system on the aircraft launching it. The result was the first truly practical “fire and forget“ air-to-air missile. By 1953, infrared seeker heads had shown that they could track all manner of heat sources — trucks, trains, even glowing cigarettes — before proving their worth by blowing up unmanned B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and other aircraft that were converted into target drones. An AAM-N-7 Sidewinderfired from an F9F-8 Cougar hits an F6F-5K Hellcat drone over Naval Ordnance Test Station China Lake, California, in August 1957., U.S. NAVY Low-rate production of the Sidewinder followed in 1955, initially under the Navy designation AAM-N-7. It wasn’t until the revised tri-service system was introduced in 1963 that the Sidewinder became the AIM-9, the designation that it uses to this day. In the summer of 1958, the mounting tensions over the Taiwan Strait provided a first opportunity for the Sidewinder to be tested in combat. By this stage, the battle lines of the Taiwan confrontation had been established, with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) building up its forces on the mainland, while the Nationalists, forced out of the mainland, held out on Taiwan. At this time, the government in Taiwan was still widely recognized as the legitimate government of China, including within the United Nations, the country enjoying a status that has since notably diminished. Then as now, Taiwan was a recipient of U.S. military assistance, including the supply of combat aircraft, including F-86F Sabre jet fighters As well as Taiwan itself, the Nationalists occupied a pair of strategically located offshore islands, Quemoy, and Matsu, which were close enough to the mainland to serve as positions from which to bombard the PRC with artillery. In turn, the PRC attacked these islands, prompting the deployment of U.S. Navy aircraft carriers to the region in 1954. A contemporary Central Intelligence Agency map of Taiwan (Formosa) showing the locations of Quemoy and Matsu., U.S. Central Intelligence Agency As of 1958, the PRC was still building up its forces adjacent to Taiwan, while the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet patrolled the waters in the area. In July, a ROCAF F-86 was downed by a flight of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) MiG jet fighters. A month later, ROCAF reconnaissance flights revealed an increased deployment of PLA MiGs on airfields within reach of Taiwan. The aircraft comprised the first-generation MiG-15bis , the improved MiG-17F, and ultimately also the J-5, a Chinese-built version of the MiG-17. The situation escalated throughout the month of August, with the PLA launching an artillery bombardment of Quemoy, while ROCAF F-86s clashed with PLA MiGs over the Strait. A first MiG fell to the guns of a Nationalists Sabre on August 14. By the end of the month, the PRC was threatening an invasion of Taiwan. As well as the Nationalist forces, which included three wings of F-86s, there were four U.S. Navy carriers in the region by the end of August, while U.S. Air Force F-100 Super Sabres , a generation more advanced than the F-86s, was temporarily deployed to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base in Taiwan. Later in the year, U.S. Air Force F-104 Starfighters would be deployed to Taiwan, too, also armed with Sidewinders. A U.S. Air Force F-104A Starfighter of the 83rd Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Taoyuan Air Base, Taiwan, in September 1958., U.S. Air Force As the ROCAF stepped up patrols over the Strait, the clashes with PLA MiGs intensified. But the Soviet-made MiG-17 jets had an edge over the F-86s, with a higher service ceiling and higher maximum speed, and included an afterburner for extra thrust on demand. The result was that the Nationalist jets frequently failed to get within gun range of the Communist fighters. In response, the United States rushed the delivery of Sidewinder missiles to the Nationalists in August. With the weapon only just issued to the U.S. Navy, providing it to Taiwan so soon was a surprising move, seemingly driven by alarm at the appearance of the MiG-17, specifically. Modifying the Sabres to carry the missiles was not overly complex and was carried out under an operation apparently codenamed Black Magic. A poor-quality but rare color film still showing armorers load a Sidewinder missile on a ROCAF F-86 Sabre., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP There are accounts, too, suggesting that the ROCAF pilots practiced missile engagements by flying mock dogfights against U.S. Air Force F-100s replicating MiG-17s during dissimilar air combat training. The particular weapons supplied appear to have been AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IA missiles, which were the first version to be mass-produced, following the limited-production AAM-N-7 Sidewinder I, only around 200 of which were produced. After 1963, these two variants became the AIM-9A and AIM-9B, respectively. The Sidewinder IA had a maximum range of around three miles and was armed with a 10-pound blast-fragmentation warhead that provided an effective kill radius of approximately 30 feet. A U.S. Navy public relations photo showing a pilot next to an AAM-N-7 Sidewinder air-to-air missile in 1956., U.S. Navy A first successful Sidewinder engagement occurred on September 24, 1958, apparently over Quemoy, with accounts indicating that three more missile kills were achieved before the end of the day. In all, 10 MiGs were reported destroyed by ROCAF Sabres, the remainder being gun kills. According to accounts published in the West, 31 MiGs were shot down by ROCAF F-86s over a six-week period during the 1958 crisis, for the loss of two F-86s in return. This was part of a frantic pace of operations, in which the Nationalists flew between 100 and 200 sorties each day, with a similar number being flown on the PLA side. A preserved Shenyang J-5 — a Chinese license-built MiG-17 — at the Military Museum in Beijing., Morio/Wikimedia Commons Reports in the West suggest that the Nationalist pilots achieved a 60 percent kill rate using the Sidewinder over the Taiwan Strait. While they certainly had the element of surprise in their favor, that rate does seem high, particularly considering that more advanced models of the missile struggled to reach a 10 percent kill rate when employed by the U.S. Air Force over Vietnam. A ROCAF pilot prepares for a sortie in his F-86 Sabre in 1958., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Overall, the appearance of the Sidewinder had been a surprise for the PRC and for observers in general. There was a lucky windfall for the Communists, however, with at least one missile hitting a MiG-17, but not detonating. The jet returned to base where the missile wreckage was removed and later studied. That resulted in the reverse-engineered Vympel K-13 (AA-2 Atoll) in the Soviet Union and the license-built PL-2 equivalent in the PRC. Both these weapons had serious shortcomings in terms of capabilities, as did the early-generation Sidewinders, but they similarly provided a springboard toward much more practical designs. As for the Sidewinder’s role in the conclusion of the Taiwan Crisis in 1958, while it may have been a contributing factor, it was by no means the only one. The United States showed its commitment to Taiwan by resupplying Nationalist garrisons on both Quemoy and Matsu, helping to bring PRC bombardment to an end, although sporadic shelling would carry on for years to come. A U.S. Navy F4D-1 Skyray from Fighter Squadron VF-213, which served aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington that was deployed to the Western Pacific from July to December 1958. Note the Sidewinder IA missile carried under the wing., U.S. Navy The Sidewinder’s combat debut showed that the heat-seeking air-to-air missile was a viable proposition and, what’s more, it was even able to allow a lesser fighter to turn the tables on a better-performing adversary. The missile was far from perfect, however, especially in its initial iteration. Its range was short, and the limited reliability of its seeker head required clear skies with no distractions if it were to remain locked on a target’s exhaust. Only tail-chase engagements against non-maneuvering aircraft were possible, and the target was able to maneuver its way out of danger if alerted in time to the threat. The Taiwan Crisis of 1958 was just the first chapter in the Sidewinder’s combat history, and it would continue to be developed in the decades to come, as it continued to score victories in conflicts from Vietnam to the Falklands , and Desert Storm . Today, the AIM-9X Sidewinder is almost unrecognizable in its advanced abilities compared to its early progenitors. But the surprise appearance of this innovative weapon over the Taiwan Strait 63 years ago this month set the foundations for an unsurpassed career, one in which the latest iterations of the Sidewinder family remain the primary short-range missile armament of most Western fighters to this day. Update, September 29: Twitter user @alert5 has provided additional details about the combat of September 24, 1958, based on a Chinese-language report. This puts the location of the first Sidewinder shoot-down as Wenzhou Bay, PRC, rather than over Quemoy, a distance of around 120 miles away. The four F-86Fs had been flying top cover for an RF-84F reconnaissance jet. A gun-camera image of the action shows the missile streaking away from the F-86 before engaging the MiG-17, the contrails of which can be seen. The same account puts the number of MiG kills that day at nine, not 10, although only four fell to the new missiles, six of which were fired.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 21, 2021",Meet Israel’s ‘Suicide Squad’ of Self-Sacrificing Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When you first see Israel Aircraft Industries’ Harop drone, the “Star Trek” association is unmistakable. Like the Klingon Bird of Prey it resembles, the Harop is small, maneuverable, nearly impossible to detect, relatively inexpensive, and is downright deadly. And when it comes to accomplishing its mission, it even operates on the belief that “today is a great day to die.” The diminutive drone doesn’t carry any munitions; it doesn’t need to, because it is the munition . A 50-pound high explosive charge is part of the Harop itself, and if it finds an enemy radar or another target of opportunity in its vicinity, it will creep up, and once close enough, dive right into it, blowing itself and the target to bits in the process. Mission accomplished! Harop is primarily a Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) weapon system, used to neuter an enemy’s radio frequency-emitting sensor capabilities. Using drones to help destroy and confuse an unfriendly air defense network is something Israel knows a lot about, as they’ve been using them to do just that since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. During the conflict, the Israeli Air Force used Firebee and Chukar drones furnished by the US to distract, confuse, and stimulate enemy radar—much like the US had in Vietnam. The tactics helped blunt Israeli combat aircraft losses, and clearly, the IAF knew they were onto something. Following the Yom Kippur War, Israel began manufacturing their own simple unmanned aircraft, most of which had the same twin tail-boom configuration as many modern (and much larger) unmanned aircraft flying for the IAF today. But these were far simpler systems, with lower performance than the Chukars and Firebees used in combat in 1973. But what they lacked in performance they made up for in expendability and numbers. Harop drone on display at the 2013 Paris Air Show., Julian Herzog In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the IAF’s growing armada of unmanned aircraft was flying missions over Lebanon, surveying for Syrian air defense batteries and military emplacements. Some were shot down by the growing surface-to-air missile system network being installed by Syria in the region. But that didn’t matter, since the designs were built for high-risk and even one-way missions. In 1982, when open hostilities broke out in Lebanon, Israel put its drones to use on a massive scale. It was dubbed Operation Mole Cricket 19—the plan to rapidly eradicate Syrian air defenses in the Bekaa Valley. In just a matter of hours, it did just that. Israeli Mastiff drone, like the ones used during the Mole Cricket 19 operation., Bukvoed/wikicommons In the afternoon of June 9th, drone after drone flooded into the Lebanese airspace, acting as decoys that would bait Syrian air defenses into activating their radar systems. This allowed Israeli fighters to swoop in and launch anti-radiation missiles and direct attacks on the radar and/or surface-to-air missile sites, and get away unscathed. Scout and Mastiff drones were used in the highly technical and ground-breaking operation. It was the first time western hardware had totally eradicated a Soviet-designed and furnished integrated air defense network. Without radars, SAMs were useless and vulnerable to attack. Additionally, Syrian fighter pilots, trained under the Soviet doctrine that centered around direction from ground-based radar intercept controllers, were essentially blind. Selective jamming by the IDF of Syrian Air Force radio frequencies made them even more vulnerable. Israeli unmanned air vehicles were even stationed over Syrian airfields to watch as MiGs took to the skies. This information was immediately passed on to orbiting E-2C Hawkeyes that directed Israeli fighters to engage the emerging fighters. With Israeli F-15’s beyond-visual-range AIM-7 Sparrows, Syrian fighters could find themselves engaged without ever seeing their opponents. Additionally, the fact that Israel possessed AIM-9 Sidewinders with all-aspect targeting capabilities (i.e. not having to shoot an enemy from their rear quarter) meant many Syrian MiGs were essentially shot in the face at close range. It was a slaughter, and a cutting-edge technological combat opera for the world to see. In just the first day of operations, lasting just a few hours, 17 of the 19 SAM sites in and around the Bekaa Valley were obliterated and 29 Syrian tactical aircraft were swatted from the sky. As a result, the battle was dubbed the “Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot.” The incredibly lopsided and rapid victory proved the technological supremacy of western air combat over Soviet air defenses, and likely helped bring about the end of the Cold War. Lessons learned from the conflict also figured heavily into future American combat air operations. But above all, it proved the incredible utility of drones—not just for intelligence gathering in real time, but for their ability to assist in dismantling integrated air defense systems. With this success in mind, Israeli weapons manufacturers started tooling with the idea of completely eliminating the hunter-killer kill chain concept. In other words, instead of unmanned aircraft provoking enemy radars to activate, then sending their location to command and control who then vectors in fighters to engage the radars with expensive anti-radiation missiles and other precision guided munitions, just have the drone do it all autonomously. This was realized to a certain degree with existing drones that were modified for the mission in the years following the Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot, but by the 1990s, a small and stealthy “loitering munition” was being fielded just for this purpose—the IAI Harpy. The IAI Harpy on display at the Paris Air Show., Jastrow/wikicommons The Harpy was relatively tiny, with a wingspan of just under seven feet and packing a 38-hp rotary engine. But what it lacked in size the little flying-wing drone made up for in punching power, packing a 70-hp high-explosive warhead. On its nose was its most critical piece of equipment, a seeker head capable of detecting and homing in on certain radar frequencies. The idea was that a single truck could carry and launch dozens of Harpys to act as both bait and hook, flying to their predetermined target area where they would wait for enemy radars to come online. If that were to occur, the Harpy would fly right at the emitter, blowing itself up on arrival and taking the radar system with it. It was an ingenious and cost-effective weapon system, albeit a one-trick-pony and more of a fire-and-forget SEAD missile than a reusable unmanned aircraft with a propensity toward suicide. Still, the Harpy has been an export success, with India, Turkey, China, Chile, and South Korea buying the system in quantity. In the late 1990s, Israel began working on a follow-on to the Harpy. It would be a larger design that could be reconfigured for multiple uses, including attacking radars, providing both electronic and electro-optical intelligence, attacking targets of opportunity on the ground (say, vehicles). Plus, it could even be outfitted to come back home and be reused again. Harop, with its folding wings, can be launched from a truck- or ship-mounted canister, or configured for air-launch. Once in the air, it can be operated by man-in-the-loop control or it can go about its mission totally autonomously. Either way, it can put its warhead to use, using its camera system and operator to track and engage moving targets or its radiation-seeker to sniff out and attack radar sites on its own. It can even be equipped for both missions at the same time, so that if a radar site were to go offline after a Harpy detected it, it can fly to its location and use electro-optical targeting to locate and kill it. A huge difference between Harop and the Harpy is range and loitering time, with the modern iteration packing about double that of its simpler predecessor, or about 600 miles or six hours. That, plus the fact that it can be equipped to return home autonomously and land once its fuel runs low. The Harop being launched from a canister., IAI Basically, the Harop—which has the radar signature of a small bird and virtually no infrared signature whatsoever—offers an inexpensive solution for many unmanned missions in a small, transportable, and optionally reusable package. You can imagine that if you are the enemy, having dozens or even hundreds of these things roaming your countryside during a time of conflict would be pretty terrifying. In the suppression of enemy air defenses role, you can also imagine that just having a swarm of Harops decend into the area of operations before a major set of airstrikes would keep enemy radar operators from turning on their systems at all. In this case, the Harop accomplishes its mission without even having to destroy itself in the process. The Harop, like its progenitor, is already an export success, with India and Azerbaijan purchasing the system. In fact, it was put to use with devastating results by the Azeris just last spring, during fighting with the Armenians. The attack drone supposedly hit a bus full of soldiers , killing half a dozen of them in the process, and destroying the bus. This is what a real-world attack by a Harop looks like: https://youtube.com/watch?v=YmHCQg5sveA In many ways, Israel is far ahead of even the US when it comes to easily deployable “loitering attack munitions.” The American-made AeroVironment Switchblade , which is a small, man-portable loitering unmanned aircraft with attack capabilities, is in a whole different class than the far more advanced and strategically relevant Harop—or even the Harpy for that matter. In fact, Israel has its own version of this system, the ROTEM , and they even have another, larger system, the Green Dragon , that is also forward-deployed with troops, but with more capabilities and endurance. The truth is that all indicators point to a future where suicidal drones are the norm, not the exception. As such, a bull market is emerging around the concept. Even American domestic law enforcement has crossed over the robotic killer line . What’s really exciting—or terrifying, depending on how you look at it—is just what the Harop could be capable of if a large quantity of them were networked together as swarm . Using electronic and kinetic attacks, they could wreak havoc on an enemy’s integrated air defense system in a cooperative fashion. Projects like DARPA’s Gremlins aim to accomplish just that , and do it via airborne launch and recovery—although this is likely just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what is actually out there in the classified world. An artist rendering of DARPA’s Gremlins project. , DARPA In the meantime, Israel’s Harop will reign supreme as the most versatile suicide drone on the planet, and one that has already been used effectively in combat.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 30, 2020",New Diagram Details How The Navy’s Frigate Will Differ From Its Italian Parent’s Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. government report released earlier this month includes the best look to date at exactly how the U.S. Navy’s future Constellation- class frigates will differ from the Italian design from which they are derived. A core feature of this acquisition program, originally known as FFG(X), was the selection of a ship based on an existing, in-production warship in order to help keep costs and risks of delays low. It is now known that the Constellations will be longer and wider and displace hundreds of tons more than their “parent” design , among other changes in the hullform, superstructure, and internal configuration. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) released the latest edition of its report on the Constellation class on Sept. 15, 2021. It included an infographic, seen below, which the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs had supplied to CRS and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). That graphic has significant details about the dimensions and other features of this frigate design in comparison to that of the Italian subvariant of the Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate. FREMM began as a Franco-Italian program that produced a different subvariant for each country. Additional examples are now in service with the Egyptian and Moroccan navies. The Navy selected the FREMM-derived design, which will be built by Wisconsin-based Marinette Marine, a wholly-owned Fincantieri subsidiary in the United States, as the winner of the FFG(X) competition last year. An infographic that the US Navy provided to the Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office regarding differences between the Constellation class frigate design and its parent design., USN via CRS The infographic shows the “primary differences between the FFG 62 Class [design] and the FREMM Parent design,” the Navy said in an accompanying information paper, according to CRS. Compared to the Italian subvariant of the FREMM, the Constellation- class frigate is nearly 24 feet longer and just over three and a half feet wider along the waterline. The American warships are also expected to displace 518 metric tons more with a full load. “Hull lengthened … to accommodate larger generators and future growth,” the Navy’s graphic says. “Generator rating has been increased to support transit speed and future growth.” The greater displacement is linked to provisions made in the design from the very start to accommodate the integration of new and improved systems as time goes on, as well. It was already known that the Constellations would have a significantly different superstructure, with a much lower profile overall, based around the Navy’s requirements to integrate various U.S.-specific weapons and other systems, such as the AN/SPY-6(V)3 Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) and a version of the Aegis combat system . You can read more about what the expected capabilities of these frigates will be, as well as what new features they might be already set to gain in the future, such as directed-energy weapons that would require additional power generation, here . An artist’s conception of a Constellation- class frigate for the US Navy., Fincantieri Marine Group The Italian Navy’s FREMM frigate Carlo Bergamini ., FABIUS1975/WIKICOMMONS The Navy’s graphic also shows that the sonar dome found under the bow of the original FREMM design will not be found on the Constellations and that the propellers on the American warships will be “fixed pitch for improved acoustic performance.” The elimination of the sonar dome would indicate that the Navy has decided against a “low-band hull array,” which had been suggested as an option initially , in favor of the AN/SQS-62 variable-depth towed sonar array. The AN/SQS-62 is expected to be part of the still-in-development anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission module for the Navy’s two subclasses of littoral combat ships (LCS), as well. Perhaps most notably, the infographic says that “all differences shown were proposed by Fincantieri and incorporated into the [company’s] FFG(X) design prior to contract award.” This is significant given reports that emerged last month that indicated that the Navy had asked Fincantieri and Marinette Marine to enlarge the Constellation- class design after selecting it. “The Italians did a very good job in the design of the internal spaces, and the flow of a lot of those spaces,” Navy Captain Kevin Smith, the Constellation- class program manager, had said during a talk at the Navy’s League’s Sea Air Space conference on Aug. 2. “You could say we bought a bigger house, [but] from a modeling and simulation perspective, it’s exactly the same.” Those remarks had raised questions about the potential for cost growth or schedule delays due to significant changes in the ship’s design, despite the Navy’s touting the use of an existing, in-production design as a starting point. The information the Navy provided to CRS and CBO makes clear that this growth had occurred before the award of the initial FFG(X) contract. Whether the changes might still result in the ships being more expensive or more complicated to build remains to be seen, though the service has, so far, dismissed any such concerns . Artwork depicting a future Constellation- class frigate that the Navy released when it first selected the FREMM-derived design as the winner of the FFG(X) competition., USN It’s also worth noting that Navy “program officials stated they will complete the [ Constellation class] critical design review and production readiness review in summer 2021 to support construction start in October 2021, 9 months sooner than previously estimated,” according to an annual report assessing progress on various major U.S. military programs that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released in June . “The Navy said the updated schedule reflects the maturity of the ship design selected for the April 2020 award. Program officials noted they expect the Navy to review the basic and functional design for the ship’s 34 design zones prior to construction start, and for each major construction module, the shipbuilder plans to complete the detail design and construction drawings before starting the module’s construction.” The Navy has reportedly been considering the possibility of hiring a second shipyard to produce a batch of these frigates in the future to help prevent delays in delivery or even accelerate production, as well as support America’s shipbuilding industry. Right now, the service wants the first of the frigates, the future USS Constellation , to be delivered by 2026. In May, the Navy exercised an option under its existing contract with Fincantieri Marinette Marine to buy the second ship in this class, expected to be named USS Congress , but no target delivery date for this frigate has been made public yet. GAO says the Navy’s current plan is to reach initial operational capability with the type in 2029. The Navy’s contract with Fincantieri Marinette Marine also includes options for eight more ships. At present, the service’s goal is to buy at least 20, in total, in the coming years, but that number could easily grow. The Navy has made clear it is very interested in expanding and modernizing its fleets in recent years, driven in no small part by concerns about the continued growth of China’s naval capabilities . Congress looks set to add money to the Pentagon’s proposed defense budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year to buy more ships of various kinds, among other things. Regardless of how the Constellation- class program progresses from here on out, we now have a much better understanding of exactly how these ships will differ from the original FREMM design.

"Francesco ""Paco"" Chierici and Tyler Rogoway","Updated on Nov 17, 2021",Confessions Of A Navy F-14 Fleet Pilot Turned F-5 Aggressor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the first part of our two-part series on the high-flying adventures and in-cockpit experiences of Francesco “Paco” Chierici, he talked in-depth about flying Grumman A-6 Intruders during the twilight of the type’s service. In the second part, we get into Paco’s experiences, trials, and tribulations going from a ‘mud-mover’ to a dogfighter in the legendary F-14 Tomcat. Eventually, Paco would go from a Tomcat pilot to an F-5 adversary reserve pilot tasked with teaching fleet pilots how not to die in the highly unforgiving realm of air-to-air combat. But beyond the flying, we discuss so much more, from the U.S. military’s pilot shortage to dealing with the loss of comrades to becoming a documentary filmmaker and eventually an author. Paco’s Lions Of The Sky was recently released and he details below how the fictional story was ripped directly from the people, places, and experiences he had as a career Naval Aviator. ​ ​​​ So strap into the cockpit, arm your ejection seat, and light the burners as we blast off on a voyage into Paco’s colorful and action-packed past. From mud-moving to dogfighting I had experienced Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM, aka dogfighting) in the training command and fancied myself a natural. As an Intruder pilot, I would try to convince as many other pilots to fly a little BFM at the end of our bombing missions as often as possible. There is nothing quite as hideous as two Intruders trying to dogfight. My delusion was reinforced in the Tomcat RAG (Replacement Air Group training squadron), whereas a seasoned fleet pilot I was more comfortable being aggressive than my nugget classmates, but I knew nothing about how to really fight the jet. That fact was put on display numerous times when I finally got to my first F-14 fleet squadron, VF-213 Blacklions, and had numerous flights dedicated to air-to-air maneuvering. I got my butt handed to me by some of the best Tomcat pilots on the West Coast—Slammer Richardson, Stash Fristachi, Killer Killian, Whiskey Bond, and my roommate, Waylon Jennings. On one particularly humiliating flight from the Lincoln , a Hornet flown by Mousse savaged me on three successive engagements. But losing is the best teacher. I had come into the community with a love of aerial combat and I learned that the best dogfighters were made, not born. I read the Topgun manual, listened in the debriefs, and eventually crafted myself into a respectable BFMer. No Pappy Boyington , but serviceable. Of course, as good as I thought I was at the end of my Tomcat days, I was to soon find out how to really fight a plane once I became a Bandit. Life is a series of humiliations. USN The guy—or gal—in the back The synergy between pilot and crew member was crucial to the successful employment of both the A-6 and the F-14. A good crew working well together was a thing of beauty. Both platforms were relics of a previous age—bleeding edge when they were introduced, but hanging on at the ends of their eras when I flew them. What allowed them to compete with more modern aircraft was the proper execution of a crew concept. Of course, when the crews weren’t in sync, it was a frustrating and enormous shit show. To help maximize the crew’s performance, both communities endeavored to pair compatible crews and have them fly together as much as possible. During the course of normal turn-around ops this was difficult to accomplish. People had different schedules and priorities which made for a catch-as-catch-can environment. But during work-ups, or combat operations, there was a much higher effort put into flying with your designated crew-member. Working with a RIO in the Tomcat while fighting in the visual arena was totally binary. Either the pilot and the RIO bonded synergistically, fusing into a lethal team that enhanced situational awareness and weapons deployment, or they were a complete disaster. When the pilot and the RIO weren’t well suited for the specific dynamics of the visual arena, the result was a massive net-negative. If a RIO didn’t speak enough or spoke too much, the pilot wouldn’t get enough information to properly fight the plane while assessing the threat of the adversary aircraft. When it worked, it was amazing . When it didn’t, it was frustrating and at times, embarrassing. But it was nice to always have a RIO to blame! USN The Tomcat’s biggest arrow As most Tomcat aficionados are aware, the plane was built to employ the AIM-54 Phoenix missile. Originally designed for fleet defense against large and fast Soviet bombers, the Phoenix was massive in every way, and far ahead of its time. It weighed 1,000 pounds, was thirteen feet long, had a rocket motor burn time of over a minute, flew at Mach 5 and 80,000 feet, and delivered its 135-pound warhead to a target more than 100 miles away using its onboard radar in the end-game. A lethal sledgehammer of a missile. To effectively target this brute, an enormously powerful radar was required. To carry the giant radar dish and as many as six Phoenixes, Grumman designed a monster—the F-14 Tomcat—once it was clear that the F-111B failed in the role. Because the radar was so powerful and its dish so large, the AWG-9 was able to far exceed the detection, sorting, and targeting ranges of any other fighter in the world for decades. The AWG-9’s capabilities were a generational advance over its contemporaries, the F-4 and even the F-15. Through brilliant engineering and raw power, it was able to achieve results that we now take for granted in the most modern fighters—the once upon a time groundbreaking ability to simultaneously scan, target, and fire multiple missiles. USN One of my fondest memories of flying the Tomcat was the many missile shoots I was able to take part in. I shot AIM-9 Sidewinders at drones and a total of five Phoenix missiles over four separate events. The Sidewinder came off the rails screaming like a bottle rocket, finding its way to the target in an angry corkscrew. The Phoenix was so heavy it had to be dropped from the plane like a bomb before the motor could fire. At trigger squeeze you felt the Phoenix release from the jet with a distinct thump. About a second later, which is an eternity, the motor would light off and the AIM-54 would howl past the Tomcat from below, leaving a huge plume as it rocketed into the stratosphere. It would receive data from the Tomcat’s radar until it pitched over from 80,000 feet and closed on the target, then the RIO would cut it loose and the Phoenix’s on-board radar would consummate the deadly rendezvous. At close range the missile would aim directly at the target, flying a horizontal path, smoking all the way to fireball. It was a sight to behold, from the shooter’s vantage point. Despite being enormous and labor intensive to load, the Phoenix evolved with the times quite well. In most metrics, it could outperform the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The range, motor burn-time, warhead and on-board radar were no contest. The software and firmware were updated periodically allowing the missile to compete in the modern world. But like the Tomcat, it was a beast that was outperforming its design specifications a little past its shelf life. USN Making the big cat dogfight Though the Tomcat was technically a fighter plane, it wasn’t really designed for the visual BFM arena. It had a number of elements working against it when it came to dogfighting. First was its size, it was fondly referred to as the ‘Big Fighter,’ and it was huge . One of the basic tenants of aerial combat is, ‘lose sight, lose the fight.’ Against a Tomcat that was almost impossible. The A-model was also underpowered for maneuvering fights with an approximately 0.67:1 thrust to weight ratio. Furthermore, we had a 6.5 G limit, though there was no black box that would tell on you, so we often went well beyond 7 G. While it had massive elevators that would develop an incredible instantaneous pitch rate, the lack of ailerons and the sheer width of the plane made the roll rate sluggish. Finally, the ergonomics of the cockpit were designed in the late ‘60s. There was no HOTAS (Hands On Throttles and Stick). The BVR intercept was run by the RIO in the back manipulating the radar and working with the pilot. Once the merge was imminent, inside 10 nautical miles, the pilot took over. But he would still have to call for the RIO to engage the dogfight mode of the radar. USN Despite these massive deficiencies, the Tomcat, in the hands of a skilled pilot flying with a good RIO, could be quite lethal in the visual arena. Especially if it had the General Electric motors. In a two-circle fight, where degrees of turn per second are a premium, the Tomcat was quite adept. But if you got the A-model slow, into the ‘black hole’ around 250 knots, you were stuck in a region the plane did not excel in. The TF-30 engines just didn’t have enough grunt to allow the plane to fly extremely slowly, nor to power back up to proper maneuvering speed. The GE engines, on the other hand, enabled a skilled pilot to work the slow speed environment successfully. A very good pilot could even pirouette the plane using the GE engines by bringing one out of afterburner. The Tomcat would swap ends gracefully and reverse course instantly. The auto function of the wing sweep could work against a pilot in the BFM arena as well. The angle of the sweep was a function of a variety of factors, including speed, angle of attack, and altitude. F-15s liked to drag the Tomcat high and use their superior thrust to gain an advantage. An off-the-books tactic we used to counter this was to manually extend the wings to the fullest, then incrementally lower the flaps beyond the normal maneuver setting. It was hugely successful, but the danger was that the flap torque tubes were not designed for this and could become stuck. Life is all about tradeoffs, and not losing to an F-15 is certainly worth the ire of the maintenance Master Chief. I flew BFM against a variety of dissimilar aircraft as a Tomcat pilot. During a memorable week off the coast of Pakistan we flew a number of BFM and BVR sorties against the Pakistani Air Force. I still have some spectacular HUD footage from engagements against MiG-21s (J-7s). I remember being amazed at the lack of proficiency and proper weapons employment from their F-16 pilots. When we were in the Persian Gulf, we had a week where we fought the Emirati Mirage 2000-5 pilots. They were actually quite aggressive pilots who displayed a keen awareness of the tactics to employ against the weaknesses of the F-14A. They would jam to the merge, then pull 9Gs, flying so high we almost lost sight. If we did, they would tag us with a heater (infrared short-range guided missile). But if you could survive the first merge to employ follow-on BFM, they became easy prey. Probably the single best BFM platform I ever flew against was the F-16N. Stripped down and slicked up, it was a dogfighting monster, virtually unbeatable. Editor’s note: Read all about the Navy’s infamous F-16N and what it was like to fly it in this past special feature of ours. I once had a friend in a Topgun Viper park himself a couple thousand feet on my nose when I was flying a slick F-5. I counted down “3, 2, 1 Fight’s on!” and tried my damnedest to stay offensive. Inside of 270 degrees of turn, the Viper came nose on and was gunning me. It was eye-watering performance. Culture shock In the summer of 1990, I had been stashed at NAS Miramar just after completing flight school. I was assigned to VFC-13, the adversary squadron, while I waited for a training slot for the A-6 at NAS Whidbey Island in Washington State. Miramar was at the peak of the post- Top Gun sugar rush. The O’Club on a Wednesday night was like what I imagine Studio 54 was like in the ‘70s. There was an hour-long line to get on base and go to the Club. It was so profitable for the base that they built a separate entrance through the perimeter fence directly into the back entrance of the Club. Thursday mornings were hell. NAS Whidbey Island was a markedly different cultural scene. No one drove the hour and a half from Seattle to party at the Whidbey O’Club on a Friday night. But that actually made for a very tight community. We shared the base and the Friday night happy hours with the Prowler community as well. While Whidbey didn’t have wall to wall revelers and live music, most of the aviators on base could be found at the club drinking together. My favorite pastime was playing a dice game called Klondike. On a big night just before a few squadrons were leaving on cruise, the pot could quickly balloon to a few thousand dollars. There was nothing like leaving for six months to make gambling with huge piles of cash seem like a good idea. USN Being the FNG I was a new guy in three different fleet squadrons and one reserve squadron. Each of these had a distinct culture which greeted the FNG (Fucking New Guy) slightly differently. My first was an Intruder squadron which I joined the day of their victorious fly-in returning from the Iraq War I in ’91. I was joining a group which had been to war together and done great deeds under tremendous stress. They hadn’t had a new pilot in a very long time and I was replacing one whom they had lost, along with his B/N during combat ops. It wasn’t a very warm reception. They were justifiably proud of their accomplishments and not super accepting of a bright, bushy-tailed new dude, who undoubtedly wasn’t as good as he thought he was. It took a good six months to break into the brotherhood. The next few squadrons I joined had a much more accepting culture. When I joined VF-213, my Tomcat squadron, it was as a fleet experienced aviator with many hundreds of hours, a few hundred carrier traps, and I was a fully qualified LSO (Landing Signal Officer). They were a very easy group to join and I felt accepted immediately. It helped that I had a fair amount to offer, I jumped right back to LSO duties, and the Lions were eager to learn how to employ the F-14 as a ‘Bombcat.’ But despite my eagerness to be a fighter pilot, I was a complete neophyte in the world of air-to-air combat, and it was obvious. The Lions took great care training me and the other new crews and we always felt valued and encouraged, so much as these emotions are possible in a cutthroat fighter squadron. USN Black cats VF-213 almost changed their name from the Blacklions shortly after I arrived. To some, she was a cursed squadron and the black cat logo was as good a scapegoat as anything else. The Lions had lost a number of planes due to a variety of causes in the years prior to my arrival. Tomcats hit the ramp of the ship during landing, stalled in the overhead break, exploded in mid-air for no apparent reason. There seemed to be no common thread unifying the mishaps, so straws were grasped at, including changing the famed Blacklion logo. Thankfully that wasn’t a remedy that was pursued. When I got to 213, the mishaps continued. In fact, during my two years in Air Wing Eleven, the entire Wing lost nine jets and had six fatalities. Four of the lost planes were Tomcats and three of the deaths were in them. It was a jumpy time. As one of my friends, HOB Higgins, said, we felt like cats in a room full of rocking chairs.  Shortly after I joined 213 we lost Kara Hultgreen while she was attempting to land on the Lincoln . I had known Kara briefly in the Training Command. Kara Hultgreen., YouTube Screencap We both had Alfa Romeo convertibles and we laughed about the spotty reliability and repair costs of the Italian sports cars. She was the perfect ‘fighter-chic,’ quick with a smile, fun to be around, sharp-witted, and not afraid to stand her ground. She folded herself into the fabric of the Blacklions seamlessly and was warmly regarded as part of the ‘pride.’ The treatment she received after her death has always stayed with me as one of the greatest injustices witnessed during my naval career. Our XO replicated the mishap 100 times in the simulator and crashed 97 of them. At the time of her death, she was a pack-player behind the boat, meaning that she was solidly in the middle of the squadron’s landing grades. Yet, as one of the first woman to fly Tomcats in the fleet, and the first to die doing so, she was held as an example of the supposed error of women in combat. It hurt to see her sacrifice used in such a vicious manner, especially since her death had nothing to do with her gender. Kara was an inspiration for the female character of my novel, Lions of the Sky . I began with the question, “What would Kara’s journey had looked like had she lived?” My character, Keely Silvers, is the embodiment of Kara’s fighter spirit—tough, funny, a natural pilot, and ultimately, someone to be reckoned with. USN The hardest tactic to master Death and disaster are a dark reality of military aviation. Despite all of the emphasis on safety and training rules, the environment is unforgiving and the penalty for error is swift and deadly. I flew for 20-years and lost more than 20 friends and comrades. The list of reasons for the mishaps was dizzying: mid-air collisions, maintenance errors, G induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC), impacting the earth, and a few more. After every mishap, we had to both grieve and disassociate ourselves. It was a battle of opposing emotional efforts. On the one hand, we would hold a memorial ceremony, complete with missing man flyby. They were all gut-wrenching affairs which forced you to confront your mortality and hold loved-ones close. Then, often hours later, it was time to get right back on the horse, back into the very same environment, the same missions, the same planes that had just taken your buddy’s life. To do that required a conscious act of delusion. Forcing fear, trepidation, uncertainty into a box and shelving them in a storage bunker deep in the back of your mind. The pilots I knew who perished spanned the spectrum of skill level, from the best I ever saw, to some who were not very good. The Grim Reaper didn’t distinguish. We convinced ourselves that we weren’t next, that the bullet wouldn’t be in the next chamber during our aerial game of Russian Roulette. My last two years on active duty our air wing lost nine airplanes and six people. It seemed like every two months there was an ELT sounding off alerting us to yet another mishap. I didn’t realize how much strain it put on me until I left. After a couple of months away I slept much better and felt much lighter in spirit. But flying pointy nosed jets, pulling Gs, and burning jet fuel are as addicting as it gets. Within a few more months I was back in the air, getting my fix with the reserves, and loving every minute because I knew I wasn’t next. Missing Man formationo of the Big John., USN Back over Iraq My second cruise over the ‘sandbox,’ as Iraq was referred to, was enhanced by flying a different airframe in a different community. It wasn’t quite the same stuff, different day. I had a lot to learn about my new plane and a much different mission to master. We had three basic missions flying the F-14 over Iraq during Southern Watch: reconnaissance, strike, and air superiority. I enjoyed the variety of missions. The reconnaissance missions required flying with a TARPS (Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System), which we fondly referred to as ‘The Turd.” The pod weighed roughly two-thousand pounds and was hung towards the rear of the Tomcat. It affected the center of gravity and thus the handling characteristics of the plane. More importantly, it reduced the amount of fuel available to land aboard the ship. I always enjoyed the added responsibility of the pressure to get good pictures and the fact that I only had one look at the boat before I was fuel critical. One of the three cameras on the TARPS pod aimed at a forty-five-degree angle. We would frequently skirt the Iraqi border while flying along the Tigris River to obtain imagery of Iranian naval bases. Once, while flying a profile I had flown dozens of times prior, safely—if barely—in Iraqi airspace, an Iranian controller came up on the emergency frequency and warned me to leave. He followed by saying that if I did not leave, I was in danger of intercept by the Iranian air force. Before the RIO could answer I jumped on the radio and made sure he knew we would welcome any Iranian jet that wanted to come up and play. It would have been the coolest thing in the world to do a 1v1 against an Iranian F-14. Sadly, it was an empty threat. We did a quick lap, eagerly looking for a jet to tangle with, but no one showed up. USN The strike missions we flew were similar to the missions I had flown in the Intruder. Occasionally we would plan missions against specific targets scattered across Iraq, then fly practice strikes against them as we patrolled southern Iraq below the no-fly zone. Other times we would fly to a predetermined box and check in with a ground controller for tasking. During my cruise, we never received any, we just orbited at the ready. One of the more interesting missions we flew was to escort for the U-2s that flew parallel to the 33rd parallel that defined the southern border of the no-fly zone. Iraqi jets were permitted to operate between the 32nd and 33rd parallels in a narrow band of air space. The rules of engagement prevented us from engaging with the Iraqis so long as they stayed in their box, but if a MiG penetrated south of the 33rd, then it was fair game—the rules allowed us to chase it down. The Iraqis often played a game of chicken, flying their MiG-25s south at high speed then turning them away at the last moment, avoiding triggering the line of death. The AWACS would alert us of the threat and we would commit toward the target, arming up the missiles in case shit got real. While it never happened to me, it was always cause to spike the adrenaline system and ultimately a whole lot more fun than burning another hole in the sky. When we took on the tasking to escort the U-2s however, the threat became much more real.  The U-2 flies at extremely high altitude, though well within missile range of the AA-6 air-to-air missiles the super-fast MiG-25 Foxbats carried. We took the threat to the vulnerable U-2s very seriously and took it upon ourselves to devise a plan that would allow us to protect the pilots from an Iraqi jet that wanted to take a shot. The challenge was that the U-2 flew far higher and much slower than the Tomcats. One of our RIOs, Smash Kormash, devised a zig-zag flight path where we could fly below the U-2s while maintaining our slowest tactical speed. While they flew their missions oblivious to us, we were flying a long, jinking pattern below, keeping our knots up in the event a Foxbat showed any interest. Paco refueling from a KC-10 in his F-14., USN RIMPAC Rim Of The Pacific (RIMPAC) ’96 was my last at sea period with the Tomcat, VF-213, and Air Wing Eleven. It was a bittersweet three-month mini-deployment for me. I felt at the top of my game, yet I was just a few months from leaving active duty for whatever lay beyond. As an Air Wing, the involvement of the dozen or so foreign ships was largely transparent to our operations. The only time we noticed anything unusual was on the occasion when our practice intercepts were controlled by someone with an Australian, or Spanish, or Japanese accent.  There were no foreign navy air assets that we wrangled with, so the international aspect of the exercise was no factor for the aviators. All of that changed on the night of June 3rd. The USS Independence was operating in RIMPAC along with the USS Kitty Hawk , which Air Wing Eleven had transitioned to. One of the A-6s from VA-115, attached to Air Wing Five, was towing a target on an extremely long cable. The target was to be fired upon by a Japanese destroyer, the JDS Yuugiri , with her Mk15 Phalanx 20mm CIWS. As the Intruder flew past, the Yuugiri armed her gun far too soon. The CIWS performed as advertised, immediately shooting the A-6 out of the sky. Fortunately, both crew members ejected safely, though they never quite lived down being the first US plane shot down by the Japanese since World War II. Phalanx firing at a target during live-fire training., USN Grumman reliability through raw dedication I was lucky in that I caught both the A-6 and the F-14 during good cycles of their maintenance and reliability. Ironically, I believe it was due to the fact that they were both near the ends of their service lives. As I mentioned earlier, shortly after I checked into VA-155 as an A-6 Intruder pilot, we began receiving brand new jets with as little as ten hours on the airframes. The old jets they were replacing had been depressing to fly. Wing crack issues kept us to below 4 Gs, which sucked badly. Having a brief taste of a jet that was barely hanging on gave us an appreciation for the new Intruders we received. We flew the hell out of them, though, knowing the squadron was to be decommissioned when we returned from cruise. I had much the same experience when I was in VF-213. The squadron had experienced so many bizarre mishaps over its recent past that we got the best of everything. The best A models (a dubious claim), the best maintainers, an amazing maintenance Master Chief (Hulbert), and priority for parts. The maintainers were determined not to be a factor in any future mishaps and the jets were groomed to perfection. USN On my last cruise I was the Avionics and Armament Division Officer, responsible for the majority of the maintainers. It was a great opportunity to observe them as they worked the jets and I could not have been more impressed. Unbelievable intelligent and hardworking young men and women working twelve-hour shifts in the blazing heat and stifling humidity of the Persian Gulf.  Not once during that deployment did I miss a sortie, which is unheard of. There was a launch where I came close, however. I had a Central Air Data Computer (CADC) issue that we discovered just after engine start. The CADC was vital to making the complex wing sweep mechanism work in the Tomcat. It was a hundred-pound box just behind the cockpit under a panel with dozens of fasteners. It wasn’t a difficult fix to swap it out, but it took time and effort. When the mechanic informed me of the problem, I knew I was going to miss the launch. We only had ten minutes. But he said, “Don’t worry, sir. I’ll get you going. Hang tight.” I watched as he pulled the massive box and scrambled down my ladder, hustling across the flight deck in 130-degree midday heat. I knew he had to lug that box down three flights of ladders to his shop, grab a new one and lug it back up. With minutes to spare before the Air Boss canceled me, I saw him labor back across the deck, up my ladder, and onto the back of the jet. The box was inserted and checked, the panel was refastened, and we were ready to go with barely a moment to spare. I was deeply moved by that commitment, then, and now. It was an impressive display of dedication and professionalism and I have never forgotten it. USN Qualifying Carriers I had the great privilege to deploy on the Forrestal class USS Ranger (CV-61), the nuclear-powered Nimitz class U SS Lincoln (CVN-72), and the first-in-class USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63), getting over 100 traps aboard each. They all hold a special place in my memory and were distinctive in surprising ways. I am glad I served aboard the Ranger first, as she was the smallest and oldest. Despite her age, and the fact that I was on her for her very last cruise, she was a very well-maintained ship. I remember distinctly that Ranger and Air Wing Two were a fantastic pairing. You could set your watch by the sound of the first catapult shot of a scheduled launch. It was the kind of precision the ship’s company took great pride in and it was reflected in every aspect. The dirty-shirt wardroom, where the aviators ate, was arranged differently than other carriers. It was a subtle, but significant variation in that the tables were only 4-tops, like in most restaurants. Other carriers had massive picnic-style tables that could seat 20 or more. Squadrons would have tablecloths made with their logos, staking out territory. This tended to divide the wardroom, where aviators felt compelled to eat at their squadron table even if they were alone. On Ranger you generally ate with whomever you were in line with, regardless of squadron. The result was a much tighter Air Wing where all the aviators knew each other, reducing parochialism and enhancing camaraderie. USS Ranger with her ‘Grumman Air Wing’ deployed in the 1990s., USN The best part about cruising on Ranger’s last cruise was being able to modify the living quarters with impunity. We knew the ship was to be decommissioned right when we returned. That gave us a sense of liberty when it came to some major modifications which weren’t possible on a ship that would be carefully scrutinized during a turnaround period. One threesome of Lieutenant Commanders took possession of a 6-man bunk room. They saved half of the bunks, desks, and wardrobes, then cleaned out the other half, chucking it all overboard one night. It left a huge empty space, which was an unknown luxury on a warship. Despite the fact that a carrier is an enormous 1,100-foot long ship, it is illusory when it comes to space inside. 5,000 people are crammed into that tiny real estate and there is no room at all for comfort or lounging—except for in this one room on Ranger . The guys filled that empty space with carpeting, a poker table, couches and lounge chairs, an awesome poker lamp, and they finished it up by covering the drab gray walls with fake wood tack paper. It was an incredible space to congregate, drink some illicit beverages, and play poker deep into the night. The downside of the Ranger was that she was a conventionally powered ship. That meant that she didn’t have unlimited fresh water for ‘Hollywood’ (long) showers or air conditioning. USS Abraham Lincoln approaching its new home port of Everett, Washington in 1996. , USN The Lincoln , my second home away from home, is the only ship I served on still in service. As a nuke, she was able to pump frigid air into all the spaces even in the miserable heat of the Persian Gulf. You may laugh, but that was a major enhancement to the quality of life. She was also able to make unlimited fresh water. Despite that, she had the same spring-loaded hand-held shower nozzles as all the conventional boats. We easily bypassed that restriction with a three-inch C-clamp, which we would affix to the shower head to hold down that damn button. With that minor mod, we were able to enjoy an almost normal shower after coming back from a six-hour mission over Iraq—a luxury we thought we absolutely deserved. The Kitty Hawk was the ship I spent the least amount of time aboard, just half a work-up and a RIMPAC. I don’t remember too much about her other that she was definitely my least favorite.  She wasn’t as clean or well run as Ranger and she wasn’t shiny and new as Lincoln . We took to calling her ‘Shitty Kitty,’ probably because we were a little bitter about the crap air conditioning again. It doesn’t take much to make an aviator bitch. USS Kitty Hawk steaming to Hawaii in the 1990s., USN Sainthood Once I left active duty, I joined the airlines as a commercial pilot. It was a good decision for family reasons, but after a few months, I found myself missing the smell of jet exhaust and the sensation of pulling Gs. I was extremely lucky in that a good friend of mine from 213 had joined VFC-13 at NAS Fallon as an active duty pilot. He called me and told me they were forming a selection board to screen for new reserve pilots. I couldn’t put my package together fast enough. I was selected and began flying a few months later and I couldn’t have been happier. Flying pointy nosed, afterburning fighters was still in my blood and I was thrilled to get some more hits at the JP-5 crack pipe. The Adversary syllabus at the Saints (VFC-13) was extremely rigorous. As I mentioned earlier, when I left the F-14 I felt I was a pretty good fighter pilot. Once I began the syllabus with the Saints, I quickly learned I was still a neophyte. These guys were amazing pilots who were also able to recall each instance of each engagement. It was mind-blowing. Despite having only 15 hops, the syllabus took anywhere from nine months to a year to complete. The standard was perfection and the norm was multiple re-flys. I was so happy to finally complete the training and join the squadron as a basic adversary pilot. Despite the fact I was flying pointy nosed jets and wearing a flight suit, it was obvious we weren’t an active duty squadron. About a third of the pilots were still on active duty, assigned to the Saints for administration and continuity. A few more were full-time reservists, called Selective Reservists. The rest of us were airline pilots who came in seven to ten days a month. The core of the unit stayed together for the whole ten years I was there, which made for a very tightly knit group. But we spent most of the time scattered across the country living with our families and working our real jobs. In a fleet squadron, it was the opposite, you spent the vast majority of your time with your squadron mates and at work, they were your de facto family.  Your spouse and kids got what was left over on the occasion you were at home. I left active duty for family reasons and I’m glad I did. But the closeness of a fleet squadron is something I’ll remember fondly as long as I live. Paco inspecting an F-5 before a flight out of NAS Fallon., Courtesy of Paco From Tomcats to Tigers There were some major aspects of moving to the F-5 from the mighty Tomcat. The most obvious were size and a single-seat cockpit. The Tomcat usually took to the sky at around 65,000 pounds. It was 63 feet long and 64 feet wide. The F-5 weighed around 15,000 pounds in the max configuration we flew her in, with a single centerline drop tank—less than the Tomcat’s fuel load alone. The Tiger was 47 feet long and 26 wide—a lawn dart compared to the Big Fighter. The Tomcat pilot famously had a RIO for the pilot to blame for all his errors, while in the F-5 you had to rely on a bad wingman to suck up the critique. The cockpit in the Tomcat was huge, lots of room for limbs and noggin. Strapping into the F-5 was akin to putting on your last piece of flight gear. It became a part of you. It was so tight in that cockpit that I couldn’t straighten out my legs or sit completely straight.  If I had been forced to eject, I’m sure I would have suffered some negative consequences. The Tomcat was so fun to fly, it was like a muscle car, a ’65 Shelby Cobra. Lots of power, even in the A model, a sense of weight behind the controls, it buffeted under G, bucking and straining through the turns. The F-5 was like a go-kart. Underpowered but light in the controls and nimble as all hell. It could do two aileron rolls per second. F-5N of VFC-13 landing at NAS Fallon., USN The Tomcat was a fleet bird, built to carry missiles and bombs into combat. She had so much drag that when you were supersonic and came out of burner it felt as though you were slamming on the brakes. The Tiger was clean, just an AIM-9 and a telemetry pod on the wingtips, and occasionally a centerline fuel tank. She slipped through the ‘number’ (Mach 1) easily. They were both jets from the same era, but the Tomcat was a warfighter, bristling with equipment meant to find and destroy the enemy and survive the encounter. Radar, RWR gear, chaff and flares, IFF, TCS, and much more. The aviators had to be proficient with all of the equipment, using as many as possible on each mission. The F-5 was a pair of engines and wings. It was so simple and it was perfect for reservists. All we had to do after a few weeks away was come back for one warm-up flight and we were ready to rock. The F-5Ns the squadron received from the Swiss starting in 2005 were a bit more complex, sporting anti-skid brakes, basic pulse radar, RWR gear, and an INS (inertial navigation system). But it was an incremental upgrade, still basic when compared to the fleet birds. It was a pleasure to jump into the F-5 and go fight, whether it was the professional adversary mission we provided to the fleet, or the in-house 1v1s we loved more than anything. But it could never match the adrenaline rush of flying the Big Fighter from the boat. Each and every launch was like suiting up for the ‘Big Game.’ The Tomcat absolutely dwarfs the svelte F-5. , US Navy via National Archives Tiger trick Air-to-air fighting doesn’t require crazy maneuvering. It isn’t about who can do the wildest stunt to gain an advantage or who has a secret trick up his sleeve only pulled out when needed to get that last-ditch advantage. Real dogfighting isn’t like in the movie Top Gun— hitting the brakes and he’ll fly right by.  The best fighter pilots are masters of their plane. It is an extension of their bodies and minds. They are able to fly it to the absolute edge of performance, whether that is a rating high G two-circle fight, or a one-circle fight where nose position is key—as well as myriad permutations and variations in between, such as rolling and flat scissors. It is as much an intellectual challenge as a physical one, where creativity meshes with integrally with skill. The best pilots I saw were able to think three merges ahead and set up their opponent for the weapon of their choice. It was a thrill to experience, even from the wrong end of the kill shot. That said, there were some fighter pilots who were just a whole level above the rest in their stick and rudder skills. One of the best at a specific ‘move’ was a friend and squadron mate in VFC-13. Memo could swap ends in an F-5 more perfectly than I believed possible. Somehow, when he was defensive in the vertical, he was able to pirouette the Tiger in a manner that reversed his course and still afforded him airspeed to continue maneuvering. I witnessed it many times while nipping at his heels over the Nevada skies. Sure, I was just moments away from a guns kill, then he would snap the jet impossible fast and pass me close aboard going the opposite direction. He tried in vain to teach it to me. I could come close. I could swap direction and end up slow, or I could mush through a turn and keep some knots on the jet, but I could never get the right combination of both. It still pisses me off. Editor’s note: You can read more about what it is like putting the F-5 to work as an adversary in this past special feature of ours. A colorful formation of VFC-13 F-5s. , Tyler Rogoway/Author Forever F-5 The F-5 has lived many lives and is on the verge of yet another. It began in the ‘60s as a basic fighter/bomber we could sell to allies who couldn’t afford top of the line fighters. It excelled at that mission. It has been continuously updated to meet the requirements of the evolving battlespace. Aerodynamically, the F-5 will always be what we call a category 3 fighter, where the F-35 and F-22 are now category 5 fighters. Compared to modern jets, it is underpowered, slow, and bleeds airspeed badly in a sustained turn, not to mention it has no stealth other than its tiny size. But with just a few modifications, the F-5 is being turned into a threat plane with a legitimate sting. The newest upgrades include an AESA radar, good RWR gear, chaff and flares, a jamming pod, and a helmet mounted cueing system for a high off-boresight IR (infrared-guided) missiles. A Tiger so outfitted can provide Super Hornets and F-35s a legitimate threat, especially in the training environment. One of the aspects of the Tiger as an adversary platform that has served it well across the decades is that if you are a Blue fighter and you lose to an F-5, there is a definite error you made. A decisive training moment that can be isolated and debriefed and remembered, so that the same mistake will not be made in combat. TacAir just won a Navy contract to support the adversary mission at NAS Fallon alongside VFC-13. Their F-5s will be the most advanced F-5 aggressors ever put in the air. Read all about these aircraft in this previous feature of ours. , TacAir It’s your captain speaking… Stepping into the cockpit of a 737 after flying F-14s and F-5s is like stepping into a different skin. The person and the mindset you have as a fighter pilot and the manner in which you fly the plane are diametrically opposed to the style of piloting required to be a good airline pilot. A good flight in a fighter involved lots of sweating and action, high Gs, close passes against another plane with a thousand knots of closure and aggressive, in-close maneuvering. A good flight in an airliner in one where the passengers feel as if they are enjoying a nice cocktail in their living room and just happen to be whizzing across the continent at 500 knots. Maybe a movie and a nap—certainly nothing exciting. And that’s ok. That’s the way it should be. That is why I fly Yak-50s on the weekend while some of my friends are on the golf course. I still get to go up and pull Gs and dogfight against other fiends, but now it’s in propeller planes and we have to pay for our own gas! Socially, in the cockpit, the worst kind of airline pilot to fly with is the former military jet jock who tries to hang on to the glory of his former life. We get fantastic training from our company on how they want us to fly the airliners, there’s no need to bring up war stories from your fighter days. All the pilots in an airliner cockpit here in the U.S. are exceptionally qualified to fly commercial planes, whether we came up flying canceled checks in a Cessna 172 in the middle of the night or were blasted from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf. Where have all the pilot’s gone? It has always amazed me how poorly the Navy treated its aviators. Even during the best of times, we had to battle the establishment to maintain our distinct identity and esprit de corps. The relentless tide of bullshit that the administrators threw at us demanded a constant self-evaluation—do I really love flying these jets so much that I’m going to put up with this crap? The stark reality is that a carrier costs $12 billion. Add a few billion more for the requisite ships and now you’ve got a Carrier Strike Group, the basic war-fighting unit of the modern Navy. Add a few billion more and you can arm that strike group with purpose, the seventy-odd planes and helicopters required to outfit the Air Wing that embarks on the carrier. The many billions in ships and aircraft exist for one purpose, to project power against the enemy from nearly any place in the world. The 11 (counting the impending arrival of the Ford ) carriers and their associated Strike Groups are the most lethal offensive weapon the world has ever seen. Yet they exist almost entirely for the deployment of the 150 or so aviators that will fly the jets and helicopters into harm’s way. Recent studies have determined that it costs $6-11 million and five years to fully train a front-line combat aviator. In any other environment in the world, the asset that provided the highest value and costs the most to replace would be considered a prime asset. But in the US military, combat pilots are treated like crap and subjected to harassment from senior ranking support personnel. The misalignment of interests is grating during the best of times, but when the airlines begin to hire after many years of drought, the frustration finds a ready expression in the form of an exodus. Paco with his VFC-13 brothers. Paco served in the squadron for a decade as a Reservist. , Courtesy of Paco In the last five years the Navy and Air Force have lost billions in highly trained aviators to a profession they are severely overqualified for because they couldn’t take the bullshit anymore. Most of us would have continued in the military for a fraction of our airline salaries if only they hadn’t squeezed the fun from the most fun job you could ever have. The resulting pilot shortage in the military is no shock to those of us who served. But it has helped to create a new, unforeseen industry— contract adversaries . Back in my day, when you needed someone to play the red fighter—the bad guy—you simply scheduled an in-house asset to that role. So, an F-14 squadron scheduling a 2v2 sortie would need four Tomcats. We thought nothing of it as the planes, parts, aviators, flight hours, and fuel were plentiful. Today none of those parameters are true. Now factor in that the dramatically improved capabilities of fifth-generation fighters mean fewer planes are required, and thus fewer planes are on the flight line, and now you have a training issue. Fast forward a few years and we now have at least four major players in the contract adversary space. They have a corral full of former fighter pilots, frustrated airline pilots, who are happy to fly pointy-nosed crack pipes for relatively low salaries. There is a glut of third generation fighters on the world market – Mirage F-1s , F-5s , A-4s – that are being upgraded with AESA radars, top line RWR gear, jamming pods, and other fifth generation toys, making them capable adversaries to F-35s and F-22s and a fraction of the hull costs. The Department of Defense is thrilled it doesn’t have to pay for any of the assets or personnel, they merely manage the requirements and demand high standards. The contract adversaries are staffed with former Topgun and Weapons School graduates, men and women who have been trained to the highest standards and represent a tremendous vault of corporate knowledge. They are eager to provide the mission they trained for while escaping the grinding mundanity and incompetence of military leadership. Contract adversaries are here to stay and I believe they will be an excellent solution to the problems the modern military brings to readiness. A VFC-13 F-5N blast out of PDX., Tyler Rogoway/Author Speed And Angels I never took any moment of flying in the navy for granted. It always seemed like a spectacular playground filled with action and adrenaline. When I was in the reserves, I wanted to tell the real story of naval aviation. I decided a documentary would be the best way to make that happen. I convinced a good director friend of mine, Payton Wilson, to come to Fallon with me for a weekend with her camera. At first, she was reluctant, she was a female filmmaker from San Francisco, just about the opposite demographic that would be interested in making a film about Navy pilots. But once I got Peyton in the ready room and on the flight line, she began to come around. The energy of a squadron is infectious. The personalities and banter are unique. And the type of flying we do in the Navy is both visually beautiful and dramatic. Within a few weeks, we had made the fantastic sizzle reel called Last of the Dogfighters and I used that to both get permission from the Navy to produce the full-length documentary and raise the funds needed to pay for the film. We originally intended to make a film about the Saints and dogfighting, but once Peyton met the RAG students we were fighting, she fell in love with their stories. The RAG students were going through an intense year of change. Every day they faced a new and exciting challenge and an opportunity to fail. Every couple of weeks there was a new final exam they had to prepare for, and of course, the huge culminating obstacle of carrier qualifications made for fantastic, foreboding drama. Once Peyton convinced me that the Saints weren’t cool enough for our own full-length movie, we quickly settled on the two pilots we would follow for the course of the film, Jay and Meagan. They both had amazing backstories, incredible obstacles they were forced to overcome just to get to flight school. They are both compelling, charismatic personalities who light up the screen. And they both continued to give to their stories in ways we could not have anticipated before we began following them. They each had ridiculously dramatic events once they left the RAG that we discovered by accident. If it had been scripted, it would have defied credulity, but in real life, both stories were remarkable and showed just how amazing Jay and Meagan truly are. Easily the most difficult part of making Speed And Angels was the air-to-air filming. It literally took me years to finally get permission to fly F-5s and F-14s on dedicated filming sorties. The budget for the cameras, film crews, camera Learjet, and the bill from the government for the Tomcat and Tiger time was nearly half of the total budget of the film. But it’s a movie about beautiful jets so we did everything in our power to get beautiful footage. To tell the story of a dogfight is a difficult cinematic challenge. Actual aerial encounters take place at 20,000 feet, hundreds of knots, and after the planes merge, they can be a mile or two from each other as they claw through their high G turns to point back towards each other again. I had to choreograph a series on maneuvers and shots we could film and then cut together to give the viewer a sense they were in the cockpit, with their hands on the controls, pulling for a shot. We filmed from the air, from a specially modified Learjet, and from a mountain top in Fallon— Fairview Peak. We strapped small cameras throughout the cockpits of the fighters to give a number of vantage points, including on the helmets of some of the pilots as they were maneuvering or landing on the ship. The Speed And Angels crew next to an F-5 and F-14—both stars of the film—and the Wolfe Air Learjet camera-ship that captured the amazing aerial action sequences. , Courtesy of Paco All in all, it was an amazing experience. We set out intending to make a cool film about the Saints and dogfighting over a year and ended up making an amazing movie about two of the last F-14 students struggling against every obstacle imaginable to achieve their dreams and much more. ​ ​​​ Lions Of The Sky I was a fighter pilot for 20 years, but I’ve been a writer all my life. Writing novels has always been my dream, aside from flying fighters. I finally got the gumption to combine my two passions into a great story. On a macro scale, Lions Of The Sky is a fictionalized distillation of the crazy stories and characters I experienced over two decades in the Navy. Nearly every insane scene, both in the cockpits, in the ready rooms, and in the Officer’s Club, actually happened, with a little extra fiction dust thrown on top. That includes the dramatic, climactic final battle scene between the United States and China in the South China Sea. Not to give away too much, but in the mid-‘90s a U.S. Navy plane thought it was chasing a U.S. submarine for training. It turns out the sub was really Chinese and its captain thought he was being attacked. He radioed back to the homeland and a wave of Chinese fighters were launched. The carrier launched its own fighters to meet the challenge. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and the situation was quickly diffused. But in my book, things get a lot more interesting. Courtesy of Paco. More specifically, my novel is about a hard-boiled RAG instructor, Slammer Richardson, who became somewhat of a legend, but at the cost of losing his best friend. He is eager to get back to the action of the fleet because he can see that something big is brewing in the South China Sea. He’s got some misgivings about women in the cockpit so he does his best to avoid them, but the last class he’s assigned to mentor has not one, but two female students. Being aspiring fighter pilots, the women are bold and brash, and have no intention of fading into the background. The challenges of training in the F/A-18 force them to choose wildly different paths as they navigate the many hurdles and force Slammer to come to terms with thoughts he’d rather leave deeply buried. One of the aspects of flying in the Navy that always fascinated me was that once aircrew finish the RAG they are qualified to go to the fleet and possibly into combat, though they are far from proficient. It has happened many times and to Jay in Speed and Angels , in fact. During the course of the training in the story, there is a constant background drumbeat of aggressive action by China against their opponents to territorial claims in the South China Sea.  The tension rises steadily as the students face successive challenges. Ultimately, Slammer and a few of the students that survive the RAG are assigned to the carrier that is sent to face the Chinese. Far before the new fleet pilots are ready, they are thrown into a situation where the opponents are legitimate, the missiles are real and life and death decisions are made at the speed of sound. Much like Speed And Angels , I wanted Lions Of The Sky to be about the people behind the larger story. And also, like the film, as much as possible, I wanted the readers to feel like they were a part of the action, not just observers. Lions is a fantastic novel of action and peril, about the intense and real personal stories that underlay the wider fabric of geopolitical conflicts. ​ ​​​ It was the best of times, it was the worst of times… Easily the worst experience I ever had in a Navy jet was the day I crashed an F-5. It’s a long story, but the salient points are that I had blown tires on landing and skidded down the runway on nothing but the metal hubs. As I left the end of the runway, I shut down the engines just before the plane flipped over, shattering the canopy.  The plexiglass broke into razor-sharp shards and as the canopy rail bent back one of the shards pierced my neck like a dagger, just above the jugular.  If I had been going a knot or two faster when the plane flipped I would surely have bled to death. The second worst day I had in a Navy jet was my last flight. It was the culmination of over two decades of effort, sweat, dodging death, joy, and epic fun. But I had reached the end of my tenure and the next step for me in the military would have been a desk. I had spent a solid 20 years in the cockpit and I wasn’t ready to leave yet, but that wasn’t my decision. I felt like a perfectly healthy person who had to walk into the hospital to have his legs amputated. It didn’t make sense to me. But such is life. I had so many fantastic experiences in the Navy and in the cockpit. loved flying low-levels through the Cascade mountains during beautiful summer days, weaving back and forth with the other jet across valleys and darting through canyons, showing off to the people out boating or hiking. Bringing the Tomcat in for a 600-knot shit hot Break at the ship and nailing the landing was as intense as it gets. But if I was given the opportunity to go back and relive just one experience from my 20-year thrill show, I would have to drop back into December 1999. I was flying F-5s as a reservist, but I was also a junior airline pilot. I didn’t want to work over the Millennium New Year as I surely would. So, I got the squadron to cut me orders to fly with the reserves from December 15th of 1999, to January 7th of 2000. We didn’t have any ‘customers’ and there were few pilots in the squadron, so there were plenty of jets to play with. For three weeks, minus Christmas and the big New Year’s blowout in Tahoe, I flew three air combat sorties per day against the best dogfighters in the world. The weather was perfect, the gas was free, the jets were plentiful, and the dogfighting was the most intense and fun I ever experienced. If I make it to Heaven, that’s what every holiday season will be like.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 26, 2021",Confessions Of An A-6 Intruder Pilot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It may not be as well known as its maker’s point-nosed, swing-wing counterpart, the F-14 Tomcat , but Grumman’s A-6 Intruder was also a movie star and served as the backbone of the carrier air wing’s all weather, deep strike capability for decades. The all-business A-6 was capable of doling out a very heavy punch far from its home at sea and it was most at home down low, deep in the weeds, barrelling through enemy territory under the darkness of night. One A-6 pilot, Francesco “Paco” Chierici, flew the blunt-nosed attack jet during the twilight of its career and is about to share exactly what it is like to strap into the ‘flying drumstick’ and take it over hostile territory, down deep and dark ravines, and into the history books as it began to fade from the Navy’s inventory once and for all. Paco’s experiences at the controls of the Intruder are especially noteworthy as he would go on to fly higher-performance aircraft, transitioning into the F-14 and later becoming an aggressor pilot in the F-5 —areas we will discuss in part two of this series. So, suffice it to say, with thousands of hours in fast jets, Chierici has plenty to compare the A-6 to. Paco has thousands of hours in fast jets, with the A-6 being the first fleet aircraft he was assigned to fly. , Francesco “Paco” Chierici This tell-all feature also comes just as Paco released his first novel, Lions Of The Sky . If what you are about to read is any indication, his novel should be outstanding and we look forward to reviewing it soon. ​ ​​​ So, without further ado, let’s climb the intakes and step into the side-by-side cockpit of Grumman’s legendary deep strike phenom, and launch on alongside Paco on a ride to remember. So ugly you had to force yourself to be fiercely proud of it I’ll never forget the first time I walked up to an A-6. It was huge compared to the TA-4 Skyhawk jet trainer I had most recently flown. Nearly three times heavier. Two engines, versus one. Whereas the TA-4 was sleek and spindly on its tall landing gear, the Intruder was beefy and serious. The TA-4 looked nimble, the Tomcat was movie-pretty, the Intruder looked like what it was—a war club. The cockpit of the Intruder was radically different as well. The visibility over the big bulbous nose wasn’t as good as the Skyhawk, but the side glass went all the way down to my hip. It was insane, you could practically see underneath the plane without even rolling. USN The instrument panel was much more serious, as well. It was absolutely filled with screens and switches. It was clearly a huge step up from the trainers I’d spent the last few years mastering. Now it would be less about the flying and more about the mission. The biggest difference in the Intruder cockpit was the seat to my right, though. The Bombardier/Navigators (BNs) sat just below and aft of the pilot, but basically beside us. It was initially irritating to give up half of the cockpit, sacrificing visibility and primacy, to the BN, but I soon discovered that the camaraderie in that cockpit was unlike anything I would ever experience again. We would literally high-five after rolling off-target and spotting the bomb hit. It was awesome. The Intruder’s unique side-by-side seating layout, Bill Abbott/Wikicommons One of my favorite stupid-pilot tricks was asking the BN to check the right side just before coming into the overhead break. While he was looking out, I would disconnect his G-suit hose just before break-turning at 6.5Gs. I got Gradymon Hackwith to pass out a couple of times. He would punch me in the arm until I rolled into the groove and he was forced to let me fly the ball to landing. I would be laughing so hard there were tears. The exterior of the Intruder was dominated by its giant nose. The plane was quite obviously built around the enormous terrain-following radar. We also had an extremely prominent refueling probe permanently jutting out from where the radome met the lower part of the windscreen. The plane was kind of like a bulldog, so ugly you had to force yourself to be fiercely proud of it. USN A heavy hitter One of the great things about the Intruder was its punch. During its heyday, it was second only to the B-52 in payload. That was remarkable because she was only 54 feet long with a wingspan of 53 feet, as compared to the BUFF, which is 159 feet long and 185 feet wide. Also, she was launching off of a 1,100-foot carrier, whereas the BUFF rumbled down a two-mile runway before it was able to claw itself into the sky. Without any modifications, the A-6 could carry 28 MK-82 500-pound bombs. If the gear doors were removed, it was an even 30. That was 15,000 pounds of ordnance on a plane that only weighed 27,000 pounds empty. Fill her up with gas and we were launching off the deck in 300 feet, zero to 160 knots, at 60,000 pounds of gross weight. That was quite a ride. USN One of the advantages of having such an aerodynamically challenged airframe was that she didn’t handle much differently fully loaded than when she was clean. Alright, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but in all honesty, she was a dream to fly low, fast, and laden with weapons. The wing root, where the wing attached to the fuselage, was enormously thick. We could fly all day (and night) with a serious bomb load-out at low-level and pull five Gs or more. The Intruder was impervious. The addition of the FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) pod—which happened well before my time—enabled the A-6 to transition from a mere heavy-hitter to a precision striker. Whereas before there were two basic modes of delivery, the pilot doing a visual dive and the BN using the radar to drive the plane to a bomb release point, the FLIR introduced a level of precise aim-point fine-tuning that was completely unique at the time. In the target area, the BN would transition from the radar picture to the FLIR. Using the laser and the crosshairs in the FLIR picture he would fine tune the information the pilot used to arrive at the proper delivery point. Those capabilities enabled the Intruder to precisely deliver iron bombs and laser-guided bombs in almost any weather conditions and at night. A-6Es releasing thousands of pounds of Mk82 Snakeye bombs., USN A dark wizard by your side The Intruder was unlike any other plane I flew in that it was built with the other crew in mind—the BN. The A-6 was an all-weather, low-level, day/night, medium attack plane. Basically, a bad-ass bomber that could fly at treetop level through the enemy’s backyard and drop tons of ordnance. To accomplish that mission we had an amazing terrain following radar—again that big ugly thing on the nose. We also had a super-capable FLIR gimbaling pod under the chin. The FLIR pod didn’t add anything to the appearance, it looked like a wart on a witch’s chin, but it did add precision to the already impressive payload. The BN was responsible for using the radar to navigate through steep valleys and canyons using the raw returns. The pilot used computer-generated information on the screen in front of him to hand fly the plane along the general path the BN laid out. Once the target area was penetrated, the BN would activate the FLIR ball. He would ‘laze’ the target, both for accurate ranging regardless of what weapons were delivered, and as a target designator for laser-guided ordnance. He would also slew the crosshairs of the FLIR to sweeten up the final phase of targeting. The pilot would again follow the computer-generated guidance on our screens derived from all of the BNs efforts, flip the Master Arm on, and then pickle off the weapon. USN We would routinely do this at night, though the mountains, in the clouds and rain, and at 200 feet and 420 knots. There was zero automation, the pilot hand-flew the plane at all times. But to me, the craziest aspect was that the BNs stuck their heads in the boot covering the radar and FLIR screens through the whole mission. The boot was essentially a shroud with a padded hole where the BN would stick his face. It shielded the cockpit from the light of the radar so it wouldn’t blind the pilot during night flying. But when using it, the BN couldn’t see what was going on outside in the real world. So we would be flying through steep ravines at seven miles a minute at night as low as we dared, I would be glancing nervously at the granite cliff wall I could barely make out and the BN was stuck with his head down, arms spinning dials and switches like some dark wizard, immersed in his virtual world of radar returns and seemingly oblivious to the violent yanking and banking as we jinked through the low-level route. The flying became even more aggressive once we entered the target area and executed any number of dynamic weapons delivery pops, all while the BN kept his head glued in his boot. Craziness. Because of that dedication to the mission and the simple fact that the Intruder was designed to be optimized by the BN, the community was as flat as any I’ve ever seen. Meaning that there was almost no greater weight placed on whether someone was a pilot or a BN. This was definitely not true in the fighter communities, where pilots considered themselves far superior to anyone, whether they were in aviation or not. USN An accidental fighter pilot I was as close as you can be to an accidental fighter pilot. As a kid, I built plane models and hung them from the ceiling of my room in a huge Battle of Britain dogfight. But as I got older, I drifted away from the romance of aviation. I didn’t grow up around planes. No one I knew was a pilot. I wasn’t one of those kids who washed Pipers at the local airport for gas money. Fortunately, I needed money to pay for college and I joined the Navy ROTC. What began as a means to an end morphed into an opportunity of a lifetime. As a Midshipman, I was exposed to all of the communities that were available to me after graduation. After a couple of years, I was strongly inclined to pursue Naval Aviation and then something decisive happened the summer before Junior year. I got a back-seat ride in an F-14 with VF-51 and it was love at first flight. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else after I got a taste. I was obsessed. In the spring of our senior year, we received our community assignments. All the graduating ROTC and Naval Academy kids were ranked, then the slots were given out in order. It was, and is, extremely competitive to get aviation and I was beyond thrilled to receive my dream shot. Hundreds of SNAs—Student Naval Aviators—gathered in the Cradle of Naval Aviation—Pensacola, Florida—that summer and we churned our way through the sausage factory that was flight school. I made it through all the fail points: academics, physical training, and primary training in the T-34. After all that I was selected for jets. I went through intermediate training in the T-2 Buckeye, where I saw the carrier for the first time, and finally advanced flight training in the TA-4J Skyhawk. After carrier qualifying in the Skyhawk, I had finally completed the multi-year odyssey that began when I was first smitten. The winging ceremony was an emotional, momentary personal victory. I was finally a Naval Aviator sporting wings of gold. Little did I realize that the real work was about to begin. A young Paco standing in front of his mount. , Francesco Chierici The night is dark and full of terrors The A-6 was super honest to land. It had a great combination of wing sweep, responsive engines, and drag which allowed for quick and fine corrections while flying the meatball. Near the completion of training, we would carrier qualify, day and night. It was a big deal, our final exam. In the Intruder community, we would go to the boat for the first time with a fellow student, a BN that was our classmate. I was lucky enough to go with my good friend Gradymon. It was an intense experience for both of us, but especially for Grady since he had never seen an aircraft carrier from the air. The first time the BNs ever got to land on a ship was with a fellow knucklehead student (who routinely disconnected his G-suit hose at inappropriate times) piloting him. Those guys were either crazy or brave as shit. USN The day landings were awesome and similar to the landings I had done in the T-2 and TA-4, but the night landings were going to be a completely new ballgame for me. It was going to be a huge comfort to have Grady by my side. Unfortunately, we didn’t make it up that night. We spent the evening on the USS Ranger , having dinner and waiting for our turn to climb into a jet. The plan was for us to hot-switch into a plane that our classmates were currently flying. After their last night landing, they would be chained to the deck. With the engines still running, we would switch crews one at a time until Grady and I were safely strapped into the still running jet. Then we’d get fueled up and taxi to the catapult to take our turn at six night traps. We tracked our jet as she went around the pattern, successfully landing five times. After she took off for the last time, we made our way up to flight deck control to await the last landing and the hot-switch. There were multiple TVs and a window facing the landing area. I’ll never forget watching my jet on the TV as she was about to land. I leaned over to tighten my chest strap and she hit the deck and caught a wire. As I stood up, I could see her through the window. One moment she was decelerating with both engines howling at full power, just as normal. The next, the pilot and BN ejected, the jet angled out of the landing area toward a row of parked F/A-18s, slammed into them, then flipped into the water. One of the F/A-18s snapped out of her chains and flipped into the water as well. Another was impacted so hard it also snapped its chains and spun 180 degrees, managing to barely stay on the deck. I stood there in Flight Deck Control with my hands still on my straps, my jaw hanging open. The Intruder I was supposed to climb into and fly my very first night carrier landings had just broken its tailhook, smashed into three Hornets, and flipped into the sea. Welcome to naval aviation! USN At home in the weeds In the Intruder, flying nap-of-the-earth was our bread and butter. We did it during the day, free and loose, darting down the tiniest riverbeds and through the slightest cracks we could find. During the night and in bad weather, we also flew low and fast, but in a much more prescribed manner. The low levels we flew were delineated in a huge manual, which contained the lat/long fixes defining the routes themselves. For the most part, the routes were ten miles wide, five miles to each side of the center-line running from fix to fix. A ten-mile corridor actually gives a pilot a tremendous amount of leeway to find the most tactically relevant course through the terrain, as well as the most fun. So, even the same route was not always the same. Night low levels were a different beast. To become night proficient, a pilot and BN crew would have to complete three steps within a week. First, they would have to fly a route in the dome simulator. Then they would fly the same route during the day, and finally at night. This gave the crew two opportunities for the BN to familiarize himself with the radar picture before flying the actual route in darkness. Once you were night low-level qualified, you could then fly any route, day or night. A-6 Intruder rocketing through a very deep canyon as seen from the BN’s position., Unknown Nuclear chariot One of the missions the A-6 was initially designed for was nuclear delivery of the B61 tactical nuclear bomb , affectionately known as the ‘dial-a-yield.’ There was literally a rotating switch inside a panel where the ordnancemen could select from .3 to 340 kilotons for when the bomb detonated. It was an incredible amount of power in a weapon that measured only twelve feet by one-foot and weighed just 700 pounds. By comparison, ‘Little Boy’ which was dropped on Hiroshima, weighed almost 10,000 pounds and had a defined yield of 15 kilotons. It was chilling to imagine that something so diabolically versatile and powerful could be carried on a small jet and weigh less than an AGM-88 Hight-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM). The main method of delivering the B61 was through a specific maneuver selectable in the computer, the LABS-IP, which stood for Low Altitude Bombing System – Initial Point. To practice this delivery, we would ingress to the target at low-level, usually at 480 knots, and once reaching the target area, we would accelerate to 540 knots. B61 and its components. , DOE At a certain distance from the target, which the BN was constantly fine-tuning through the radar and FLIR, the computer would command the pilot to pitch up. We would get guidance on our primary instrument commanding us into a 4G pull and we had to correct the horizontal flight path as well. Despite the Gs, we had to be as smooth as possible because at some point during the pull, 50-75 degrees nose high, the computer would release the weapon into a massive loft.  The pilot would then keep his pull through a Half Cuban Eight , ending the maneuver heading in the direction they came from, at 200 feet, pedaling as fast as they could go. The bomb would be lofted as high as six miles into the sky, and depending on the programming for the specific target, a parachute would open allowing the B61 to float toward earth, thus giving the delivery aircraft valuable time to race away before detonation. The procedures called for each crew to close one eye at the time of detonation, in case the flash caused blindness. We used to joke that the pilots would close both eyes and the BNs would keep theirs open, since their jobs were done. It was a heartless crowd. I came into the fleet just after Gulf War I, in the summer of 1991. The Cold War was done, and we had just shed the onerous nuke delivery mission. I was one of the first pilots in my squadron not to have to go through the two-month drudgery of getting my ‘Nuke Cert.’ The Navy was out of the tactical nuclear bomb delivery business by the early 1990s. , FAS.ORG Joining the fleet I joined VA-155 the day they triumphantly flew in from their Gulf War cruise. The Silver Foxes were heroic in the conflict. They flew the first-night sorties into Bagdad at low-level, attacking vital military targets as surface-to-air missiles flew in all directions overhead. Throughout the forty-day air campaign, they were instrumental in completely demolishing Saddam’s military. Tragically, they lost one plane in combat in the waters just off Kuwait. After combat ended, they partied their way home through various exotic ports of call, drunk from all their death-defying exploits. I remember swelling with pride as I stood in my khaki uniform on the flight line and watched them fly in. The next six months, on the other hand, sucked as bad as any in my Navy career. VA-145 A-6E on the ramp in 1992. , USN I was the first new pilot the Foxes had gotten in over a year. They were all heroes and I was just the FNG (F’n New Guy). It was almost impossible to penetrate the camaraderie they had naturally forged. It took a few of the older guys rotating out and an additional influx of new guys, including a bunch of my classmates, for us to finally feel like we belonged. The Foxes ended up being an amazing experience for me, filled with incredible adventures and great people. The work-ups for our first cruise were instrumental in building the new collection of Foxes into a cohesive squadron. The experienced aviators trained the new guys well and we quickly bonded into an effective unit. It was during this early stage of my fleet career that I first experienced the shattering pain of loss. Air Wing Two lost a Tomcat during a night mission while we were all at NAS Fallon. And much closer to home, my good friend Grady and his pilot Dewey, fellow Silver Foxes, perished in a low-level training accident. Of the twenty-plus friends I lost during my career, Grady’s was one of the most difficult to endure. We had come up through the RAG together as fast friends. I had flown with Grady more than any other single BN in my brief career. We rejoiced when we were both assigned to VA-155 and looked forward to three more years of fun and flying. The sudden shock of his death shook me to my core, damaging my confidence for months. USN Intruder’s place in the Air Wing When I cruised on the Ranger, we were the last of the all-Grumman Air Wings [read all about this unique arrangement in this past post of ours ]. There were a number of other NSFW and non-PC terms that were used to reference the absence of the new kid on the block, the F/A-18 Hornet. Air Wing Two was composed primarily of two squadrons of Tomcats and two of Intruders. My first squadron assignment was with VA-155, the Silver Foxes. Our sister squadron was VA-145, the Swordsmen. Air Wing Two on the Ranger was basically the last of the old-school air wings. The division of labor was absolutely clear, if you needed the skies swept of enemy jets, the Tomcats took to the air. If you needed bridges demolished, buildings leveled, hardened bunkers penetrated, ground-armor destroyed, troops-in-the-open decimated, or SAM sites taken out, then the Intruder was on the job. Though in the competition between Top Gun and Flight of the Intruder movies, the f^@%!*g Tomcats clearly won the battle. But the long list of accomplishments achieved by the Intruders in Air Wing Two during the first Gulf War clearly overshadowed their more glamorous Grumman brethren. Ranger with its Grumman Air Wing. , USN All that gas Most of my career was spent operating in the Persian Gulf where we had ample Air Force tanker support, but I flew a handful of tanker hops where we would strap four 2,000-pound drop-tanks and a centerline mounted D-704 refueling-pod, which aside from containing the retracting hose and basket, held another 2,000-pounds of gas. The most fun tanker hops were the daytime yo-yo missions where you would launch before the fighters and strikers, meet them a couple hundred miles from the carrier along their strike route, give them almost all of your gas (18,000-20,000 pounds of give!) and then race back to the carrier for a solo shit-hot break. The most rewarding tanker hops were when you were assigned as a recovery tanker for the last event of the night. Your job was to orbit overhead and be prepared to offer emergency gas to the planes that were coming down to land in the event they boltered (missed all the wires) or were waved off. During Blue-Water ops, when we operated beyond the range of possibility to divert to a land-based runway, it was particularly challenging and a massive responsibility. Carrier-based jets are fuel-critical from the moment we start our engines. When we fly far enough out to sea where calling ‘uncle’ and landing on a runway isn’t possible, every ounce of gas becomes precious. An A-6E Intruder about to tank from a KA-6D Intruder. The KA-6Ds were uniquely configured with an internal hose and drogue system and were notoriously hard worn with extreme limits on their flight envelope due to being passed around from deployment to deployment. By the time Paco was flying Intruders, the A-6E carrying a refueling pod was the common ‘buddy tanker’ setup., USN Once the night missions are complete and it’s time to land, the jets have enough gas for maybe two attempts to catch a wire. Throw in some weather, a pitching deck, a dark night and the knowledge that you either are landing safely on the ship, or ejecting into the frigid ocean, a pilot can get so tense that they practically suck the seat cushion up their butt. Read all about how to land a jet on a carrier at night in this previous feature of ours . Everyone I know has had a ‘night-in-the-barrel,’ a night where they had difficulty beyond normal catching a wire. And after every miss, the tension became more intense. You knew that five-thousand people were watching your every failed attempt, including your peers, your CO, the Skipper of the ship, and most likely the Strike-Group Admiral. As the recovery tanker you were the last line of hope for a strung-out pilot who had already failed to land a few times. His, or her, nerves were surely shattered and confidence was in their boots. On the last pass before the troubled plane would need to refuel, the recovery tanker would drop down to shadow, or ‘hawk,’ the jet. USN You would have to maneuver yourself to time it perfectly so that if the jet failed to land once again you would be just in front of them at 2,000 feet. Then that shaky, panicky pilot could spot you immediately as they cleaned up and climbed to your altitude right behind you. Then they would have to perform an activity just slightly less challenging than landing on a carrier at night, they would have to plug their refueling probe into a basket dangling into the slipstream fifty feet behind the tanker at night, maybe in bad weather, at 2,000 feet. Or, they were going swimming. And the reward for a successful plug and refuel was another look at the boat. Yay. I know a guy who had to go around so many times he plugged the hawking tanker three times.  After he finally landed, he was so wrung out he had to be helped from the cockpit. And after all the drama was complete for the night, the recovery tanker had to come in and land. And there was no one hawking you with extra gas if you couldn’t make it aboard. I didn’t love flying tanker missions and thankfully I didn’t have to fly many, but the yo-yo, and especially the recovery tanker missions were always gratifying. USN Ranger into the storm By the time our workups were complete and we headed out on my first deployment I felt very comfortable in the Intruder and in the squadron. There was an undeniable thrill about leaving on my first deployment. It felt very grown-up, even though I was barely twenty-five. I was a junior officer, though we had had enough new guys where I wasn’t an FNG anymore. I had been in the squadron for over a year and become a Landing Signals Officer (LSO) as well, which was a fantastic position of responsibility and a job I thoroughly enjoyed. After multiple detachments to Fallon and working from the Ranger I also felt extremely comfortable as a member of the Air Wing. Many of my friends from flight school ended up in the same Air Wing, scattered throughout the Tomcat, Intruder, Prowler, and Hawkeye squadrons. It was one of the closest Air Wings I was a part of, with great friendships and camaraderie across all the squadrons. We pulled into Yokosuka, Japan. I climbed Mt. Fuji after a big night at the O-Club, which ended up being more of a challenge than it should have. Many of us spent five days partying in Tokyo, which was amazing. The ship left Japan for Busan, Korea, spending a few days at sea so the pilots could all fly at night. Ranger pulling into Yokuska in 1992 with Paco and VA-155 onboard. , USN At sea, each pilot is required to get a minimum of one night trap aboard the ship every seven days. One of the lesser-known pains of leaving port after four to five days of hard-charging was climbing into the cockpit for a night ‘re-qual’ all exhausted and hung over. It was in Busan, on our second day of a planned four-day visit, where the cruise ratcheted up in intensity. The entire Strike Group was emergency recalled to their ships. We were pulling out immediately. Saddam had repeatedly violated the terms of the 1991 Cease Fire agreement. The powers that be demanded a US carrier on scene in the Persian Gulf to keep the dictator in check. The Ranger and her Strike Group sped away from the Korean Peninsula with great urgency. It seemed there was action to be had again. USN Leadership was so intent to have a carrier presence as soon as possible that Ranger was sent directly through a Category 4 typhoon while en route. All of the other ships in the Strike Group were sent far south in the Indian Ocean to skirt around the massive storm, delaying them by many days. The Ranger rocked like a cork for three straight days. All non-essential activities were suspended, inside and out. The galleys closed and the only food available was sandwiches and cereal. The ship was rolling so steeply that when you walked along the passageways it felt as if you were walking on the walls at times. We stuck our flight boots under the edges of our mattresses so we wouldn’t roll out of the bunk beds. I’ll never forget watching the TV footage of the flight deck. During the peak of the storm, the Ranger , an 80,000-ton displacement, 1,000-foot, Forrestal class supercarrier with 70 aircraft on board, was hitting the waves so steeply that we were taking green water over the bow. Not sea spray, not splashes. The bow of the huge ship, with an entire Air Wing worth of airplanes exposed and chained to the deck, was digging into the oncoming waves so deeply that it was briefly submerged. USN Needless to say, after we came out the other side, the planes were a mess. Our incredible maintainers had a week to perform a miracle. They essentially had to rebuild a third of the planes that had been bathed in corrosive salt water. It was one of the most incredible feats of dedication I witnessed in my career. Those guys worked around the clock untill they dropped so that when we arrived in the Gulf we would have up jets to cross the beach with. The transit from Korea to the Gulf was an amazing feat in itself. The Ranger steamed over 7,000 NM in under two weeks. A trip that would normally have taken three weeks, plus a port call in Singapore, to accomplish. Sound asleep over Iraq I’ll never forget the excitement that was building those last few days before we relieved the Independence on-station in the Persian Gulf. The other new guys and I were certain we were going to leap right into combat missions. My new BN, Pauly B, and I were tasked with planning the first mission in country. This was a huge honor and responsibility—or so I thought. Ranger relieving Independence on station in Persian Gulf in 1992. , USN Pauly and I stayed up for two days straight planning a 25-plane mission that involved three KC-135 Air Force tankers and two laps around Southern Iraq. I was so spooled up I couldn’t sleep the night before. Pauly and I briefed a packed ready room full of aircrew from the entire Wing. We were putting Saddam on notice, the Ranger and Air Wing Two were on station and we were ready to play. The brief ended in the early afternoon and Pauly and I grabbed a quick dinner. We dressed and launched as the sun hung low on the horizon. I was fielding massive waves of excitement and trepidation as we flew toward the tanker rendezvous on the Saudi/Iraqi border. Not only was I leading my first mission in-country, but I had never before tanked off the feared KC-135, known as the ‘Iron Maiden.’ It certainly didn’t help my nerves that night was falling rapidly. If I failed to tank, I would have to return to Ranger in shame. If I damaged the basket by being ham-handed, the entire evolution could be scrapped. An A-6E approaches a KC-135E equipped with the dreaded Iron Maiden. The basket, which is attached to the KC-135’s boom via an adapter, is made of metal instead of the softer materials found on other hose and drogue systems. This makes it far less forgiving and it can even wheel around in turbulence and smash into the aircraft causing damage. Hence its other nickname—The Wrecking Ball., USN Fortunately, I was able to fight my way through the ordeal and get my gas. Once the whole package had tanked, Pauly conducted the roll call and we were off, heading into Iraq for our first lap. I’ve had never seen anything as black as western Iraq. There wasn’t a light on the ground for a thousand miles. It was a moonless night and the stars were the brightest I had ever seen, but they provided no illumination of the earth below. I felt as if we were flying into a black hole. The Intruder had a basic autopilot, just heading and altitude, and I engaged it once we were on the correct heading. After two sleepless nights and the excitement of the mission and stress of meeting the Iron Maiden under such intense circumstances, I was absolutely drained. My eyes blinked longer and longer until I actually fell asleep in a combat-loaded A-6E Intruder flying through hostile territory while leading a strike package. Not one of my prouder moments. But as it turned out, Pauly B was dead asleep right next to me, too. USN I still get shivers thinking about how long we would have flown on that heading. How far we would have gone. We were pointed directly at Syria, which surely would not have appreciated a U.S. Navy strike package coming close to its border. Ultimately, we were saved by chance, though it nearly gave me a heart attack. While I was sleeping on a hard ejection seat in a cramped cockpit as deeply as I’ve ever slept in my life, our ALR-67 radar warning receiver (RWR) began a high warble. We had been locked up by a radar. I woke with my heart in my mouth disengaged the autopilot and jinked hard. I looked down at the ALR-67 screen to determine the direction of the radar and saw that we had been locked up by one of the F-14s in our group. The RIO came up on the secure radio and quickly apologized. It was one of their new guys screwing around with his radar. He hadn’t meant to lock us up. Pauly and I looked at each other, realizing we had both been asleep and that we had just dodged a virtual bullet. We were wide awake, but it only lasted fifteen minutes before exhaustion set in again. We worked really hard telling dirty jokes and stories for the next four hours till the terror of the night trap was enough to bring us fully awake again. The remainder of our four months in the gulf was a series of similar patrol missions punctuated by port calls in Dubai. Though I never saw any action in Iraq, I did achieve a measure of detente with the KC-135’s Iron Maiden. She never bit off my probe or shattered my canopy, I never ripped off her basket. How to kill MiGs in an Intruder At its prime, which unfortunately coincided with its retirement from service, the Intruder could carry just about every piece of air-to-mud ordnance in the US inventory. And, the AIM-9 Sidewinder. Being a frustrated fighter pilot, I devised a game plan for how I would get the first Intruder air-to-air kill should any Iraqi MiG-29 be so foolish as to come at us. If we were flying a counter-radar mission our standard loadout was an AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) missile and an AIM-9 Sidewinder. Silver Foxes’ sister squadron, the Swordsman, seen carrying an AIM-9 Sidewinder during a mission over the Persian Gulf in 1992. , USN My plan of record was to go nose-to-nose with the Fulcrum, wait till he got to three miles on our nose then shoot the HARM in his direction. The big missile with a huge smoke trail would spook the Iraqi fighter into break turning just in front of me. When he was close enough, I would fire the Sidewinder for the victory. In the folly of youth, I thought this was an excellent plan and no so secretly hoped an unwitting MiG-29 would come poking around. Thankfully it never became an issue. Though I still like to think it might have worked. The glory! Intruding into Somalia As we were nearing the end of our time in the Gulf, another global hot-spot flared up and Ranger was, once again, tasked with being on-station. In early December of 1992, the feeble government of Somalia completely collapsed and the warlords were battling each other for primacy. The thugs were stealing farmers’ crops immediately after harvest and the country was on the verge of massive starvation. The United Nations was sending in relief but the warlords were stealing those supplies, as well. The Ranger and Air Wing Two skipped our last port call in Dubai and made for the coast off Mogadishu at high speed. It was exciting to plan for a new mission in a new country. We were initially tasked with providing high cover and close-air-support for the U.N. personnel. The threat to us was minimal, ground fire from technicals—civilian pickup trucks modified with heavy guns. There was also a slim possibility of shoulder-launched SAMs, though none had been reported in the area. For the most part, we expected to operate with impunity, so long as we stayed above the range of the heavy guns. USS Ranger taking part in Operation Restore Hope in 1992. , USN The Commander of the Air Wing set the floor at 5,000 feet for normal operations and as low as we wanted for special circumstances. Those included low, fast fly-bys called ‘shows of force’ designed to strike fear into the hearts of bad actors on the ground below. We would come in at 50 feet and 500 knots, sneaking in from behind their position. It was a hugely effective and non-lethal tactic. We were briefed that the biggest threat to our health was the diseases on the ground in the event we ejected. Since the Somalia visit was unplanned, none of us had received the proper inoculations. I’ll never forget our flight doc briefing the ready room about two additions to our flight gear. Two pre-filled syringes loaded with a cocktail of who-knows-what designed to keep us reasonably safe should our boots actually hit Somali soil. If we punched out, the moment we landed we were supposed to yank out the syringes, pop the tops and inject ourselves straight through our G-suits into the meat of our thighs. What a trip. By this time, the various squadron crews in the Wing had become very close. The E-2 Hawkeye guys were not allowed to cross feet-dry. One day, while we were telling them about the incredible views we were enjoying as we flew, they told us they couldn’t see us on their radars after we were a certain distance inland. Naturally, we devised a code word so we could break the 5,000-foot deck and fly low, where the Intruder was meant to be. Read all about the E-2 Hawkeye’s work near Somalia and so much more in this past feature of ours Whenever we flew with all junior officer crews, we would skim over the Somali heartland marveling at the change in topography. We saw giraffes and camels and strange chimney-like structures that, after some time, we determined were actually massive anthills. It was depressing to see fertile farm fields filled with water and crops, but devoid of farmers. They were starving because the warlords stole their harvest, not a lack of production. My most enduring memory from the three weeks over Somalia was flying high cover for the amphibious landing. My BN and I began orbiting at 0400 in the pitch-black directly over the landing spot on the beach, loaded with laser-guided bombs. The BN scanned the shoreline with his FLIR, ensuring there was no opposition while dozens of landing craft came ashore disgorging trucks, APCs, and Marines. VA-155’s sister squadron seen flying over Somalia during the Ranger’s mission there in 1992., USN Over the course of a couple of hours watch the empty beach fill with troops and machinery in an orderly manner and organize into a massive formation. As the sun peeked over the horizon, the headlights came on and the mechanized columns snaked away, dispersing in various directions into the countryside. It was an impressive and slightly emotional display. A few days later, the Ranger and her Strike Group were released from Operation Restore Hope and we proceeded to Perth, Australia for our first port call in over six weeks. Six quick interesting thoughts on flying Intruders 1)  The Intruder was super fun to fly low and fast. It was like a Cadillac, smooth, powerful, and stable, with great visibility. 2)  There were a number of landmarks along low-level routes that were traditional check-in-the box items. For instance, a derelict red pickup truck rusting away high in the Cascade Mountains in Washington. My personal favorite was checking the price of unleaded gas on a station marquee just before Winnemucca, Nevada when flying to Fallon. 3)  We had the Pickle Barrel bombing patch. To earn it the pilot had to literally drop a Mk-76 ‘Blue Death’ practice bomb into a barrel on the Boardman, Oregon target range on his first visual delivery of the month. Only one chance every month. Took me forever to get that damn patch. USN 4)  We had a not-so-stealthy manner of doing awesome fly-bys of the Officer’s Club, which was on the beach at NAS Whidbey Island. Coming back to base you could request an “Intruder Attack.” If the pattern was clear, it was generally approved. Ostensibly, we were conducting a practice bombing run on the valuable assets of the base. In reality, it was a license to do a 200 foot, 420-knot run right over all your buddies heads at the club. Everyone would come out to watch. It was truly awesome. 5)  Even though we had spin/departure procedures in the event of out-of-control flight, in reality, all the pilot had to do was release any pressure on the stick and rudders. The giant nose was an Earth-seeking magnet. Eventually, you ended up pointed at the dirt and the plane was flying again. 6)  When we flew through clouds and rain at night, as we often did in the Pacific Northwest, we would frequently get arcing blue static electricity across the windscreen called Saint Elmo’s Fire. What was unique to the Intruder was that the refueling probe sticking up prominently between the windscreen panels would also be affected, developing a bizarre cone of blue static electricity pointed aft. Retiring the Intruder to conquer the Cat Shortly after returning from the ’92-’93 cruise, VA-155 was decommissioned. It had been planned for a long time so it was no surprise, but it still stung. Most of the junior officers were dispersed into other fleet squadrons. I was lucky, I got to go to our sister squadron in Air Wing Two, VA-145 The Swordsmen. I showed up for work in April of ’93 only to discover that the Swordsmen had just been put on the chopping block, as well. VA-145 was to be decommissioned five months later, at the end of September. The nice thing was that they were a good squadron whom we were familiar with and we all flew our butts off in those few months together. The challenge was that now there would be another thirty pilots on the streets looking for a home. I had not-so-secretly always wanted to fly the Tomcat since my backseat ride as a Midshipman. I spent many weeks putting together a bulletproof transition package to submit to the board, which was ultimately approved. I left for the east coast RAG (Replacement Air Group training squadron) in September of ’93 as excited for a move as I had ever been. USN Going through a RAG the second time was almost stress-free, even though I was completing the full, new-guy syllabus. The basic systems were almost identical—thank you Grumman Iron Works—so the academic portion was fairly rote. But quite obviously, despite sharing a huge amount of DNA, the Tomcat was a significantly different beast than the Intruder. And I was absolutely thrilled to the core! The power differential even in just the F-14A-model with the TF-30 engines was so insanely superior I didn’t stop smiling for three months. The B-model with the F110 engines was just ludicrous . During my B-model demo hop I was flying in the Whiskey areas, about a hundred miles east over the ocean. The RIO (Radar Intercept Officer) had me go down to 200 feet, accelerate to 450 knots, then pull 4 Gs till I was straight up as I plugged in full afterburner. The plane had no tanks nor rails—slick as a newborn—and she leaped into the sky like a Saturn-5 rocket. Maybe 30 seconds later I was rolling over to level at 50,000 feet while still doing 250 knots. USN The air-to-air mission was also completely new to me. But I found it intuitive and creative in a manner that felt very natural. I loved working with the RIO to solve the angles for the long-range intercepts and missile employment and I had waited my whole life to dogfight in the visual arena. If I had been half as skilled at dogfighting as I was enthusiastic, I would have been pretty good. All in all, I enjoyed the three-year head start in flying fleet jets over my classmates immensely, but all of that came to a screaming halt when it came time to bring the beast aboard the ship, especially at night. I already had a couple hundred fleet traps in the Intruder and I was an experienced LSO. The ship didn’t intimidate me, in fact I had been the Top Nugget – the best new guy – on my first cruise. But landing the Tomcat was a completely different, and quite humbling, affair. Where the Intruder was instantly responsive to power, angle of attack (AOA), and glide slope corrections, the Tomcat was anything but. The TF-30 engines had a nasty lag, which made power corrections a combination of guesswork and experience. The wings stuck out to 20 degrees in the landing configuration, which was much more than the Intruder. Combined with a massive, flat fuselage designed in itself to provide significant lift, the airframe had a tendency to float and decelerate when power was removed. USN Lastly, the Tomcat had a massive hook-to-eye distance meaning that as the pilot sat far head, at the very tip of the jet, maneuvering to keep his eyeballs on the glide-slope, sixty-three feet behind him was a hook which hung about fifteen feet below. With even the slightest movement of the nose, the hook could move many feet at the end of that moment-arm causing the pilot to either catch a 1-wire or completely miss all the wires even if he could still see the meatball in the center. In short, the F-14 was a huge challenge to land aboard the ship, much less to do it actually well consistently. Bombcat’s brain trust A few of my former Intruder peers and I were drafted into VF-213, the Blacklions, after the Tomcat RAG to help them spool up their air-to-ground program . As much as I’d always wanted to be a ‘fighter-guy’ flying nothing but BFM and air-to-air sorties at supersonic speeds, it was my experience in air-to-ground that brought me to the ‘World Famous Blacklions.’ VF-213 was in the process of integrating the LANTIRN targeting pod with the Tomcat and eager to get smart on air-to-mud tactics. The LANTIRN was a massively capable FLIR pod that was easily mounted on a shoulder station. It proved to be an immensely capable pairing between off-the-shelf technology and a legacy air-superiority fighter that extended the F-14’s service life for another fifteen years. With the LANTIRN pod the F-14 became the most capable platform in the Navy to deliver LGBs, far exceeding the F/A-18C’s targeting capabilities, speed, loiter time, and range. Also, the Tomcat looked a billion times more badass. USN Having a thorough background in delivering ground ordnance and weaponeering certainly made for an easy integration into the fighter Ready Room. We former A-6 folks were welcomed and tasked with sharing best practices with the rest of the squadron. But I thirsted for BFM missions more than anything. Anytime I could get in the air for some high-aspect air combat maneuvering, I was happy. So, I made sure to include an off-target aerial engagement scenario at the end of the bombing hops whenever I could get away with it. The age of the Intruder had come and gone The newest jets I ever flew in the Navy were Intruders in VA-155. We began receiving newly winged SWIP (System Weapon Improvement Program) jets as soon as I checked in on board. Many had come right out of the factory, then diverted into the program to upgrade them with new wings and digital integration. I flew jets that had barely ten hours on them, with none of the paint worn off and all of the labels for the buttons and switches still visible. Yet even with the upgrade in capabilities, the Intruder was not survivable in the modern battlespace. With the advent of the newest Russian SAM systems, the sanctuary of low-flight was removed. The Intruder could carry a massive bomb load, but modern warfare demanded precision over quantity. Anyone could carry LGBs at that point and the introduction of GPS-aided JDAM made delivering ordnance precisely in any weather almost as simple as entering GPS coordinates. The mission the Intruder had been designed for and had excelled at, all weather, day/night, low-level delivery of tons of ordnance, had disappeared. USN Editor’s note: In part two of our series, which will be posted soon, we will talk what it was like transitioning from moving mud to dogfighting, going on cruise with the F-14 compared to the A-6, losing comrades, becoming an aggressor, making an incredible documentary, and writing a novel based loosely on a lifetime of adventures in the air, as well as so much more.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 16, 2021",New Destroyer Task Force Established To Hunt Russian Submarines In The Atlantic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has established a dedicated anti-submarine task group of Arleigh Burke -class destroyers that will be on call to conduct operations in the North Atlantic Ocean on short notice. The establishment of this force follows years of Navy and other U.S. military officials sounding the alarm about the potential threats posed by Russian submarines off the East Coast of the United States. The Russian Navy’s continued acquisition of more modern and increasingly quiet nuclear-powered submarines, especially examples of the Yasen and Yasen-M class guided-missile submarines that American officials have said are “ on par with ours ,” has been of particular concern. This new anti-submarine force, officially named Task Group Greyhound , quietly reached initial operational capability on Sept. 1, 2021, but the Navy only recently highlighted its creation . Greyhound is set to be a rotational force with four Arleigh Burkes assigned to it at all times. US Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers., USN Greyhound’s job is to “provide the fleet with predictable, continuously ready and fully certified warships,” Navy Rear Admiral Brendan McLane, head of Naval Surface Force Atlantic, said during a ceremony aboard the Arleigh Burke- class destroyer Thomas Hudner (DDG-116) in Mayport, Florida, on Monday. “The ships will be ready to accomplish the full range of missions — including tracking Russian undersea activity in the Atlantic and maritime homeland defense for our nation.” The task group’s name appears to be, at least in part, a reference to the 2020 movie of the same name , starring Tom Hanks, which was based on the C.S. Forester novel The Good Shepherd . The book, and its film adaption, center on the exploits of a U.S. Navy destroyer escorting merchant ships across the Atlantic during World War II in the face of Nazi submarines. Certain types of destroyers at that time were referred to as greyhounds . Those convoy escort operations were part of a larger Allied naval campaign that became known as the Battle of the Atlantic, or sometimes the Second Battle of the Atlantic to acknowledge similar operations during World War I. Soviet and Western naval activity in this ocean during the Cold War has been referred to on occasion as the Third Battle of the Atlantic. U.S. military officials have more recently dubbed the latest increase in Russian naval activity in this region, and Western responses to it, as the Fourth Battle of the Atlantic . At present, the Thomas Hudner and USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) , the latter of which only returned to the United States earlier this year after years of being forward-deployed in Spain, are the only ships assigned to Greyhound. The USS The Sullivans (DDG-68), which is presently part of the multinational carrier strike group centered on the U.K. Royal Navy’s HMS Queen Elizabeth, is set to join the unit when it returns home in January. Later next year, the USS Cole (DDG-67) and Gravely (DDG-107) will arrive at the task group, while Donald Cook will leave to begin a planned maintenance period, at which point the force will have the expected four destroyers. “The idea is we put in the ships that already have deployments under their belt and are most ready and most experienced,” Rear Admiral McLane told reporters during a call afterward, according to USNI News . The hope is that the rotational task group will also help streamline the scheduling of training opportunities, including larger exercises involving other assets besides Arleigh Burkes . Anti-submarine warfare, in general, is a complex mission set, as you can read more about in this past War Zone feature . “We can align everybody up to take advantage of whatever training opportunities may exist, as well as tactical development exercises like in the past Black Widow, and then training opportunities like submarine command course operations,” Rear Admiral Brian Davies, the commander of Submarine Group 2 and the deputy commander of U.S. 2nd Fleet, also told reporters. “We can align those assets to go after these training environments that may exist.” The Navy reactivated 2nd Fleet in 2018 specifically in response to concerns about increased Russian naval activity, particularly submarine operations, in the North Atlantic. Exercise Black Widow, which Davies mentioned here, is a relatively new annual submarine and anti-submarine warfare drill in the Atlantic, the first iteration of which was conducted in 2020 . The second one just wrapped up in August . Various Navy ships and submarines, as well as aircraft, such as P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and MH-60R Seahawk helicopters , have taken part in these exercises, which have also seen the service’s new submarine aggressor squadron, or AGGRON, help provide realistic subsurface opponents.

An unidentified Arleigh Burke- class destroyer seen through one of the periscopes on the Los Angeles- class attack submarine USS San Juan (SSN-751) during the first Black Widow exercise in 2020., USN Of course, Greyhound isn’t just about training. The Navy clearly expects the task group to help the service respond faster and more effectively to potential submarine threats, especially to the U.S. homeland. “The strategic threat to the homeland has entered a new era and our key competitors have deployed and continue to advance a range of capabilities to hold the homeland at risk,” Rear Admiral McLane had said at the ceremony earlier this week. “So instead of having to go out and find an asset to go and hunt, say, a high-end Russian submarine, we have these assets pre-assigned and they’re able to practice in this team-to-teams approach that we like to talk about when it comes to the arc of undersea warfare.” As already noted, all of this is well in line with a steady stream of public statements from the U.S. military about the potential threats that increasingly advanced Russian submarines present to American interests in the Atlantic and the immediate security of the country. “Within a five-year period, they’ll have eight to nine of those submarines, which will be a persistent proximate threat off of our East and West Coasts that we haven’t had ever in the past,” U.S. Air Force General Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said at a Congressional hearing earlier this year. VanHerck was speaking specifically about Russia’s nuclear-powered Yasen- class guided-missile submarines, and the new subclass of Yasen-M s, which reportedly have a number of improved features. He said that these boats, which you read more about here , are “on par with ours.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=UEzgQ26W4hE The Russian Navy is also in the process of acquiring new Borei-A- class nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines, improved subvariants of the original Borei class design that first entered service in 2013. “Our new reality is that when our sailors toss the lines over and set sail, they can expect to be operating in a contested space once they leave Norfolk,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Andrew “Woody” Lewis, then head of 2nd Fleet, had said last year about the overall situation as the Navy sees it. “Our ships can no longer expect to operate in a safe haven on the East Coast or merely cross the Atlantic unhindered to operate in another location.” In addition, Russia has a significant fleet of specialized submarines, including deep-diving mini-submarines and highly modified mothership boats to carry them. There have long been concerns that the Kremlin could utilize those capabilities to tap or even attack sensitive undersea cable lines . Russia’s newest special mission submarine, the absolutely massive modified Oscar-II class Belgorod is also expected to be a launch platform for the Poseidon nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed long-range torpedo, a novel strategic weapon you read more about here . There are a number of other Russian unmanned underwater vehicles known to be in development that it could use to undertake various missions, as well. The Navy, as well as the U.S. military as a whole, is also increasingly concerned about Russian naval activity in the Arctic and in the Pacific . However, China, which is in the midst of a massive effort to expand and modernize its naval capabilities , including the acquisition of new advanced submarines , is the predominant near-peer competitor in the Pacific. American officials have also been pointing to the potential for increased Chinese naval operations in the Arctic , and even possibly into the Atlantic , as time goes on. Other U.S. adversaries, such as North Korea and Iran , are also working to expand their subsurface capabilities and advanced submarine technology is proliferating more and more , in general, around the world. Submarines, and the capabilities they offer and the threats they present, have been a general topic of increased interest recently with the announcement that Australia has begun working with the United States and the United Kingdom to acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines . All told, it is hardly surprising that the Navy has stood up a force of surface ships dedicated to anti-submarine operations in the Atlantic. The creation of Task Group Greyhound may well presage the establishment of similar units elsewhere, especially in the Pacific, as concerns about potential hostile submarine activity from Russia and China, among others, continues to grow.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s beleaguered Boeing KC-46 Pegasus tanker program hit yet another snag earlier this year. Deliveries were halted for around a month after plastic debris was found inside an internal fuel line in one of the aircraft as it flew to its future home in North Carolina. The small red cap jammed a valve open, causing an uncontrolled fuel transfer between tanks. Bloomberg News was first to report this new development with Boeing’s long-troubled KC-46A. Aviation Week ‘s Brian Everstein subsequently Tweeted out that the aircraft in question was a Pegasus that touched down at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina on April 30, 2021. A Tweet at the time from that base’s 916th Air Refueling Wing, an Air Force Reserve unit, said that the plane had arrived safe and sound without mention of any problems. This foreign object debris, or FOD, and the problems stemming from it, appear to have been discovered during the KC-46A’s flight to Seymour Johnson, but it is unclear what, if any, risk this presented to the crew or whether there was any lasting damage to the aircraft. The Pegasus’ crew “was not able to stop the transfer of fuel as desired” and the issue “was found to be caused by foreign object debris — a red plastic cap — that had become lodged in the right main tank shut-off valve,” Captain Samantha Morrison, an Air Force spokesperson, told Bloomberg . “A shortfall was identified in the previous inspection process, and additional layers of inspections have been added,” she continued. The Air Force officer indicated the service had received Boeing’s assurances that the Air Force would not receive any more aircraft with debris in them. This last promise is significant, given how much trouble the company has had with FOD in their planes in recent years . This is not even the first time debris has been found in a KC-46A fuel tank. In June 2020, the Air Force Times reported inspectors had found foreign objects in a KC-46 fuel tank, delaying delivery of another Pegasus to Seymour Johnson. However, the Air Force told that outlet at the time that it determined this discovery had stemmed from “non-standard factory rework,” rather than “production line quality escapes” of the kind that had led to another pause in deliveries of these tankers in March 2019. Aviation Week ‘s Everstein had noted on Twitter that Boeing had failed to deliver two KC-46s before sending the one to Seymour Johnson in April. The Air Force had said “the company could not present ready aircraft,” he wrote. “AFLCMC [The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center] said there was ‘moderate risk’ for this April 30 delivery.” The KC-46A production line is not the only part of Boeing to experience similar issues in recent years, either. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that inspectors found empty tequila bottles one of two future Air Force One aircraft — more properly known as a VC-25B — at the company’s San Antonio, Texas, plant. Last year, it was separately reported that inspections found debris in the fuel tanks of almost two-thirds of undelivered 737 Max aircraft, after the aircraft was grounded because of software problems implicated in several fatal crashes. And Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner has also had its own production debris issues. For years now, the KC-46A has been beset by problems well beyond quality control, as well, as The War Zone has written about at length. The Air Force itself has described the program as a lemon out of which the service is trying “to make lemonade.” Most notable among the many issues, some of which have been resolved , are problems that impact the ability of the tanker to perform its primary mission, mid-air refueling. The aircraft still has significant issues both in the design of its refueling boom and with the Remote Vision System (RVS) that operators use to steer it into receiving aircraft, as you can learn more about here . Unlike with previous Air Force tankers, boom operators on KC-46As sit in the main cabin rather than in a position at the rear of the plane and use a complex hybrid 2D/3D system to “see” what’s going on behind the aircraft and perform their tasks. Fixes are in the works for both of these issues, but are years away from being implemented across the fleet. The KC-46A Pegasus is derived from Boeing’s commercial 767 airliner, which has been in service since 1982. A tanker version of the 767, the KC-767, was developed in the 2000s for foreign air arms and has been in service with Italy and Japan for years, but the USAF wanted to build a significantly different configuration for its own program to begin replacing the Air Force’s elderly KC-135 aircraft. The selection of what is now known as the KC-46 was a major saga in itself that lasted more than a decade. The Air Force plans to purchase as many as 179 of the Boeing tankers and has taken delivery of at least 47 of them so far. But even as the KC-46 program scrambles to reach full functionality, with updated booms and enhanced remote vision systems still years away, the service is already looking beyond the challenging program to add new tankers, which The War Zone wrote about in June and just last week . This program could involve into everything from an Airbus A330-based tanker to more KC-46s delivered in a more mature configuration. In the meantime, the venerable KC-135 fleet soldiers on, as well as a decreasing cadre of KC-10s. Brian O'Rourke and Joseph Trevithick"
Brian O'Rourke and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 5, 2022",DARPA Reveals Successful Hypersonic Cruise Missile Flight Test Has Occurred,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has announced the successful free flight test of an air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile demonstrator developed by Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. This comes more than a year after the announcement of successful captive-carry tests of this weapon, as well as a competing design from Lockheed Martin , as part of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept program, or HAWC. The announcement of this test of the Raytheon/Northrop Grumman missile came earlier today in a press release , but the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), working together with the U.S. Air Force, conducted it last week. The U.S. Navy was also involved in the test. DARPA’s official statement does not provide any update on any similar progress on the Lockheed Martin design. An artist’s conception of an air-breathing hypersonic missile that DARPA previously released in relation to the HAWC program., DARPA “The HAWC free flight test was a successful demonstration of the capabilities that will make hypersonic cruise missiles a highly effective tool for our warfighters,” Andrew “Tippy” Knoedler, the HAWC Program Manager at DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, said in a statement. “This brings us one step closer to transitioning HAWC to a program of record that offers next generation capability to the U.S military.” “Goals of the mission were: vehicle integration and release sequence, safe separation from the launch aircraft, booster ignition and boost, booster separation and engine ignition, and cruise,” DARPA’s press release added. “All primary test objectives were met.” Details about the Raytheon/Northrop Grumman design are limited. Little information has been released as to this weapon’s overall performance, as well. Hypersonic speed is simply defined as anything above Mach 5. We do know that is the main source of power is a scramjet engine, a type of propulsion that only works effectively at very high speeds, to begin with. As such, as DARPA noted in its description of the test goals, the missile requires a rocket booster to provide an initial burst of acceleration before the scramjet kicks in. The scramjet engine takes advantage of high-speed airflow through a combustor to produce large amounts of thrust. The underlying ramjet engine lacks the spinning compressors typically found on jet engines and instead uses inlet and internal geometry to compress and accelerate the airflow through the engine. A scramjet ups the ante compared to a ramjet by forcing the airflow inside at supersonic speeds. Fuel is then injected into the supersonic air and ignited. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have said in the past that the overall design of the missile leverages past work the companies have done on hypersonic aerospace vehicles, including the X-43A hypersonic test vehicle project for NASA that ran from the 1990s to the early 2000s. DARPA also specifically highlighted its past work on the Rockwell X-30 National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) project in the 1980s and 1990s. The scramjet engine inside the Raytheon/Northrop Grumman missile is also reportedly half the weight of the one found inside the X-51 Waverider , another hypersonic test vehicle that Boeing developed for DARPA 2000s and that was flight tested in the 2010s. The test last week marks the first successful flight, at least that has been made public, of a U.S. scramjet-powered air vehicle since 2013. The fourth and only fully successful test flight of the X-51A took on May 1 of that year. It is worth pointing out that Lockheed Martin’s design follows the same general concept, using a rocket booster to accelerate the main air vehicle, which is powered by a different scramjet developed by Aerojet Rocketdyne. What was then Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne had developed the SJY61 scramjet for the X-51A. Lockheed Martin is now in the process of trying to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne. An artist’s conception of a hypersonic missile that Lockheed Martin previously released that is related to its HAWC design., Joseph Trevithick DARPA’s current plan is to wrap up the HAWC program in the 2022 Fiscal Year, which starts on Friday. At that point, the plan is, at least in part, for technologies developed under HAWC to feed into the Air Force’s own Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) project. HACM is just one of a number of air-launched, air-breathing hypersonic weapon programs, as well as hypersonic aircraft projects , known to be in development now within the Air Force, as well as the Navy. This includes another Air Force project known as Mayhem , which is focused more on hypersonic engine technology, and a Navy effort called Screaming Arrow. The Navy had curiously canceled Screaming Arrow , which was centered on the development of a hypersonic anti-ship missile, in March, before rebooting it last month . It’s also worth noting that DARPA had originally hoped to begin HAWC flight testing by the end of 2020 and it’s not clear how mature either the Raytheon/Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin designs may be now. DARPA did not say whether the launch of the Raytheon/Northrop Grumman demonstrator last week was the first flight test of any HAWC air vehicle, successful or not. Just last week, the Air Force also said it is in the process of reassessing its own hypersonic weapons plans , overall. Challenges with the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), which is unrelated to HAWC, have been among the issues prompting this introspection. The first two flight tests of the AGM-183A, which the Air Force hopes will be the U.S. military’s first operational air-launched hypersonic weapon, have failed, as you can read more about here . “I’m not satisfied with the pace,” Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said at the annual Air Force Association (AFA) Air, Space, and Cyber Conference last week. “We’re making some progress on the technology. I would like to see it be better.” At the same time, some members of Congress are pushing the U.S. military, as a whole, to make more progress with regard to air-launched hypersonic capabilities of various kinds, and air-breathing platforms in particular. A report accompanying the Senate Armed Services Committee’s markup of a draft of the annual U.S. defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was released last week , said, “The committee is concerned that there is a lack of focus on air-launched and airbreathing hypersonic capability.” The U.S. military, as well as many lawmakers, see hypersonic weapons as essential to preserving America’s military edge in future conflicts , especially potential high-end fights against near-peer adversaries, such as Russia or China. The Russians and the Chinese are already in the process of developing and fielding their own hypersonic missiles of various types . No matter what, work on HAWC has always been seen as just one stepping stone to the Air Force, as well as the Navy, fielding operational air-breathing cruise missiles. With this disclosure of this flight test last week, we may now begin to learn more about the exact extent of the progress that DARPA has already made in this regard.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 20, 2021",China’s Massive 11-Barrel Naval Gatling Gun Has Been Adapted For Close-In Defense On Land,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has unveiled a new 11-barrel version of its ground-based 30mm air-defense system, with a trailer-mounted adaptation seemingly optimized for the point-defense of key installations. The new weapon, and its seven-barrel predecessor, are both based on existing shipborne anti-aircraft artillery systems . Although the exact capabilities of the new weapon are unconfirmed, the 11-barrel mobile Gatling-style cannon would be effective against low-flying helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and cruise missiles, as well as offering a powerful counter to the growing threat posed by small drones . Furthermore, it could even fulfill a role similar to the U.S.-developed Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system. Video footage of the trailer-mounted gun appeared in the run-up to Airshow China in the southern city of Zhuhai, which formally opens tomorrow and runs until October 3. The system has been developed by the NORINCO Group, a Chinese state-owned defense corporation that produces a wide array of artillery and small arms, as well as various types of munitions . VIA TWITTER The new ground-based system, the designation of which is not currently known, has been developed from the Type 1130 shipborne anti-aircraft artillery mounting, itself apparently inspired by the Dutch Goalkeeper close-in weapon system (CIWS, pronounced “sea-whizz”), which uses the same size ammunition as the A-10 Warthog’s GAU-8 Avenger cannon . The Type 1130 is one of several types of gun-based naval CIWS developed by China. Others include the smaller Type 730 that features a seven-barrel 30mm cannon as well as an enormous 20-barrel weapon that appeared earlier this year and which is apparently still in the developmental phase. An example of the Type 1130 CIWS aboard the Chinese frigate Wuhu ., Rhk111/Wikimedia Commons The Type 1130 was first seen on China’s first aircraft carrier , the Liaoning , and has also been installed on other Chinese warships, providing a last line of defense, primarily against incoming anti-ship missiles. These same capabilities lend the Type 1130 gun to various land-based roles, too. The previous seven-barrel Type 730 has also been adapted as a truck-mounted version, known as the LD-2000, another NORINCO product. Primarily intended to destroy cruise missiles and precision-guided bombs, the LD-2000 is fielded by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as the last line of defense for key installations, such as command posts and radar sites. Some versions of the system also add six TY-90 infrared-guided missiles to provide another means of prosecuting aerial targets. A fire-control radar and electro-optical sensor are included on the truck, which can operate independently or as part of a group. The LD-2000 ground-based air defense system., Tyg728/Wikimedia Commons The Type 730 weapon used in the LD-2000 has a reported rate of fire of around 4,000 rounds per minute and a maximum range of about 1.8 miles, although targets are more likely to be engaged at between 0.6 miles and 1 mile. In comparison, the 11-barrel Type 1130 offers a similar engagement range but is credited with a rate of fire of 10,000 rounds per minute, according to local media accounts, meaning it should provide a significantly greater destructive effect or better sustained fire. A degree of commonality between a naval CIWS and a ground-based air-defense system is not without precedent, of course. The ubiquitous six-barrel 20mm Vulcan employed in the Phalanx naval CIWS was also used in the Vulcan Air Defense System (VADS) that was introduced into U.S. Army service as long ago as 1967. More recently, the same basic gun was adopted under the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) program that created the aforementioned Centurion, although this is a very different concept and yielded a much more cumbersome and complex system than VADS. In Taiwan, meanwhile, thought has been given to adapting Phalanx to defend against potential Chinese attacks, with a land-based version to protect its airbases, as you can read about here . It’s unclear whether the new ground-based version of the Type 1130 is intended to perform a similar role to the existing LD-2000, which is primarily concerned with destroying air-launched weapons, and other cruise missiles, or if it’s intended to have a broader mission spectrum, encompassing the C-RAM mission. The latter is at least a possibility, which could make the new system something like an equivalent to the U.S.-designed Centurion system. The Centurion C-RAM system: In the past, The War Zone has looked in detail at the Centurion, and you can read more about it, and see it in action, here . The Centurion was rushed into service after a crash development program in 2004, to meet an urgent need to defeat rockets and other projectiles during the insurgency in Iraq. As a point-defense weapon, Centurion is employed in close proximity to friendly forces, typically defending fixed installations such as military bases or even the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Another role is to provide a lower tier of defense to protect more advanced and longer-range air-defense systems, such as the Patriot . Employing a version of the well-known 20mm Vulcan cannon, which is used in numerous American fighters built over the decades from the F-104 to the F-22 Raptor, the Centurion puts up a wall of fire to swat lower-end artillery shells, mortar rounds, and rockets. While a 30mm cannon, as used in the Chinese CIWS offers greater destructive power and range than the 20mm ammunition used in the Phalanx and its land-based iterations, regardless of caliber, these kinds of weapons all have a fairly limited radius. But when fielded as part of a multi-layered air-defense system, or as a point-defense solution for a particular installation, then that’s not necessarily a problem. Having radar and electro-optical sensors on the same truck chassis means the Chinese system is self-contained and doesn’t have to be plugged into a larger network, although that could be advantageous in some scenarios. The particular ammunition used in the new Chinese system would also help determine its lethal radius. To ensure that the Centurion’s own fire doesn’t cause destruction to the surrounding area, a special Multipurpose Tracer-Self Destruct (MPT-SD) round is used, which lack the range and ‘stopping power’ of the tungsten-cored armored piercing discarding-sabot (APDS) round used in the naval Phalanx. It could be that the Chinese system makes a similar tradeoff, or it may be that the original non-self-destructing ammunition is retained. A close-up of the 11-barrel cannon in its truck-mounted form. , VIA TWITTER The proliferation of drones is also a likely driver behind the development of the new 11-barrel system. The threat posed by swarming drones is one that has not gone unnoticed by China, which is one of the leading players in that field . Loitering munitions are in the ascendancy in the Asia Pacific region, with the Israeli-made Harop , in particular, proliferating there in both land and sea domains, and with Taiwan also developing loitering munitions of its own. Moreover, the hurdles to exporting a counter-drone system are likely fairly low and, especially after the experience of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict last year, this is a threat that is fast becoming a high priority outside of China, too. Whatever role the new Chinese truck-mounted system is intended to fulfill, it’s clear that, if adopted for service, it would offer capabilities in excess of those of the current LD-2000, at least as far as the gun armament is concerned. Equally, there is no reason why short-range surface-to-air missiles couldn’t be added, as on the earlier system, to provide another option against low-level aerial threats. In fact, the continuing Chinese focus on short-range air defense (SHORAD) systems that can detect, track, and engage smaller targets in all weathers, is in stark contrast to the U.S. approach, where this class of weapon has been neglected since the end of the Cold War. This is of particular concern as the drone threat continues to proliferate and it’s a topic that we have discussed in depth in the past . Meanwhile, there is a growing interest in C-RAM solutions, which could have prompted NORINCO to market this system now. As well as Centurion, solutions include other larger caliber automated gun systems , as well as new directed energy (laser) C-RAM systems, and the missile-based Israeli Iron Dome . As far as laser air-defense systems are concerned, NORINCO also offers a truck-based solution — in this case, intended primarily to destroy low-flying drones: For now, it’s not certain whether the new ground-based 11-barrel 30mm weapon will enter PLA service, or if it’s actually aimed primarily at the export market, but a system like this makes perfect sense as a rapid means of countering a variety of low-altitude threats in the region, as well as being broadly applicable in other potential conflict zones, too. Ultimately, it is another indication of the seriousness with which Beijing takes the proliferation of aerial threats, with an impressive arsenal of air-defense systems that can address threats ranging from high-speed, high-altitude air-breathing aircraft, all the way down to air-launched missiles, drones, and potentially now also low-end threats like shells, mortar rounds, and rockets.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 26, 2021",The Navy Has Received Its First Block III F/A-18 Super Hornets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has announced the delivery of the first two operational F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets in the Block III configuration to the U.S. Navy. That service will now use these aircraft to help complete an ongoing test and evaluation program for these updates, as well as support the development of new tactics, techniques, and procedures to go with them. The Navy expects to begin sending improved Super Hornets to actual frontline units before the end of the year. The Navy received this pair of Block III F/A-18E/Fs, the first of 78 new-production jets the service currently has on order, earlier this month , according to Boeing. The company had already delivered two test jets with some of the Block III improvements to the Navy last year. The service is set to put a significant portion of its existing 540 Super Hornets through an upgrade program to bring them up to this standard, as well. “The fleet needs capabilities to keep its edge,” Navy Captain Jason “Stuf” Denney, the service’s program manager for both the F/A-18 and EA-18G Growler aircraft, said in a Boeing press release. “Getting the first operational Block III in our hands is a great step forward in supporting our capability and readiness goals.” The complete Block III package includes a diverse array of improvements over the Navy’s existing Super Hornets. The jets have new, highly customizable, wide-area, touchscreen multifunction displays, including in the front and rear cockpits on two-seat F/A-18Fs. The aircraft also have the open-architecture Distributed Targeting Processor-Networked (DTP-N), which gives the aircraft’s mission computer more processing power and networking capability, as well as the Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) data link. Block III Super Hornets have certain features to help reduce the jet’s radar signature, as well. You can read more about the entire package in detail in this past War Zone feature . Beyond all that, this program has rolled in two other updates that had previously been in the works for future Navy Super Hornets, these being an improved satellite communications (SATCOM) system and the integration of a podded infrared search and track (IRST) system. In addition, Navy Block II Super Hornets that will be upgraded are set to go through a Service Life Modification (SLM) process first, extending their expected lifespan from 6,000 to 10,000 total flight hours. An infographic showing components of the Block III package, as well as other planned upgrades for the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets., Boeing The original plan had been to include range-extending conformal fuel tanks (CFT) to the Navy’s Super Hornets as part of the Block III package. However, the service uncovered unspecified issues when it sent the test jets to fly from the deck of an actual carrier last year. Boeing subsequently received a stop-work halting continued testing of the CFTs in January and it is unclear when, if ever, they might eventually make their way onto Block III jets. You can read more about what we know of the issues with the CFTs and the impacts that it might have on the Navy’s future plans for its carrier air wings here . A Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet fitted with conformal fuel tanks during testing., Boeing capture Regardless, the remaining Block III and other associated upgrades for the Navy’s Super Hornets are set to help ensure that those jets can continue to be an important part of the Navy’s carrier air wings going forward. Boeing says that the use of open-architecture systems, such as DTP-N, also opens up pathways for the rapid integration of new and updated functionality for various systems on the jets as time goes on. “The hardware upgrades are complete. Today we are maximizing the open hardware and software and developing the apps to keep Block III ahead of future threats,” Jen Tebo, Boeing’s Vice President of F/A-18 and EA-18G programs, said in the press release regarding the delivery of the first operational upgraded jets. ”We are giving Navy pilots the tools to make the fastest and most informed decisions possible now and in the future.” Boeing has already demonstrated how the TTNT link can be used to support future manned-unmanned teaming . Artificial intelligence-driven capabilities to improve pilots’ decision-making abilities are another possibility, Tebo had told reporters during a roundtable last week. Tebo also noted that Boeing is leveraging work done on the Block III configuration to help with future updates to the EA-18G and to support the development of a future fighter to meet emerging Navy requirements as part of that service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. “If you think about where the capabilities are going in the future, it’s certainly around the airframe, certainly around the survivability piece, stealth technology piece. But the meat and potatoes in the future are really going to be around the networking and the mission systems, and this sets up the Super Hornet to be the risk-reducer and the bridge to get to Next Gen Air Dominance,” she said at the roundtable. From top to bottom: an F/A-18E Super Hornet, an F/A-18F Super Hornet, and an EA-18G Growler., Boeing How the Navy’s NGAD program evolves may have an impact on any future F/A-18E/F plans, and the service already wants to stop buying new Super Hornets, a shift in focus that has drawn skepticism from members of Congress. As it stands now, the Navy has around 540 Super Hornets, in total, but it’s unclear how many of those will ultimately be brought up to the Block III standard. For its part, Boeing says it expects to be delivering improved jets into the 2030s, with these aircraft coming from one of three lines. One is for new production Super Hornets incorporating the Block III features, while the other two will put existing Navy jets through the SLM and then the Block III upgrade process. Boeing is also now offering Block III Super Hornets, or at least jets with some of the elements of this package, to foreign customers, such as Canada and India . The Super Hornets that Kuwait recently received, the last of which were delivered this month , had included components — such as the new cockpit displays — that are now going into Block III jets, as well. Regardless, the Navy sees Super Hornets as a key component of its carrier air wings for years to come, and the units flying these jets are set to start receiving a significant boost in capability in the coming months with the arrival of aircraft in the Block III configuration.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 29, 2021",China’s Big New Twin-Jet Long-Endurance Armed Combat Drone Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China’s big international airshow in Zhuhai hasn’t even officially kicked off yet, but we are already getting a peek at what is going to be displayed there. One new development is China’s J-16D electronic attack jet being seen with jamming pods for the first time. Now we are getting our first lifesize view of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation’s Cai Hong (Rainbow) 6, better known by its designation CH-6. It is a long-endurance, twin-jet engine, multirole drone. In the past, we have only seen models and low-fidelity renderings of the design. The CH-6 is considered to be a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) unmanned system designed for intelligence gathering, support, and strike roles. It looks almost something like a drastically enlarged CH-5 , but its rear configuration is very different from that earlier design. It has a high T-tail setup, with two jet engines installed atop the tail section side-by-side. The drone’s mid-set long wings are also a bit swept and the entire package sits atop tall landing gear. The aircraft also has a notable chine-line-like edge that wraps around its ellipse-shaped fuselage. According to China-Arms.com , which claims to have the basic information that will be displayed about the CH-6 at the airshow, its stats include: The CH-6 UAV’s parameters include maximum takeoff weight of 7.8 tons, maximum load capacity of 300 kg (reconnaissance type) or 2 tons (reconnaissance-attack type), fuel capacity of 3.42 tons (reconnaissance type) or 1.72 tons (reconnaissance-attack type), overall length of 15 meters, wingspan of 20.5 meters, height of 5 meters, maximum level flight speed of 800 km/h, cruise speed of 500 km/h to 700 km/h, cruise altitude of 10 km, ceiling of 12 km, a maximum endurance of 20 hours (reconnaissance type) or 8 hours (reconnaissance-attack type), a maximum range of 12,000 km (reconnaissance type) or 4,500 km (reconnaissance-attack type), a maximum climb rate of 20 m/s, and an operating radius (apparent) of 300 km. Via China-Arms.com The CH-6 seems to be situated in a capability space between its medium-altitude, medium-endurance, unstealthy unmanned combat aircraft brethren — as well as China’s long-endurance, m edium-altitude, propeller-powered surveillance types — and more advanced high-altitude, long-endurance intelligence-gathering and sensor craft jet-powered drones. The fact that it will be capable of being armed from the outset is a clear indication that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force is looking to push its unmanned kinetic capabilities farther afield than what is possible now. The aircraft’s jet speed will favorably impact transit times to patrol or target areas and maximize its endurance once there. Two engines would increase reliability, as well, which could be key considering the distances involved with operating an aircraft like this and the less-developed state of Chinese jet engine technology. In fact, the most similar of China’s unmanned aircraft we know of to the CH-6 is probably the Cloud Shadow. It is a single jet engine design that also has a lot in common with previous Chinese propeller-driven combat drone designs, but is smaller and lighter than the CH-6. Both aircraft can accomplish surveillance and kinetic missions, but the CH-6 would likely be even better suited for the former due to its size and weight, allowing multiple sensor systems — and large ones at that — to be carried over long distances and at higher altitudes. Chengdu Cloud Shadow., Mztourist/Wikicommons As far as the United States goes, the closest thing to the CH-6 is probably General Atomics’ Avenger, although the CH-6 puts less emphasis on low-observability in its design and appears capable of higher altitude operations for some mission types. The Avenger could probably be better classed as somewhere between the CH-6 and Cloud Shadow, in limited respects. Also, the CH-6 is a simpler overall design. This is a big deal, as it could provide China with an ‘everyday’ high-altitude, long-endurance platform that is not very sensitive in nature or expensive to procure and operate. It can be a platform that potentially provides a kinetic punch but can also haul around larger sensors and other payloads when required, all with twin jet engine reliability. Once again, this would fill the unmanned flying ‘sensor truck’ gap that exists between aircraft like the more advanced jet-powered Soar Dragon and the lower-performance propeller-powered TB-001. Being far from exquisite, especially compared to some of the stealthy unmanned aircraft China is currently pursuing , means that the CH-6 can also probably be bought, and even lost, in significant numbers. With that in mind, the CH-6 may not be sexy or cutting-edge, but it could prove to be extremely important to the PLA’s long-range ambitions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 27, 2022",Rolls Royce Will Provide Long-Awaited New Jet Engines For The B-52 Bomber Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has revealed that the U.S. Air Force has chosen Rolls-Royce’s North American division to supply F130 turbofans to re-engine its fleet of B-52H bombers. This upgrade program, which has been years , if not decades, in the making, is a major milestone for the service’s B-52H fleet and will help ensure those bombers keeping flying through 2050. Details about the deal were included in today’s edition of the Pentagon’s daily contracting notice, which includes information about all awards valued over $7.5 million. Rolls-Royce’s new contract from the Air Force is valued at $500,870,458 over the next six years but could grow to over $2.6 billion if all of its options are exercised. “This contract provides for 608 commercial engines plus spare engines, associated support equipment and commercial engineering data, to include sustainment activities, to be used on the B-52H bomber fleet,” according to the Pentagon’s announcement. “The location of performance is Indianapolis, Indiana, and work is expected to be completed by Sept. 23, 2038.” The total number of engines cited here, 608, is exactly enough for one-for-one replacements of the eight Pratt and Whitney TF33 engines found on each of the Air Force’s 76 B-52H bombers. To help keep costs low, the Air Force had required the companies competing for the re-engining deal to submit proposals that would be able to leverage the aircraft’s four existing underwing engine pods, each of which holds two TF33s. Other modifications to the bombers are planned as part of the upgrade process . A B-52H bomber., USAF Rolls-Royce is confident that the F130s will not need to be completely replaced throughout the rest of the expected service life of the Air Force’s B-52Hs, but it still seems likely the Air Force will want to buy spares as time goes on to ensure it has extra engines should it need them. The F130 beat out General Electric’s CF34-10 and Pratt and Whitney’s PW800 to secure this deal. Pratt and Whitney was effectively the incumbent in this competition, though the TF33 engine that powers the B-52H now has been out of production since 1985. The company has continued to provide support for TF33s found on B-52Hs and other Air Force aircraft since then, but at an ever-growing cost. As of 2016, the Air Force was spending approximately $2 million per engine to overhaul TF33s every 6,000 flight hours. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HRbFv22sMMM This was an important driver in the Air Force’s decision to move forward with this re-engining plan starting in 2017. The service had previously explored replacing the engines on these bombers but had decided against doing so. The TF33, which has powered the B-52H since the very first of these bombers entered service in the 1960s, is also just a dated, inefficient, low-bypass design. “Once installed, the F130 will provide vastly greater fuel efficiency while increasing range and reducing tanker aircraft requirements,” Rolls-Royce’s website notes. This was another major factor for the Air Force in deciding whether or not to proceed with the re-engining effort. When it comes to cost, the F130 also has the benefit of being an established in-production design. F130 is the military designation for Rolls-Royce’s popular BR700, thousands of examples of which power a variety of different business jets, as well as the Boeing 717 airliner. U.S. military C-37A and B aircraft — designations applied to Gulfstream V and 550s, respectively — as well as the Air Force’s Bombardier BD-700-based E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft, already use versions of this engine, further simplifying maintenance and logistics chains. Regardless, new engines of any kind are a major milestone in the B-52’s already impressively long career and will be critical to ensuring the bombers can continue to serve the Air Force for decades to come. The re-engining is just one of a number of upgrades these aircraft are expected to receive in the coming years, which you can read more about here . Their already diverse arsenal is set to grow substantially , including with the addition of new hypersonic missiles . All told, the addition of new F130 engines to the Air Force’s B-52Hs is one of, if not the most significant upgrades these aircraft have ever received and is a huge, long-awaited step forward toward this new phase of their service life.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 9, 2020",China’s J-16D Electronic Attack Jet Seen Sporting Jamming Pods For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 2021 Zhuhai Airshow in China doesn’t officially kick off until next week, but the setup for the event has already started, and pictures are emerging of the aircraft and other systems that will be on display. One particularly significant arrival that has been spotted so far is an example of the J-16D electronic warfare jet, which is often compared in broad strokes to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler . The Chinese jet has what appears to be at least three different and previously unseen electronic warfare pods on pylons under its wings and fuselage. This year’s Zhuhai Airshow is the first time the J-16D will be on public display in any configuration, which made its appearance earlier this week notable to begin with. The Chinese government routinely shows off new aircraft and highlights certain advanced capabilities of existing designs at this event, which has been occurring biennially since 1996. This particular iteration of the show was supposed to occur last fall but was postponed in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The J-16D, which is derived from the two-seat J-16 fighter jet — itself an improved Chinese derivative of the Soviet Su-27 Flanker design — reportedly first flew in December 2015. The J-16D may also be linked to the J-15D, a two-seat electronic warfare version of China’s carrier-based J-15 Flanker derivative . The D variant differs from the basic J-16 in a number of significant ways, including a redesigned radome that experts and observers have suggested might point to the aircraft carrying an advanced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The nose-mounted infrared search and track (IRST) system and internal 30-mm cannon found on the standard J-16 fighter have also been removed on the D version, reportedly to help make room for a robust internal electronic warfare system. These changes are similar to what has also been seen on the J-15D. The jet also has a number of antennas on all sides of its fuselage and features wingtip pods that are broadly reminiscent of the ones seen on the EA-18G. Though the exact capabilities of the J-16D’s internal electronic warfare suite are unknown, the EA-18G’s wingtip pods are part of that aircraft’s internal AN/ALQ-218 system. The complete AN/ALQ-218 suite has radar warning receiver (RWR), electronic support measures (ESM), and electronic intelligence (ELINT) functionality, giving the Growler a comprehensive ability to detect, categorize, and geolocate enemy radars and other hostile emitters, as well as collect data about the signals they are putting out. A very general overview of the electronic warfare and other systems found on the EA-18G Growler., RAAF Though it has long been expected that the J-16D, like the EA-18G, would supplement these onboard electronic warfare capabilities with external pods, the pictures from Zhuhai appear to be the first official confirmation of this and our first look at what the jet’s full operational configuration might look like. At least three different types of pods are visible. The ones under the wings appear to share a similar core shape, but the example under the left wing has a number of external blade-type antennas under its front end. The pods under the fuselage look to be very similar to each other but may also have some differences. While it is unclear what the capabilities of each of these pods might be, that the Chinese would develop multiple types for the J-16D makes perfect sense. The EA-18G currently uses two variants of the AN/ALQ-99 pod , one of which is designed to jam high-band emitters, while the other is focused on low-band ones. The U.S. Navy is now in the process of developing a new family of electronic warfare pods for the Growler, which adds in a mid-band-focused type . You can read more about the Navy’s Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) program, as a whole, here . An overview of the high and low-band AN/ALQ-99 pods currently in use with the EA-18G Growler., RAAF An EA-18G Growler conducts a test flight carrying a pair of new NGJ-Mid-Band (NGJ-MB) pods, one under each wing, as well as an AN/ALQ-99 pod on the centerline., USN Having multiple pods optimized for different frequency bands offers advantages for attacking specific kinds of electronic threats and systems, such as fire-control radars that typically operate at higher frequencies ranges. Having more than one pod combined with an internal electronic warfare suite could give the J-16D the ability to engage more emitters at once, while also scooping up other useful information. If one or more of these pods is itself focused on other electronic intelligence capabilities, such as communications intelligence (COMINT), this would also give the jet valuable additional intelligence-gathering abilities and a better capability to jam the specific systems the pod focuses on. We have seen this with the Marine Corps’ Intrepid Tiger electronic warfare and intelligence family of podded systems, for instance. It’s also worth noting that an aircraft so equipped can potentially trigger cyber attacks on air-defense and communications systems, as well as provide electronic attacks and broad jamming support. The J-16D is also just one of a growing number of electronic warfare aircraft, including larger types based on cargo aircraft designs, available to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), as well. The Chinese military also has various existing self-protect electronic warfare pods that can be used on other combat jets and bombers. This mirrors, in broad respects, the layered aerial electronic warfare capabilities that the U.S. military fields, with aircraft like the EA-18G providing longer-range support to tactical aircraft, including stealth types, with their own organic capabilities that are operating inside enemy air-defense bubbles. Larger platforms then offer additional standoff jamming support. An extremely broad overview of the layers of aerial electronic warfare capability currently available to the U.S. military. The Chinese appear to be working on fielding a very similar set of capabilities, with the J-16D filling the same general role as the EA-18G., GAO It’s not hard at all to see a future where J-16Ds carrying an array of electronic warfare pods will serve in a similar role to the EA-18G when working with both non-stealthy combat jets, such as other J-16s, and the stealthy J-20, among other types. J-16Ds may eventually be able to launch kinetic attacks directly on emitters using anti-radiation missiles just like the Growler, as well. It’s also hardly surprising that the PLA would be looking to establish this kind of overall electronic warfare capacity, together with additional capabilities on the ground and at sea, given the security environment that the government in Beijing is looking at in the future both regionally and more globally. Aerial electronic warfare support would almost certainly be a major factor in any major Chinese military intervention across the Taiwan Strait given the island’s significant air-defense capabilities . These would be important capabilities to bring to bear in any larger-scale conflict against more prominent potential adversaries in the broader Indo-Pacific region, such as India or even the United States . Just this week, Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Frank Kendall specifically cited electronic warfare capabilities as being among the areas where the Chinese have been focusing on “increasing inventory levels and the sophistication of their weapons and modernizing redundant systems throughout the kill chains that support their weapons.” Air Force Lieutenant General Clint Hinote, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Integration, and Requirements, also said just days ago that “we are out of time” in terms of the PLA catching up to the capabilities of the U.S. military. Both men were speaking at this year’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, which the Air Force Association hosts in Washington, D.C. All told, while we don’t know the exact capabilities of the J-16D, or the newly unveiled pods that have been developed to go along with, the jet clearly reflects a broad push on the part of the PLA to develop new, robust electronic warfare assets as part of its larger modernization efforts.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 7, 2021",First Navy F-5 Aggressor Begins Upgrade That Will Make The Entire Fleet Far More Potent,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps set about overhauling their in-house red air adversary fleets , the first of three F-5N Tiger II aggressor aircraft set to undergo testing as part of a major upgrade program for the type arrived recently at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The improved F-5Ns will be better suited to replicate more advanced aerial threats and do so more reliably and safely. In the process, the Navy and Marine Corps are leveraging some of the capabilities that contractor red air providers have already introduced to the veteran F-5. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced that its Specialized and Proven Aircraft Program Office, or PMA-226, which is responsible for managing the upgrade, had delivered the aircraft to Pax River earlier this week. The aircraft is now set to be used for ground and flight tests of this block upgrade prototype project for the Navy’s F-5s, also known as Avionics Reconfiguration and Tactical Enhancement/Modernization for Inventory Standardization, or ARTEMIS. An F-5N from Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401 taxis on the flight line at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Kimberlyn Adams A photo the Navy released of the jet in question shows that it came from the service’s Fighter Squadron Composite 13 (VFC-13). It is not immediately clear to what degree the aircraft has already been upgraded under the ARTEMIS initiative. A Navy F-5N, apparently the first example delivered to NAS Patuxent River to start testing the ARTEMIS upgrade., U.S. Navy ARTEMIS overhauls the jets’ airframes and their twin J85-21 engines, and replaces their avionics. In their revised configuration, the latter will be based around an open-architecture system including a modernized cockpit. “This program will provide modernized aircraft with exceptional avionics and tactical capabilities which are needed to allow pilots to practice the tactics and techniques employed against a near-peer threat,” said Captain Ramiro Flores, the PMA-226 Program Manager. “Delivery of these improvements will ensure realistic and relevant tactical training the pilots need to win in combat.” As well as boosting the overall capability of the aggressor jets, the upgrade aims also to improve their reliability and safety while addressing the various obsolescence issues that are affecting the F-5s, which date back to the 1970s. The Navy and Marine Corps Tiger IIs previously served as frontline fighters with Switzerland, the current batch being the survivors of 44 former F-5E/Fs acquired between 2006 and 2009. But, as the Navy notes, the current configuration of the F-5 “lacks modern safety systems, avionics, and common tactical capabilities found in modern aircraft.” On the safety side, ARTEMIS provides the F-5 with a new ground-proximity warning system to alert pilots if the jet is in immediate danger of flying into the ground or an obstacle. Other warning systems will provide alerts for severe weather as well as fuel levels. To aid the aircraft’s primary aggressor mission, the upgrade will add “tactical capabilities designed to improve ‘friendly’ force air-to-air training,” according to the Navy. All this work is handled by Tactical Air Support, Inc., which has already made a name for itself as a contractor operating upgraded F-5s. The firm received a sole-source firm, fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract for the upgrades to Department of the Navy-owned F-5s, running from March 2021 through March 2026. As such, it’s expected the ARTEMIS package for the U.S. military will be based on, or at least broadly similar to, Tactical Air’s F-5 Advanced Tiger configuration , which the company applied to 21 former Jordanian F-5Es acquired in 2017. Those jets are already being used in support of Navy red air requirements at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, the home of TOPGUN . In winning that high-profile contract, Tactical Air was selected ahead of a rival bid based around fourth-generation F-16 fighter jets, a turn of events you can read more about here . One of Tactical Air’s F-5s., Tactical Air The Tactical Air upgrade makes extensive use of commercial off-the-shelf components, and the company describes it as follows: “Tactical Air’s F-5 Advanced Tiger (F-5AT) upgraded with HUD/HOTAS [head-up display and hands on throttle and stick controls], open architecture mission computers and tailored Operational Flight Programs that enable integration of Duotech’s Nemesis advanced radar and Argus RWR [radar warning receiver] systems, IRSTs [infrared search and track systems], EA [electronic attack], datalinks, and HOBS [high off-boresight] simulated weapons employment.” Other specific items in the F-5AT package include a Duotech mission computer, threat weapons engagement zone (WEZ) replication software suite, a color multifunction display (MFD), and Garmin moving-map display. Meanwhile, the open-architecture avionics allows for rapid integration of an external or internal jammer, captive missiles, a P5 air combat maneuvering instrumentation pod, and various items of air-to-ground ordnance. The Garmin 3000 integrated flight-deck suite as featured in Tactical Air’s remodeled F-5s., Garmin/Tactical Air We also know that Tactical Air’s F-5 pilots are equipped with Scorpion full-color helmet-mounted displays , increasing lethality during simulated HOBS engagements and better replicating potential adversaries, as well as giving the pilot much improved situational awareness. The end result, the company says, is a “fourth-generation adversary platform with third-generation economy.” You can read our previous in-depth report on TacAir’s F-5 avionics upgrade here. A TacAir F-5 pilot wearing the Scorpion HMD., Tactical Air Support Ultimately, the results of the test program will inform the upgrade work that’s going to be carried out on a total of 22 former Swiss Air Force Tiger IIs (16 single-seat F-5E and six dual-seat F-5F variants) that have been recently acquired to boost the adversary force available to the Navy and Marines, reflecting a growing demand for red air across the board. A Swiss Air Force F-5, 22 examples of which are now heading to the United States., RENÉ VINK Once they’ve undergone the ARTEMIS upgrade, the jets will be re-designated F-5N+ and F-5F+. A first upgraded Tiger II is reportedly expected to be delivered toward the end of next year. After work on the 22 recently acquired F-5s has been completed, the Navy plans to introduce the ARTEMIS upgrade on the existing Navy and Marine Corps F-5 aggressor fleet, covering a planned 40 aircraft. While they are not typically used to replicate high-end threats, the F-5 continues to be best suited to simulating low-to-mid level threats. The jets today serve with VFC-13 at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, and VFC-111 at Naval Air Station Key West, Florida, while the Marine examples are operated by Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401 (VMFT-401) at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. An F-5N assigned to Fighter Squadron Composite 111 lands at Boca Chica Field, Naval Air Station Key West, after training with Strike Fighter Squadron 122 in June last year., U.S. Navy/Danette Baso Silvers Tactical Air’s reworking of the Navy and Marine Corps aggressor F-5s will result in some of the most advanced Tiger IIs anywhere in the world. Already a tricky opponent on account of its small size and its agility, the jet is no match for today’s high-end fighters, but, once upgraded, will become a much more capable and flexible adversary. The War Zone has, in the past, looked in detail at the various capabilities that Tactical Air’s F-5 aggressor upgrade brings to the table. As well as the helmet-mounted display, the Nemesis pulse-Doppler radar is judged to be better than the AN/APG-66 radar used in contractor-operated A-4 Skyhawks , although it’s not at the same level as the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars beginning to appear in some jets in the private aggressor community. However, the Nemesis also has the potential to be upgraded with an AESA antenna in the future. Raytheon, for example, recently unveiled a compact, affordable AESA radar weighing a little over 100 pounds, that would seem to be pitched toward this segment of the adversary air market in particular. Some of the avionics found in the F-5AT, including the Duotech radar warning receiver suite and a pulse-Doppler radar., Duotech There have also been upgrades made to the existing F-5s , notably the “Red Net” tactical and situational awareness datalink introduced on the Marine Corps jets with VMFT-401. Based around a commercially available tablet-kneeboard display, this operates much like a heads-down situational display, feeding the pilot with information that can flow from other platforms — including those carrying more advanced radars and sensors, for example, even in a synthetic manner. The relatively cheap to operate upgraded F-5s combined with more advanced adversaries and electronic warfare support, as well as contracted aggressors, will be able to challenge fleet pilots with a saturated and dynamic threat presentation. This is highly important not just because of the rising capabilities of America’s adversaries, but also because of the increasing capabilities of the combat aircraft fleet pilots fly. Advanced sensors and data links, as well as better weaponry, have made it harder and harder to challenge them in the air with an increasingly geriatric aggressor force. This upgrade aims to help in that department. Of course, the Navy and Marines will not primarily be using their upgraded F-5s to represent the highest-level threats, leaving that job to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and to the F-16, and potentially even the F-35 . The War Zone was first to reveal plans for VFC-12 to upgrade from the “classic” Hornet to the Super Hornet, while the service is bringing in additional F-16 aggressor jets to Fallon to supplement the limited numbers of available F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-16A/B Vipers. As we understand it, some of these F-16s will fly with VFC-13, which now flies the F-5N. Thanks to the influx of 22 additional jets combined with the Tactical Air upgrade package, the F-5 is set to continue its formidable legacy as an aggressor jet, offering both numbers, economy, and a very useful level of capability, staying relevant even in the age of fifth-generation fighters and beyond.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 31, 2021",The Last Of 17 B-1B Bombers Slated For Early Retirement Has Arrived At The Boneyard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has successfully concluded the retirement of a group of 17 B-1B bombers , with the last of these aircraft arriving at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona yesterday. This divestiture plan, which Congress approved last year, is intended to help consolidate the B-1B fleet and improve its readiness rates ahead of the type’s complete replacement by the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . In a press release, Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) announced that the last of these 17 B-1Bs slated for retirement had left Edwards Air Force Base in California yesterday and headed to the Bone Yard. The bomber in question carried serial number 85-0074. The first bomber in this group to be retired had left Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota back in February . These divestments mean that the Air Force now has 45 of these aircraft in service, down from 62 at the beginning of the year. The service, which received a total of 100 B-1Bs in the 1980s, had previously retired 33 of them as part of an earlier consolidation effort between 2002 and 2003, and has lost others to accidents over the years. The B-1B bomber with the serial number 85-0074 ahead of its final flight from Edwards Air Force Base in California to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona on Sept. 23, 2021., USAF “The divesture plan was executed very smoothly,” Air Force Brigadier General Kenyon Bell, AFGSC’s Director of Logistics and Engineering, said in a statement. “With fewer aircraft in the B-1 fleet, maintainers will be able to give more time and attention to each aircraft remaining in the fleet.” “Continuous operations over the last 20 years have taken a toll on our B-1B fleet, and the aircraft we retired would have taken between 10 and 30 million dollars per aircraft to get back to a status quo fleet in the short term,” Bell added. Over the past two decades, the Air Force’s B-1Bs have seen heavy combat use in the now-concluded conflict in Afghanistan, as well as in Iraq and Syria, which took a notable toll on the readiness of the fleet. This had led to restrictions being imposed on how many hours each aircraft could fly annually, as well as what kind of maneuvers they could perform during training. The aircraft are notably maintenance intensive, to begin with, and are just becoming older and more difficult to sustain, in general. The entire fleet was grounded for a period of weeks earlier this year, something The War Zone was first to report , after a serious issue was found relating to the augmenter fuel pump filter housing related to the four F101-GE-102 engines on each jet. Of the 17 B-1Bs that were retired this year, only 13 went to the Bone Yard. The bulk of those aircraft are in so-called Type 4000 storage, which is relatively deep storage. However, four of them are being kept in Type 2000 “recallable storage,” which means that they will be maintained in a way that will make it easier to return them to service should that be necessary, due to any potential future combat losses or accidents. It is worth noting that Type 2000 storage is one step down from Type 1000 “inviolate storage,” which prohibits any part of the plane from being removed and used elsewhere in the interim, and that it can still take months to get aircraft kept in that condition flying again. Of the remaining four aircraft, one of them is now on display at the Global Power Museum at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. Another retired bomber went to Edwards Air Force Base to be used as a ground trainer. Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma received one that it will use as “a prototype for structural repair actions,” according to AFGCS. The National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR), part of Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas, also got one of the aircraft as part of a project to create so-called “digital twins” of the B-1B for use as digital engineering tools to support the continued development of upgrades and fixes for the remaining operational bombers in the years to come, which you can read more about here . The main portion of the fuselage of the retired B-1B bomber that the National Institute for Aviation Research received as part of the Air Force’s divestment plan., Wichita State University The digital twin effort at NAIR and the work being done at Tinker to improve depot-level repair processes are particularly important as the Air Force expects the B-1B to continue being a valuable long-range strike platform in the years to come, despite the fact that the type is now clearly entering the twilight of its career. Though the plan is to have the last of these bombers out of service by 2036, they are still expected to receive a number of new upgrades and improvements before then. This notably includes ongoing work to restore the B-1B’s ability to use a number of external pylons , which could be especially useful for carrying outsized stores, such as future hypersonic missiles . The Air Force has also been working to expand the missions these bombers can perform, including in the maritime domain through the integration of anti-ship weapons , such as the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). Being able to use these aircraft as launch platforms for hypersonic weapons or in a maritime role will still be operationally relevant in any potential future high-end conflict against a near-peer adversary, such as China or Russia, in the coming years. At the same time, “beginning to retire these legacy bombers allows us to pave the way for the B-21 Raider,” AFGSC’s Brigadier General Bell noted in his statement today. The Air Force’s overall bomber roadmap envisions the complete replacement of the B-1B fleet, as well as its existing B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, with B-21s. Upgraded B-52 bombers will also remain in service. Earlier this week, the service disclosed that a total of five pre-production Raiders are now in the final stages of being built, as that program progresses toward a first flight for the type. The first B-21s are expected to enter service in the mid-2020s. The most recent official artist’s conception of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber., USAF All told, while the B-1B still has an important role to play in the years to come, the Air Force’s completion of its latest trimming-back of the fleet does put the service that much closer to the final sunset for these swing-wing bombers.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 23, 2021",Top Air Force General In The Pacific Wants E-7 Wedgetails To Replace E-3 Radar Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. Air Force official has made a surprise call for acquiring Boeing E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft. General Kenneth S. Wilsbach, head of Pacific Air Forces, the service’s top command in that region, has recommended buying the new radar planes to help offset the aging E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, fleet. General Wilsbach made the call for acquiring the E-7s during the Air Force Association’s virtual Aerospace Warfare Symposium yesterday. A rapid procurement of the Wedgetails, he argued, would meet a demand for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. A Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail, foreground, alongside a U.S. Air Force E-3G at Williamtown, Australia, in September 2019., USAF “The fact is, we actually need something relatively quick because of the reliability of the E-3,” Wilsbach was quoted as saying by Air Force Magazine. “It gets harder and harder to get airborne.” Wilsbach was pointing to the fact that the E-3 — the first examples of which entered frontline use with the Air Force back in 1977 but have since been significantly upgraded — has one of the worst readiness rates in the service. A report that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, released last year, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , said that from Fiscal Year 2011 to Fiscal Year 2019, the Sentry fleet did not meet any of its annual aircraft availability goals. “The E-3 faces sustainment challenges related to supply of needed parts and maintenance of the aging aircraft,” the GAO analysis concluded. Upgrades to the Air Force’s E-3 fleet should keep the 40-year-old aircraft flying into the 2030s, but the aircraft is clearly showing its age. The most distinctive feature of the E-7, which is based on the airframe of the ubiquitous 737 airliner, is its large Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar, a Northrop Grumman product, mounted on the rear section of the top of the fuselage. It has air and sea-search modes and can track targets more than 370 miles away, depending on various environmental and other factors. In addition, it also has robust communications and data-sharing capabilities that allow it to exchange information with other friendly assets in the air and down below. The smaller 737-based design is more fuel-efficient and economical to operate than the larger Sentries. As a derivative of an in-production commercial aircraft, compared to the increasingly maintenance-intensive E-3, which is based on the long out-of-production Boeing 707 airliner, the Wedgetail has access to a well-established supply chain that could help reduce maintenance and logistics costs. In fact, all E-7s start life on the production line in civilian guise before being converted to their military configuration. Furthermore, the E-7 shares some commonality with other in-production U.S. military aircraft types. As well as the E-7, the 737-700 also serves as the basis for the U.S. Navy’s C-40 Clipper logistics transport, while the P-8 Poseidon maritime multi-mission aircraft is derived from the 737-800. A US Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane., U.S. Navy The potential for integration in future coalition operations is also an advantage, with the E-7 already being in service with Australia, South Korea , and Turkey. The United Kingdom is scheduled to receive its first Wedgetails in 2023. In order to speed up this process, the United Kingdom has notably chosen to use second-hand former commercial 737s as the basis for its first two Wedgetails. Wilsbach suggested he wants to see new E-7s supplanting the Sentry sooner rather than later, especially in the Indo-Pacific. In this region, in particular, U.S. air superiority is increasingly being threatened by China’s rapidly modernizing military, a reality that procurement of the E-7 could help address. China is developing extensive anti-access, area-denial strategies that incorporate long-range surface-to-air missiles and manned interceptors , as well as ballistic and cruise missiles . Against these kinds of threats, perhaps, Wilsbach says he envisages the future Pacific Air Forces equipped both with E-7s and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. NGAD is a highly anticipated sixth-generation combat aircraft effort that is being crafted around a sophisticated “system of systems,” as you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . Combined with new AEW&C assets, the NGAD would mean “that we can stay relevant as our adversaries continue to advance,” Wilsbach contended. “Air superiority is foundational to most other things that we would want to be able to do in our theater,” he said. “Because if you don’t have air superiority, then most everything else that you want to do is really held at risk.” An E-3 Sentry AWACS, from the 960th Expeditionary Airborne Air Control Squadron, flies over Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom., CENTCOM In the past, the Air Force has shown little apparent interest in buying the E-7 or even an alternative aircraft-based AEW&C capability as a direct replacement for the E-3. It is also worth noting that, in the past, upgraded Sentries were themselves also discussed as potentially being one part of a “distributed” approach to replacing the service’s E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield management command and control aircraft, or JSTARS. It is important to point out that the E-3s and E-8Cs perform very different missions. The E-3 — or any similar AEW&C platform, for that matter — relies upon a powerful radar able to scan vast swathes of airspace to detect any airborne threats, ranging from fast and high-flying manned aircraft to cruise missiles and drones; meanwhile, onboard controllers perform command and control functions. On the other hand, the JSTARS combines ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and synthetic aperture surveillance capabilities and is essentially a flying battlefield surveillance and management center. The system-of-systems approach to replacing JSTARS had emerged after plans to directly replace the JSTARS with another aircraft type — potentially also using a 737-derived design — were effectively abandoned in 2018. The Air Force has since continued to expand its distributed networking efforts, which have now evolved in the over-arching Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program. ABMS embodies the Air Force’s plans for a “distributed” combination of existing manned and unmanned aircraft with new sensors and other equipment. In the past The War Zone has considered exactly how feasible this concept is, bearing in mind the likely requirement for a new survivable sensor node to extend the reach of surveillance capabilities across heavily defended areas, especially against a near-peer opponent such as Russia or China . An E-8C Joint Stars on the flight line at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Davis Donaldson “The ABMS anticipates replacing the battle management functions of the Northrop Grumman E-8C Joint Stars fleet by 2025 with a network of sensors and processors distributed across multiple manned and unmanned platforms,” Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor Steve Trimble wrote last October. “The Air Force may seek to adopt the same [distributed] approach for replacing the AWACS fleet beyond 2025.” However, Trimble also noted that the Air Force might still opt for a more conventional successor to the E-3, perhaps KC-46 derivative, a platform based on the 737 (i.e. the E-7), or a smaller bizjet-based solution . The service could potentially acquire a number of E-7s as part of a multi-faceted approach to replacing the E-3s. ABMS is a highly ambitious effort that is still in the early stages of development and it could be important to seek at least an interim replacement in the near-term for at least some of the Sentries, too. Wedgetail in the Pacific: a Royal Australian Air Force E-7A at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in August 2019., U.S. Air National Guard/Master Sgt. C.T. Michael No matter what the exact plan might turn out to be for replacing the E-3s, it’s important to stress that any manned radar aircraft would likely be a primary target in a future near-peer conflict. Both China and Russia are developing very long-range air-to-air missiles, for example, which have been widely touted as “AWACS-killer” weapons. With that in mind, there have been suggestions that a constellation of small satellites in low Earth orbit, for example, could provide a much more resilient means of generating AEW&C coverage. There are meanwhile also a range of options to increase the survivability of an asset of this kind, ranging from hard-kill anti-missile interceptors to directed energy weapons and even missile-toting loyal wingman drones . In fact, Boeing sees the RAAF’s E-7s working as command and control for loyal wingman drones, but could also be extended to provide the same function for more advanced semi-autonomous UCAVs. Clearly, funds permitting, a rapid purchase of E-7s could furnish the Air Force with an all-new AEW&C at relatively short order, and Boeing would no doubt be receptive to further orders that would extend the Wedgetail production line beyond the three aircraft (reduced from five) for the United Kingdom. While the E-7 would seem to provide a ready-made solution for what General Wilsbach seems to have identified as a growing “AWACS gap” in the Indo-Pacific, in particular, we are still none the wiser as to the path the Air Force will adopt when it comes to finally replacing its veteran E-3 Sentry fleet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 2, 2021",It’s Official: Canada’s CF-18 Hornet Fighters Are Set To Get New Advanced Radars,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Raytheon has secured a deal worth approximately $140.3 million to supply AN/APG-79(V)4 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars to the Royal Canadian Air Force. This radar is one of, if not the most important component of a badly needed upgrade package that at least some of Canada’s CF-18A/B+ Hornet fighter jets are set to receive in the coming years. Details about this Hornet Extension Program, which you can read more about here , first emerged publicly last year. Raytheon’s Intelligence and Space division announced it had received the contract for an unspecified number of radars on Sept. 23, 2021. The U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is overseeing the purchase of the radars for Canada through the U.S. government’s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. This arrangement makes good sense from a contracting perspective, as well as with regard to economies of scale, since NAVAIR is already buying AN/APG-79(V)4s as part of a separate upgrade program for a portion of the U.S. Marine Corps’ legacy F/A-18A-D Hornet fleet . The (V)4 version of this radar is a scaled-down and enhanced derivative of the AN/APG-79(V)1 found on F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets. An RCAF CF-18A+ Hornet fighter jet., RCAF “Having the right tool for the job matters, and we’re committed to delivering just that for the Royal Canadian Air Force,” Eric Ditmars, Vice President of Secure Sensor Solutions at Raytheon Intelligence and Space, said in a statement. “This upgrade to AESA [active electronically scanned array] radars with GaN [Gallium Nitride] supports longer detection ranges and multiple-target tracking.” At present, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) has around 75 CF-18A/B+ jets. In addition, it is slowly incorporating a number of additional ex-Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18A/B Hornets into that force, with 18 of those jets eventually expected to enter Canadian service . AESAs, in general , can detect and track targets at greater ranges, and do so faster and more accurately than older, comparably sized mechanically-scanned designs. GaN technology, which you can read more about here , only helps an AESA radar be more efficient and precise, increasing its ability to discriminate between targets — even smaller, harder to detect ones such as low-flying cruise missiles — and track more of them at once. The increased power also helps improve its resistance to electronic warfare jamming and increases the radar’s range. The new AESAs are a critical update for Canada’s CF-18A/B+ fighters, which are presently equipped with mechanically scanned AN/APG-73 radars that they received as part of a previous upgrade program. The new AN/APG-79s will improve the ability of these aircraft to support the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a key mission for the RCAF’s Hornet fleet. NORAD oversees the defense of the airspace over both countries. RCAF CF-18A/B+s have also participated on multiple occasions in NATO’s rotational air policing missions over Iceland and the Baltic Sea region , as well as air-defense missions emanating from Greenland . In the air-to-air role, AESA radars on Canada’s Hornets could also open up a path to improved weaponry. Back in 2017, the U.S. government approved the sale of AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs), which have a greater range compared to earlier AIM-120C variants, among other improvements you can read about in detail here . At that time, The War Zone highlighted the fact that the AIM-120D outranged the AN/APG-73 radars on Canada’s CF-18A/B+ jets, which would largely negate the capability boost that it might otherwise offer. An RCAF CF-18A+ Hornet fires an AIM-120C AMRAAM., RCAF The AN/APG-79 also has air-to-ground functionality, which could be useful for Canadian Hornets should they find themselves conducting airstrikes in the future. Canada’s CF-18A/B+s most recently conducted these kinds of combat sorties when the country took part in U.S.-led coalition operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The AN/APG-79(V)4 is also a very cost-effective option for RCAF, given that it is already in production and a process has already been developed for integrating it onto the U.S. Marine Corps’ very similar F/A-18A-D Hornets. In addition, “the APG-79(V)4 uses solid-state electronic technology with no moving parts, which equates to lower maintenance and repair costs, and increased aircraft availability,” according to Raytheon. An AN/APG-79(V)4 radar being fitted to a US Marine Corps F/A-18A-D Hornet., Raytheon These radars, as well as the associated cost considerations, and the rest of the planned Hornet Extension Program upgrades, are all extremely important for the future of the RCAF. The Canadian government currently expects to choose the winner of a competition to procure 88 new fighter jets in 2022. Lockheed Martin’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighter , Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , and Saab’s Gripen E are currently competing for that contract. This procurement program, which began after the country’s current Liberal Party canceled earlier plans to purchase F-35As after coming to power in elections in 2015, has been an absolute saga that you can read about more here . The collapse of an initial plan to acquire F/A-18E/F Super Hornets as an interim solution led to the deal to buy ex-Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18A/B aircraft. That purchase has since been roundly criticized as a poor investment since Canada now has to pay to bring those older, second-hand jets up to its own standards . At the same time, Canada has been a partner in the F-35 program since 1997, and technically still is, meaning it contributes tens of millions of dollars each year to support the continued development of that aircraft whether it ultimately buys any or not. You can read more about this obtuse arrangement here . All of this only puts greater emphasis on the need to ensure that the RCAF’s existing Hornet fleet, including the ex-Australian examples, remains operationally relevant for years to come. Under the Canadian government’s current fighter acquisition schedule, which is hardly set in stone, the last legacy Hornets wouldn’t leave service until 2032. At the same time, the full scope of the Hornet Extension Program is not entirely unclear. When the U.S. government approved the sale of the AN/APG-79(V)4 radars and other parts of the upgrade package last year, the expected deal included only 38 radars total. This was not enough to refit Canada’s entire Hornet fleet, even without the ex-Australian jets. Of course, even having a single AESA-equipped jet in a flight of CF-18A/B+ jets could provide benefits to the entire group, with information being shared with the other aircraft via datalinks. So, a formal contract to begin adding AESA radars to the RCAF’s Hornets is an important step forward in giving those aircraft a capability boost they desperately need. However, it remains to be seen just how many jets ultimately receive these new radars, or any other upgrades under the Hornet Extension Program, as Canada continues to meander through its attempts to recapitalize the country’s fighter jet force.

Brian O'Rourke,"Updated on Oct 13, 2021",The Army Acquired Its Own Hovercraft In The 1980s. It Didn’t Go Well.,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An old joke says that foreign militaries find the U.S. armed services baffling, in part because the U.S. Navy has its own air force and its own army—and the Navy’s army (the Marine Corps) has its own air force. Not to be outdone, the U.S. Army has its own navy . Since at least World War II, the Army has maintained a fleet of boats and ships (numbering more than 100,000 vessels in 1945), ranging from small landing craft to fairly large logistics support vessels . It has dozens of larger vessels and hundreds of small boats today. From 1983 to 1994, the Army even operated more than two dozen hovercraft. The LACV-30 (lighter, air cushion vehicle, 30-ton payload) was adapted in the 1970s from a commercial hovercraft built by Bell Aerospace Canada, the Bell Voyageur. Some 40 feet wide and 80 feet long, it had an empty weight of around 65,000 pounds, according to globalsecurity.org . The hovercraft ‘lighter’ — a name given to flat-bottomed craft that moves people and cargo from moored ships — was powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney PT6T Twin-Pac gas turbines running on standard JP4 jet fuel. The craft could carry up to 30 tons of payload, including two 20-foot containers, pallets, and small vehicles — though, unlike the actual Navy’s landing craft, air cushion (LCAC) , it could not handle a main battle tank such as the 60-ton-plus M1A1 , or even the 50-some-ton M60s that were still in service as late as 1991. The civilian Bell Voyageur, on which the LACV-30 was based., Bell Aerospace A U.S. Army LACV-30 hovercraft beached during Exercise Gallant Eagle 86, a joint exercise in July 1986 held at Twentynine Palms and Camp Pendleton, California., National Archives What the LACV-30 lacked in capacity it made up for in speed. Sources vary, but most put the cruise speed at between 50 and 60 mph, or 44 to 52 knots, while burning 260 gallons/hour. It had little in the way of self-defense capability, and its relatively small air cushion left it vulnerable to rough seas, limiting it to operations in sea state three — that is, in chop with waves heights of around three to four feet. On the other hand, its relatively small size and aluminum structure allowed it to be broken down for transport and reassembled when it reached its operating area. Unfortunately, the program never really gained any momentum, despite spending around $140 million (in 1986 dollars) to acquire 26 of them. Bell Aerospace Canada’s Voyageur design underlies the LACV-30. By contrast, the JEFF A/B, which grew into the U.S. Navy’s landing craft, air cushion/LCAC design, was a U.S. Bell project run out of its operation in New Orleans, Louisiana. The two craft were developed more or less in parallel, but with little apparent cooperation between the Bell divisions. According to a 1977 report from the then-General Accounting Office (GAO), LACV-30 operational testing was a bit of a mess. Instead of handing prototypes (based on the civilian Bell Voyageur craft) over to the Army’s operational testing and evaluation unit—the Armor and Engineer board—a subordinate unit of the Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), managed the process. It seems the Armor and Engineer Board team made a hash of the testing. According to the GAO report, the Army decided not to test the LACV-30 in the sort of conditions that might have made it useful: For example, Army officials said operational testing will not include tests of the vehicle’s capability to operate in plunging surf up to 8 feet high in winds up to 50 miles per hour in temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or over vertical obstacles up to 3 feet high. GAO A LACV-30 in action in 1986., US National Archives In fairness, it’s worth noting that TRADOC said it expected the missing tests would be done during developmental testing, once initial units had been procured, and that, anyway, there was plenty of such data from the civilian version. But, as the GAO added: “It is doubtful that civilian experience with a version of the LACV-30 was obtained under the types of conditions encountered during military amphibious operations. Similarly, the skills of civilian operators and maintenance personnel may not have been comparable to those of their military counterparts.” The Army eventually acknowledged that even its inadequate initial testing raised serious doubts about the vessels’ capability. Globalsecurity.org says the Army admitted “the LACV-30’s reliability, availability, and maintainability characteristics were inadequate” and it was likely unable to complete its designed two-hour shift “without a system or mission failure.” Despite these problems, the Army stood up two operational units, the 8th and 331st Transportation Companies. According to a history of the 8th , training began at Fort Story (today, part of Joint Base Little Creek, Virginia) in 1983, before the 8th was activated as an air cushion transportation company in October 1984. The unit had been variously a ground transport, helicopter, and boat company off and on since World War II. Cranes aboard the vehicle cargo ship USNS Altair (T-AKR 291) lower equipment to a LACV-30 lighter, air cushion vehicle, during Exercise Gallant Eagle 86., National Archives The company’s LACV-30s participated in exercises throughout the late 1980s, even working with the 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Camp Lejeune in June 1988, training for hostage rescue missions. But the maintenance issues with the lighters, combined with their operational limitations, ultimately were too, uh, deflating, and the Army pulled the plug on the 8th and 331st, as well as the LACV-30, all of which were decommissioned in 1994. The vehicles were sold to a company in Alaska, but environmental concerns — especially noise — ultimately made them impractical there. At least one decrepit example wound up for sale in Louisiana in recent years. A broken-down LACV-30 was offered for sale on the internet a few years ago., Louisianasportsman.com It’s probably no wonder, then, that when the Navy was looking for a hovercraft to call its own in the mid-1980s, it evaluated and then quickly discarded the LACV-30 in favor of Bell Textron’s much more capable LCAC . Part of the issue is that the Army couldn’t decide whether its hovercraft would be a true lighter (usually an unpowered barge) or a landing craft (a seagoing small transport) that can land on a contested beach. Both are used to move people and cargo from larger vessels, but seakeeping, speed, and — sometimes — self-defenses differentiate them. The LACV-30 compromised in too many ways, while the LCAC was designed with seakeeping and heavy lift in mind from the outset. Today, even as the LCAC is being phased out, its latest evolution, Bell’s Ship-to-Shore Connector LCAC 100, has begun to join the fleet. Hovercraft continue to have their uses, but a poorly performing one that depends on nearly ideal conditions could be considered evidence by those who contend that it’s not always best to let an army have its own navy.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 16, 2021",Stealthy F-117 Nighthawks Have Been Masquerading As Cruise Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of the Air National Guard, Air Force Lieutenant General Michael Loh, says that F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jets have been supporting training exercises, in part, by serving as surrogates for incoming cruise missiles. The Air Force only publicly acknowledged that some of the remaining fleet of F-117s, which were officially retired in 2008, were being used for any kind of training for the first time earlier this month , despite clear evidence that this has been the case for some time now . The War Zone was first to report on this latest deployment of Nighthawks to Fresno-Yosemite International Airport in California for dissimilar air combat training with F-15C/D Eagles from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing. Lieutenant General Loh offered this new detail about the F-117’s new lease on life in response to a question from one of Aviation Week ‘s reporters during the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, which concluded yesterday. The War Zone ‘s own Tyler Rogoway has highlighted repeatedly how the remaining flyable F-117s would be useful cruise missile surrogates since it first became apparent many years ago that at least some of the Nighthawks have been enjoying a very active “retirement.” An F-117, with its drag chute deployed, after landing at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport on Sept. 13, 2021., USAF “When you look at 117s that come and land and do that stuff, they’re a stealth platform, right?” Loh said. “Early days of stealth, but they’re still a stealthy platform.” “So they can simulate things out there like cruise missiles that we would actually face,” he continued. “So are they a perfect platform for a cruise missile defense exercise? Absolutely.” Broadly, cruise missiles — especially newer designs being developed and fielded by America’s potential near-peer adversaries, China and Russia — present significant threats to American forces abroad, as well as to the U.S. homeland and outlying American territories . U.S. military officials have been increasingly sounding the alarm about the possibility of land-attack cruise missile strikes on the United States , including weapons that could be launched from submarines lurking offshore . In addition, there has long been a fear that hostile parties, including non-state actors, might be able to carry out similar attacks from other types of vessels, including innocuous cargo ships, using purpose-built containerized systems or improvised ones. New and improved anti-ship cruise missiles, some of which have very small radar and infrared signatures, are also of particular concern to the U.S. Navy. https://youtube.com/watch?v=vPu_RL7Ncao https://youtube.com/watch?v=mbUU_9bOcnM Cruise missiles, in general, typically fly very low amongst the ground and surface clutter and are relatively small, inherently giving them small radar cross-sections and infrared signatures. This, in turn, means they can be very difficult to detect and then engage. Many modern threat cruise missiles, such as Russia’s air-launched Kh-101 , and its nuclear-armed Kh-102 variant, also have stealthy features of their own, which only makes them harder to spot and track. Russian and Chinese efforts to develop new designs capable of flying at hypersonic speeds only add more complexity to this overall threat picture. https://youtube.com/watch?v=8Os85izfcAo Lower-end cruise missiles can still be very real threats , too. Anti-ship and land-attack designs of various types are steadily proliferating around the world, including among smaller military forces and even non-state actors . All told, it would make perfect sense that F-117s have been flying, at least in part, as mock cruise missiles during training engagements with Air Force units, as well as other elements of the U.S. military. Nighthawks could also be useful stand-ins for cruise missiles to support the research and development and test and evaluation of new weapons, sensors, and other systems . The Air National Guard, in particular, is a key line of defense against potential cruise missile strikes on the homeland, and the Air Force has been looking to expand the capabilities of its F-15C/Ds , as well as its F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, to respond to these threats. The Eagles, such as the ones assigned to 144th Fighter Wing that trained with the F-117s earlier this month, have benefited from the addition of new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars that are better able to spot and track threats with smaller radar cross-sections, as well as Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods , which give the jets an alternative means of visually identifying targets, even at night, at extended ranges. The Sniper pod can be slaved to the aircraft’s radar, and vice versa, allowing the sensors to be used in a directly complementary way to rapidly detect, identify, and track potential threats. The addition of AESA radars to many of the service’s F-15C/Ds was largely spurred by the cruise missile threat. Now, some of the USAF’s F-16s, especially those belonging to guard units that watch over high-threat areas, like Washington, D.C., are also now getting AESA radars , as well as new tactics and weapons to deal with the cruise missile threat. Two F-15C Eagles from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing fly in formation with an F-117 Nighthawk, at right, during training in September 2021., USAF With Loh’s new comments about how the F-117s have been being employed, it only seems more likely that the Nighthawks have been acting in this role during their engagements with other services, as well. Some of the jets were notably spotted taking part in a Composite Unit Training Exercise ( COMPUTEX ) centered on the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group (CSG) off the coast of southern California last year, where the jets could very well have acted as mock anti-ship cruise missiles, among other roles. Non-stealthy aggressors are often used in exactly the same way to support naval training exercises. F-117s have also been spotted flying very low, which could reflect a mock cruise missile flight profile, during Air Force Red Flag exercises and while working with elements of that service’s prestigious Weapons School. The Weapons school is located at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, which is also the main hub for Red Flag drills. Of course, playing the role of cruise missiles is only one of the F-117’s jobs today. As Lieutenant General Loh noted, despite the age of their stealth technology, these jets are still stealthy and are unlike anything most Air Force pilots or any personnel they are working with at sea or on the ground down below are likely to have encountered in any other context. This all means the Nighthawk, which celebrated the 40th anniversary of its first flight this year, remains a very valuable asset for all kinds of dissimilar aerial combat training, as well as various test purposes. “Although officially retired, many F-117s remain airworthy and are used to support limited research and training missions based on overall cost-effectiveness and their ability to offer unique capabilities,” an official Air Force news item about the Nighthawks training with the 144th Fight Wing also noted. The Air Force still has dozens of these jets in storage at the Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada, the F-117’s first operational home and where the aircraft still flying today are based, which can serve as a key source of spare parts. That the Nighthawks are seen as relatively low-cost for the capabilities they offer is also a testament to its original design, which leveraged components from various existing U.S. military combat jets. With the Air Force now clearly opening up more and more to talking about what its remaining F-117s are still up today, we may now start to get even more details about exactly how these jets are being utilized nearly a decade and a half after they were officially retired. In their role as cruise missile surrogates, we could also soon see them show up to train with all four of the Air National Guard units equipped with F-15C/D fighters that are tasked with protecting America’s maritime borders, as well as the F-16s whose mission is to guard the highly sensitive airspace over the nation’s capital in Washington, D.C.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With the long, long-awaited Top Gun 2 movie delayed yet again, naval aviation fans can probably be excused for feeling at least some symptoms of fast-jet withdrawal. It’s good news, then, that the latest cruise video from the U.S. Navy’s Strike Fighter Squadron 154 , or VFA-154, also known as the “Black Knights,” has just dropped. And the real-life result, running to a full 30 minutes in high definition, is well worth your time. In fact, it’s the best Super Hornet footage we have ever seen. The video, which you can watch in full below, was shot during VFA-154’s 2020-21 cruise to the Western Pacific on board the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) with its F/A-18F Super Hornets . Navy Lieutenant Taylor “Gary the Snail” Barrett and other members of the squadron — which has the rallying cry “Black Knights Rule!” or BKR — put it together using a combination of gimbal-mounted cameras, GoPros, and cell phones. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO8QSTmdwCc That carrier’s back-to-back overseas deployments , which were completed in May this year, did not involve combat missions but were not without incident, extending ultimately across 16 months. The vessel spent months in port in Guam last year following a serious COVID-19 outbreak among its crew that devolved into a major political scandal that ultimately led to the resignation of then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly. There was also the crash of an F/A-18F from the Theodore Roosevelt into the Philippine Sea in June 2020, which we reported on at the time. Both crew members were, fortunately, able to eject safely. Naval aviation rarely looked so darn fun as in the latest “Black Knights” cruise video., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The tone of the video, however, is in keeping with the high spirits of a squadron on a high after an otherwise successful cruise, which included two separate periods operating in the South China Sea, including sailing alongside its sister ship , USS Nimitz (CVN-68), apparently to send a message to China, which had been increasingly flexing its military muscles in this hotly disputed region . The result is no-holds-barred access to the daily routines of a deployed squadron, starting with getting kitted-up, the ever-dramatic cat shots (set here to the sounds of Mötley Crüe), all the way through to live weapons drops on the training range, dogfights over the Pacific with Hawaii-based U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptors and Indian Su-30MKI Flankers , and the downtime in the squadron’s ready room.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is now actively looking into the possibility of buying a fleet of E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft. The service’s top uniformed officer says that these aircraft could provide a “path” from the retirement of the aging fleet of E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System jets, or AWACSs, and a future space-based radar capability. Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown, as well as Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall and General Mark Kelly, head of Air Combat Command (ACC), all made comments this week about the potential value of acquiring E-7s at the Air Force Association’s (AFA) annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, which ended yesterday. General Kenneth Wilsbach, the commander of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), had been the first to publicly issue a call for the service to buy Wedgetails back in February, which we covered in detail . General Jeffrey Harrigian, head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), has since offered his support for the idea, as well. A U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. , USAF “We are doing internal analysis,” General Brown told reporters on Tuesday . “The E-7 is a good platform.” “It could be useful to the Air Force,” Secretary Kendall said on Monday . Brown also pointed out that the Wedgetail is in service already with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and that the U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) is now in line to buy five of these jets to replace its own E-3s. South Korea and Turkey are also operators of this aircraft. Boeing first developed the plane, which is based on the 737 Next Generation airliner airframe, specifically for Australia in the 1990s. The Air Force’s E-3 Sentries, which carry a large radar in a circular radome on top of the rear fuselage, are extremely important supporting assets for U.S. air combat operations. They providing the ability to detect and track multiple threats, as well as just generally monitor specific areas of the aerial battlespace. They can also help track targets at sea. With that information in hand, they also serve as critical command and control and battle management platforms, forwarding data to other assets in the air and down below. The more modern E-7 has the same general role and is immediately recognizable by the large Northrop Grumman Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar, which has air and sea-search modes, on top of the rear end of the fuselage. The Wedgetail also has extensive communications and data-sharing capabilities to ensure it can pass on relevant information to other friendly assets in the air, as well as at sea and on the ground. Based on the most popular commercial airliner design ever and a twin-engine airframe that is still in production and smaller than the E-3, the E-7 is more fuel-efficient and cheaper to operate and maintain. A certain degree of commonality with other aircraft currently in U.S. military service based on other 737 variants, such as the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane and the C-40 Clipper passenger transport, could further ease sustainment costs. All of this is particularly important given that the existing Sentries are based on the long out-of-production Boeing 707 airliner and are only becoming more difficult to keep flying. “They’ve served our nation well. They’re serving our nation right now,” General Kelly also said at the AFA gathering on Monday. “[But] there’s a reason why exactly zero airlines on the globe fly the 707. Because it takes miracle workers every day to just get it up in the air.” “Unlike our closest treaty allies, we do not field a cutting-edge, air-moving target indicator capability,” he added. “We don’t.” Chief of Staff Brown, who had initially expressed some reticence about buying E-7s earlier this year, makes clear the service now sees the Wedgetail as “an option to be able to get the capability much faster than if we were to start a new start from scratch.” At the same time, however, he said that any purchase of these planes would “gives us a path” to what the service apparently really desires: a new space-based radar capability, which the General suggested could be less vulnerable than a system based on a commercial airliner. “When you look to the future, ideally you’d like to be able to look at capability that can be defensible,” he explained. Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown speaks at the 2021 Air Force Association Air, Space, and Cyber Conference., USAF It is important to note that potential U.S. adversaries, especially Russia and China, have already fielded various counter-space capabilities, at least to some degree, and are in the process of developing new and improved anti-satellite weapons . These threats are aimed in no small part at challenging historical American superiority in a host of space-based capabilities, including early warning , intelligence-gathering , navigation and weapons guidance , and communications and data-sharing. The U.S. military has itself been exploring possibilities for future distributed space-based networks that are more resilient and less vulnerable , as well as ways to rapidly replace any satellites that are destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable. It’s also not clear what the state of the development of the space-based radar capability General Brown is envisioning might be at present. In May, Space Force General Jay Raymond, that service’s top officer, did disclose the existence of a highly classified program to develop a constellation of radar satellites. However, these will be focused on providing ground moving-target indicator (GMTI) functionality as part of separate plans to replace the Air Force’s E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battlefield surveillance and management aircraft with a distributed network of capabilities. It is still very possible that the U.S. military already has in some stage of development other radar-equipped satellites intended to provide capabilities similar to E-3 and E-7-type aircraft in the classified realm. Multiple countries, as well as private companies , already publicly operate various space-based radars, but primarily for imaging purposes . In the meantime, the E-7 certainly presents a proven platform that could be readily acquired relatively quickly to supplant the Air Force’s aging E-3s and provide critical airborne early warning and control capabilities in the near term.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just a couple of days ago, The War Zone reported on a video showing an RC-135U Combat Sent spy aircraft making an extremely hard landing in a crosswind at RAF Mildenhall in England. At the time we posited that one of the aircraft’s engines might have struck the ground, which was also confirmed as the likely outcome by a veteran RC-135 pilot. Shortly after we published our report, an image supposedly showing one of the jet’s CFM56 engine nacelles with a big gash in it emerged. Now we have new images, taken on September 17th, 10 days after the incident, that show the aircraft in question equipped with an engine nacelle panel from a KC-135R tanker. This color-mismatched panel is located in the same place where the gash was seen in the image that was supposedly taken following the incident. The images come to us from Andrew McKelvey who was able to snap the pics of the Combat Sent, one of only two in existence, as it headed out to Souda Bay, Greece.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 27, 2025",Listen To An F-16’s Intercept Of An Army Cessna That Violated Airspace Near The United Nations (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It got very lively in the skies over New York City today when a wayward Cessna belonging to the U.S. Army strayed into restricted airspace around New York City that was in place to protect the annual U.N. General Assembly, at which President Biden was in attendance. The light aircraft was intercepted by F-16C Vipers from the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard—the famous Red Tails—that were on temporary duty providing air patrols for the high-profile event. The homeland air defense mission , in general, falls under the purview of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). We now have very rare audio of radio communications between air traffic control and the Vipers, which usually communicate on UHF so they are not recorded on standard VHF frequencies, trying to find the aircraft, intercepting it, and then the Cessna pilot’s response. As you can hear below, the action began around 2:00 PM local time. One of the F-16s checks in with New York Approach using the callsign NOBLE 12 and asked for vectors to the TOI, or Track Of Interest. The fighter pilot had trouble finding the Cessna on radar, which is not surprising for a low-flying small aircraft operating around a metropolis like New York City. From there the intercept unfolds. You can feel how complex and tight the airspace by the exchanges. Original audio is via the awesome LiveATC.net: It’s worth noting that having constant air patrols overhead these types of high-security temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) is common. The fighters do so with the support of tankers. Often times units from around the United States will deploy to a particular region to help provide around-the-clock coverage for these events, which is a very consuming affair. From images and video of the intercept, as well as from the audio, we know that one of the F-16s flew above the Cessna and dropped its gear, in order to indicate that it needed to land ASAP.

Temporary Flight Restriction area violations such as this one occur from time to time and are a normal part of NORAD operations — North American Aerospace Defense Command (@NORADCommand) September 21, 2021 At the end of the recording, you can hear the pilot communicating with air traffic control, which informs him an F-15—a mistake, it was an F-16—was above him. He then gets clearance to land and to call the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at a certain number once he is down, as is customary when these incidents occur. The F-16, NOBLE 12, eventually returns to his CAP (Combat Air Patrol) point, after some frustration in getting cleared to do so. The homeland air sovereignty mission is performed by specially trained crews that work closely with various air defense sectors . Special communications, rules of engagement, intercept procedures, and even equipment are used to accomplish the high-stakes mission. You can read all about how they execute these intercepts in this past piece of ours. As for the restricted airspace violating Cessna 182, it is one of just two that belong to the U.S. Army. In fact, they are the only single-engine piston manned aircraft in the Army’s inventory. They serve West Point as part of an interesting program that AOPA provides a nice summary of here: Today, most officers who graduate from West Point and become military aviators go on to fly helicopters; only a few will go on to fly fixed-wing aircraft. Many of them gained their passion for aviation as cadets through participation in one of West Point’s not-so-well-known general aviation activities. About 30 minutes to the northwest of West Point, “over the mountain,” lies New York Stewart International Airport (SWF). Stewart is a dual-use military and civilian airfield and is home to the 2nd Aviation Detachment, the “Wings of West Point.” In their hangar, across from two UH–72 Lakota helicopters, you will find the Army’s only single-engine piston fixed-wing aircraft. The two Cessna 182s are operated by the Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering. These Skylanes are used to support the academic flight program, which is part of the aeronautical engineering minor in the mechanical engineering major. The cadets in the program take an in depth look at the engineering aspect of flight, how the aircraft works, and why. Cadets develop hypotheses, make test plans, and take measurements in flight. Image of one of the Army’s West Point Skylanes., US ARMY West Point’s best-kept aviation secret is the West Point Aviation Club (WPAC). Many of the cadets and faculty involved in the academic program also devote time to WPAC. “The mission of WPAC is to provide leader and military skill development opportunities to cadets interested in Army Aviation as well as achieve consistent success at regional and national collegiate flying team competitions,” its charter says. The West Point Aviation club also operates a well-maintained Piper PA–28-140 Cherokee and rents other Cherokees or an Archer for flight training and competition practice. The club is led by Army and Air Force officers with a range of aviation backgrounds in both military and civil aviation. In addition to providing cadets with leadership opportunities and exposure to the general aviation community, the team competes against other colleges and service academies in the region under the National Intercollegiate Flying Association (NIFA). These competitions reinforce a safety culture, maintain the knowledge required to be a successful pilot, and hone vital flying skills. The team competes in two events per year: a regional NIFA competition in the fall, and an invitational event in the spring with the Naval and Coast Guard academy teams. The person flying the Army Cessna was actually an instructor pilot, according to Davis Winkie of Military Times , who writes : West Point spokesperson Lt. Col. Beth Smith acknowledged that the Army pilot “briefly violated” the flight restrictions. “A West Point fixed wing aircraft flown by an Army instructor pilot conducting a cadet flight lab in support of ME481, a Civil and Mechanical Engineering class, briefly violated temporarily restricted airspace this afternoon near the George Washington Bridge,” Smith told Military Times. “Once they realized they had violated the airspace, they immediately left the area and returned to the airport.” So there you have it, some very rare audio of a real-life intercept at probably the highest-profile VIP event of the year. Thankfully, in this case, it was just an Army aviator who likely hadn’t checked the notices to airmen (NOTAMs) in the area where he was flying that day. But it is a good reminder of what is up there waiting to move in at a moment’s notice during these types of high-profile events, just in case. Author’s note: A huge thanks to our friend @thenewarea51 for their help in preparing this article. UPDATE: Someone had also recorded the UHF conversations between the F-16 pilots, as well as Huntress (NORAD), before, during, and after the intercept.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Augmented Reality Dogfight Training For Fighter Pilots Has Made A Major Leap In Capability,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Red 6, a company that aims to completely upend how America’s tactical aircraft communities conduct air-to-air combat training through the use of augmented reality, or AR, has made new progress in the development of the software and hardware that make up its novel system. The firm recently demonstrated the ability to conduct training sorties that pit a real pilot against multiple simulated adversaries, as well as work with a friendly virtual wingman to engage a single mock threat, rather than just one-on-one engagements . The pilot “sees” these other synthetic “aircraft” through an AR headset, the design of which continues to become more capable, but also smaller, and is now able to fit entirely under the visor of a fighter pilot’s helmet. Dan Robinson, the founder and CEO of Red 6, who is also a former U.K. Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot and the first non-American to get behind the stick of an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter , shared details about these achievements and talked about where his company is looking to take its work in the future with The War Zone on the sidelines of the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference yesterday. You can read more about Red 6’s history and its vision in this past War Zone feature interview with Robinson. Red 6 has already made important strides in the development of its technology in recent years. In August, the company announced that the Air Force had awarded it a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, worth up to $70 million over the next five years, to continue work on “commercialization” of its artificial intelligence (AI) driven Airborne Tactical Augmented Reality System (ATARS). A pilot being able to use ATARS to interact with multiple simulated aircraft at once is an important step forward in that direction. While it is certainly impressive for a human being wearing the headset to be able to square off against a single mock opponent in this hybrid real-world/virtual training environment, a capability the company first demonstrated last year, it is hardly representative of what actual aerial combat would look like. This would be especially true with regard to training meant to simulate higher-end air operations against a potential peer adversary, such as China . Red 6’s Robinson specifically highlighted how a potential major conflict with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would include a large number of hostile fighters, including advanced types such as the stealthy J-20 , as well as dense integrated air defenses and other threats. He also noted that his company is now able to add surface-to-air missiles into the AR training environment, in addition to enemy jets, further adding to the overall realism of the simulated threat picture. Beyond threats, Red 6’s system now also allows real pilots to work with simulated AI-driven wingmen in AR, allowing for two-on-one engagements with mock hostile aircraft. In the past, the company had said it was able to insert friendly aircraft, including tankers, into this synthetic training, but pilots were only able to conduct general flight maneuvers in relation to them. Red 6 plans to continue working to add more types of assets — in the air and on the surface — to its simulations as time goes on. As work on the software-based components of Red 6’s system has progressed, so has the development of the actual AR goggles that are key to the entire thing. Robinson told The War Zone the headset’s design is capable of displaying increasingly higher fidelity visuals and is otherwise becoming more powerful, while also becoming smaller and generally easier to manage. The latest iteration of the design is notably entirely self-cooled, whereas earlier versions had been connected to an external cooling system. This has helped to make it compact enough to go under the visor of a pilot’s helmet instead of a more clunky add-on peripheral. An older version of Red 6’s headset., USAF Red 6’s Robinson says his company’s ultimate goal is to provide an AR-enabled hybrid training environment that is so robust and comprehensive that the Air Force, or any other future customer, would never need to have a physical aircraft fly in a “red air” adversary role again. He described this vision as essentially being an extremely high-fidelity synthetic training capability similar to the one described in the novel Ender’s Game and depicted in the 2013 movie adaption, as seen in the clip below. The core issue that Robinson sees going forward when it comes to air-to-air combat training is an inability to scale up actual red air capacity to support scenarios that accurately represent high-end conflicts. He described a current reality in which there is a “chronic undersupply” of adversary capacity, but also a “massive demand signal” that military air arms such as the U.S. Air Force cannot reasonably expect to fill through a mix of their own organic manned and unmanned aircraft supplemented by contractor-operated jets . He noted that this would be especially true in the future, as the need to give pilots the opportunity to face advanced stealthy fifth-generation threats continues to grow. This is something The War Zone has touched on separately in the past . While Robinson acknowledged that ground-based simulators would continue to be an important part of the overall air-to-air combat training picture, he said those systems cannot fully recreate the “cognitive load” and other stresses that a pilot experiences when flying a real airplane. This, in turn, inherently limits how realistic the training they provide can be. In addition, the Red 6 founder and CEO pointed out that the company would provide a way for services such as the Air Force to get the very most out of what could be limited non-combat flying hours for individual pilots. An AR-enabled system could allow for even the most routine training sorties to include a large number of simulated aircraft, providing opportunities for more regular large force exercises without the costs and complexities required to get high numbers of real planes in the air together. Red 6’s founder and CEO Dan Robinson wearing an earlier version of his company’s AR headset., Red 6 At the same time, there have been some suggestions that an AR-enabled training environment might offer more capability than is actually necessary, especially given the expectation that many air-to-air engagements in the future will be fought at beyond visual range (BVR). Other companies are working to expand their abilities to simulate a variety of threats synthetically in real-world training, but without the kind of direct visual representation that Red 6’s AR system offers. Robinson countered by explaining that while future aerial combat will certainly involve a significant number of BVR engagements, the overall volume of aircraft in the battlespace, especially in a high-end conflict, means that visual-range engagements are inevitable. As a result, “we better know what we’re doing within visual range,” he said. It remains to be seen, of course, whether Red 6 can meet these ambitious goals. The recent contract award from the Air Force makes clear that there is substantial interest now in what the company is developing, which offers the potential for massive cost savings to the service over its current mix of air-to-air training capabilities. It could help free up fighters, especially advanced fifth-generation ones, and their pilots from having to spend valuable time acting as aggressors, too. Red 6’s AR technology could also have future applications beyond air-to-air training, as well. Earlier this year, a number of Air Force pilots had the opportunity to experience what the system has to offer, with the service specifically highlighting how it could be useful for B-1 bomber pilots to conduct aerial refueling training without any need for actual tankers, which are always in high demand . A member of the Red 6 team talks about the company’s AR headset with U.S. Air Force officers. , USAF There is the also potential for personnel in the air, as well as at sea and on the ground, to interact with simulated assets and each other in future exercises using this system. Right now, Red 6 is set to begin integrating its training system onto one of the Air Force’s T-38 Talon jet trainers as part of its SBIR contract, with future plans to install it onto an F-16 Viper fighter jet , as well. The company has been conducting its own flight testing using a modified piston-engine Berkut aircraft. The Berkut ultralight aircraft that Red 6 has been using to flight test its AR system., USAF “We are excited to continue to grow our presence within the U.S. Air Force as we harness the power of our one-of-a-kind technology in support of the warfighter,” Robinson said in a press release regarding the contract award in August. “I couldn’t be more excited for our future warfighters, as the adoption of the Red 6 technology will dramatically improve the quality of training that they will receive. We owe it to them to continue to innovate so they remain the best trained and best-equipped warfighters in the world.” Red 6 has already been able to advance the state of its potentially game-changing technology relatively quickly in recent years. It will be very interesting to see where the company can take it now with substantial cooperation and financial backing from the Air Force.

This site, located in the Mojave Desert not far from the company’s Skunk Works headquarters at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, is among the most sophisticated of its kind and has played a key role in the development of U.S. stealth aircraft since the early 1980s. You can read all about this facility, which looks ripped from a science fiction movie, in this past feature of ours. While we don’t know what this shape is intended to resemble, it provides a timely reminder of some of the exotic test work that’s clearly going on behind closed doors, at facilities like Helendale and others, on a number of advanced combat jet development programs that we know about, as well as more stealthy aviation work going on in the classified realm. A short video showing the apparent test shape seems to have been first posted to the TikTok video-sharing social networking service, before being shared on other social media channels. Ruben Hofs brought it to our attention on Twitter. Hofs, who tweets as @rubenhofs , used an open-source intelligence (OSINT) comparison of buildings and foliage in the locale to determine that the video was almost certainly taken at Helendale. The video itself shows what looks like an inverted stealth aircraft shape being transported on a flatbed trailer, while a voice asks: “What the fuck is that?” As Hofs notes, the shape of the aircraft is very different from typical “pole caps,” which are more familiar test shapes used for calibration of the pylons used in RCS tests at Helendale and other facilities. Transporting the shape upside-down is also far from unusual for these kinds of tests, since surrogate airframes (and other test articles) are often mounted inverted on the test pylon at Helendale and other similar facilities before being exposed to electromagnetic emissions to measure their radar signature. Alongside many other test facilities, the RCS lab at Helendale occupies a large open area upon which models of aircraft and other test specimens can be mounted on poles, often either consisting of acute angles or made of a radar transparent substance. The test articles can then be exposed to emissions from various radar systems and from various aspects. This is, by its nature, a highly sensitive field of work, and security is typically tight. THE Lockheed Skunk Works RCS range at Helendale., GOOGLE EARTH The facility has underground areas into which test articles can be lowered when not in use, to hide them from prying eyes. Radar arrays, too, are mounted on hydraulic lifts so they can be raised or lowered, as well as slid into place, as required. Secure storage buildings on site also house test articles when not in use. A test article for the BAE Systems Replica fighter jet concept inverted on an RCS test stand: Intriguingly, the test shape does seem to show some broad similarities with various next-generation fighter designs, including some concepts for Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), that we have seen to date. It appears to have a diamond-like, tailless shape, with an elongated fuselage and a single prominent chine line. The ‘hump’ is perhaps where the cockpit would be located, although the shape could equally be intended to represent an unmanned concept. It is hard to tell if the article represents a full planform, or more of just the fuselage. While it’s by no means easy to gauge the size of the vehicle being tested, since this could be a scale model, the Air Force has expressed interest in a larger design , with increased carriage of internal fuel and weapons, although it should be remembered there are a variety of other ongoing programs beyond the Air Force’s NGAD, including the U.S. Navy’s version, also called NGAD . A notional next-generation design from the Air Force. , Air Force Research Lab A notional next-generation naval fighter design from Boeing., Boeing A next-generation fighter concept that has appeared in official Lockheed Martin releases in recent years. , Lockheed Martin It’s worth noting that the test model in question is unlikely to be some highly sensitive aspect of an ongoing program, above all since it was seen being moved around in daylight in plain view of contractors and facility workers. On the other hand, Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works has a long history of being right on the bleeding edge of stealth aircraft developments . Oftentimes, many shapes will be tested and evolved into an eventual settled-upon design. Whatever the case, getting the chance to see a never before seen RCS test model being used at Helendale is not an everyday occurrence, although, at any given time, the facility is likely to be testing a range of such articles, not only potential aircraft designs but also individual structures that make up manned aircraft and drone designs. Indeed, the facility itself is remarkably little known, considering the important work it has done and just how strange it looks. Meanwhile, we do know that Helendale has seen a significant expansion to its infrastructure to support work on classified projects. 20,000 additional square feet of “classified storage” at the site was completed in April 2021, according to information Lockheed Martin provided at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for its newest advanced production facility at Plant 42, which you can read more about here . The company could not say what projects, past or present, might make use of this additional storage space. We do know, however, that construction work completed at Helendale recently is part of a broader Lockheed Martin effort to expand its available facilities to develop and build advanced aerospace vehicles. RQ-3 Dark Star and F-22 being tested at Helendale. , Lockheed Martin Of course, it’s impossible to say whether there is any direct connection between this test shape and NGAD or other future combat aircraft programs, the appearance of this article on a trailer, apparently at a leading RCS research center, is certainly interesting and reinforces the fact that there are, without doubt, many more innovative shapes and future aircraft concepts being tested here and elsewhere.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Aug 20, 2021",Tucson Mystery Drone Had Rotors According To Border Patrol Helicopter Aircrew’s Emails,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A helicopter belonging to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, encountered what was described as a “ highly modified drone ” over Tucson, Arizona earlier this year on February 9 as it flew through controlled airspace near Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. A Tucson Police Department Air Support helicopter was called in to aid the CBP crew, at which point both aircraft pursued the remarkably wily drone as it easily evaded them and eventually outran them to the northwest. Dan Marries of KOLD in Tucson broke the initial story of the drone encounter after interviewing a special agent with the FBI, which announced an investigation the same day. The War Zone has since obtained the Tucson Police Department’s official report from the incident, as well as air traffic audio recorded during the encounter. Now, we have obtained an after-action internal email from CBP that shows the aircrew was able to identify the craft as a drone with quadcopter-like rotors. A CBP Airbus AS350 A-Star, similar to one of the helicopters involved in the Tucson drone encounter., CBP Our previous reporting found that the aircrews claimed the craft that they chased through the Tucson skies was “ not like any other ” unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) they had previously encountered. In particular, the speed, awareness, maneuverability, altitude performance, and endurance of the UAV made some readers wonder if, in fact, the craft pursued by the law enforcement helicopters was a drone at all. Thanks to a recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, we can now share an internal CBP email, which definitively states that the crew of its helicopter over Tucson during this incident encountered a “quadcopter-like” small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and was able to observe “propellers reflecting the city light” on the drone. CBP via FOIA After the two law enforcement helicopters began their pursuit, the CBP crew reported seeing the UAV hovering over Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, near the base’s heritage hangar in an apparent “GPS hover hold.” That hangar is in almost perfect alignment with the Runway 12 approach. DMAFB’s heritage hangar, center; Kinder Morgan fuel terminal, left; and DMAFB’s Runway 12, bottom right., Google Maps In the email, the author, whose identity is redacted, also writes that the quadcopter’s single green light was at the perfect wavelength to be filtered out by the CBP helo crew’s night vision goggles (NVGs), which explains why the Tucson Police Department’s (TPD) report notes that the drone was not visible through them: While departing KDMA via the [redacted] the crew of [redacted] had a near midair collision with a quadcopter like sUAS near Banner South Hospital at [redacted] MSL. The SAM observer BPA [redacted] was the first to see the sUAS pass across the nose within 30-50ft from right to left at the same altitude. During the pass the observer was able to note propellers in a configuration similar to a quadcopter like sUAS system. The pilot AIA [redacted] was talking to ATC as the sUAS passed and requested a 360 degree turn to track the sUAS. ATC approved the request, and the crew regained visual and tracked the sUAS towards KDMA. While enroute to KDMA the sUAS passed by the TEP Powerplant and also made a few orbits over the nearby fuel farm. Once the sUAS reached KDMA it started a loiter pattern on the north side of the base at an altitude between [redacted] MSL. The loiter pattern observed by the pilot appeared to be a GPS hover hold just northeast of the KDMA Heritage hanger [sic] located on the northwest corner of the airfield. The pilot maneuvered the Astar helicopter 50-75ft below the sUAS and was able to observe propellers reflecting the city light off of them. The pilot noted the sUAS to be a quadcopter like shape and approximately 3-5ft wide with a single green blinking green LED light on the bottom. The green LED light was the at [sic] a nanometer wavelength that was filtered out by the crew’s NVGs, so an unaided visual track was required. The cockpit of one of the TPD’s Air Support Bell 206B-3 Jet Ranger helicopters., TPD A lengthy, entirely redacted section follows the passage above. At the end of this redacted section, the email continues: At approximately [redacted] northwest of Marana Airport the sUAS climbed into the clouds and visual contact was lost by [redacted] in an area between Marana Airport and Silver Bell Mine. The crew of [redacted] descended to a lower altitude and conducted a search for a possible recovery crew within the area of the last visual sighting. The search area extended from [redacted] northwest of Marana Airport to just west of Silver Bell Mine. The crew of [redacted] searched for approximately thirty minutes and was unable to find any personnel or vehicles parked in the area. Due to this being a request for records related to the CBP Air and Marine Operations Helicopter under the registration N790AM, and given TPD’s records state that the CBP helicopter went by the callsign Troy 164, it’s safe to assume that some of these redactions could be “Troy 164.” Along with this email, the CBP released the aircrew’s TOMIS ( Tasking, Operations and Management Information System ) daily log, which is nearly entirely redacted. The War Zone is pursuing a further declassification review in an attempt to unredact at least some of this information.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin have provided new looks and additional insights into a recent full demonstration of the Rapid Dragon air-launched palletized munitions concept. On this occasion, surrogate weapons were delivered from the cargo holds of a C-17A Globemaster III airlifter and an EC-130J Super J, a psychological warfare platform based on the classic Hercules transport. The development reinforces the swift pace established by this program, which 10 months ago existed only in concept form and is managed by the Air Force’s Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE). Its implications could extend beyond the United States as well. The newly released video and photos show the results of the Rapid Dragon tests that took place over White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, in August of this year . The various demonstrations, according to Lockheed Martin, “covered all aspects of a palletized strike mission up to and including the release of surrogate cruise missiles,” proving out the basic feasibility of the concept. Rapid Dragon, which you can read about in detail here , is based around using existing airlifters as ‘weapons trucks.’ This, in turn, is intended to offer a way of boosting the amount of available standoff strike assets, an expedient that might prove beneficial if the United States were to find itself at war with China or Russia, for example. Outfitting cargo aircraft with a palletized standoff-weapons capability also promises to be far cheaper than fielding additional bombers, making this an even more attractive concept at a time when budgets are stretched. It is also scalable, so smaller or larger airlift assets could potentially employ it. At the same time, America’s finite fleet of airlifters would likely be pushed to its absolute maximum capacity during a peer-state conflict, making the actual viability of such a concept, at least when used in a sustained manner, somewhat debatable. Still, it would be a valuable option to have. Lockheed Martin In the August tests involving the airdrops of the Rapid Dragon munition pallet from a C-17 and an EC-130J(SJ), the stores were deployed “at an operationally relevant altitude,” according to Lockheed Martin, although no further details were given about how high the aircraft were flying when they released their payloads. Once released, and stabilized by parachutes, the munition pallet released surrogate missiles “in quick succession,” these being aerodynamically identical to the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range cruise missile, or JASSM-ER , which has a publicly stated range of at least 575 miles. “These Rapid Dragon deployments represent the first end-to-end demonstration of a palletized strike mission, from rolling missile pallets onto an aircraft to in-flight missile release,” said Scott Callaway, Lockheed Martin Advanced Strike Programs director, of the tests at White Sands. “They are a big step toward showing the feasibility of the palletized munitions concept and the ability of mobility aircraft to augment the strike capacity of tactical fighters and strategic bombers.” Lockheed Martin also provided further details about the targeting process used in the tests. In both the C-17 and EC-130 flights, personnel on the ground used beyond-line-of-sight communications (satellite communication datalinks) to transmit targeting data to the Rapid Dragon system, demonstrating the ability to retarget the missiles while the launch aircraft is airborne. Lockheed Martin From what the Air Force and Lockheed Martin have shown now of the Rapid Dragon system, we also clearly see that it is intended to be a modular, scalable concept, at least with regard to the JASSM-ER. The missiles are each loaded into their own individual “deployment box,” which has an open, metal-framed design and breaks in half to release the missile. They can be arrayed in rows or stacked one on top of each other on a pallet. In real-world testing, so far, we have seen four missiles loaded on a single pallet in a 2-by-2 array, but concept art and models have shown six and nine-missile loads, as well. An official Air Force model showing a Rapid Dragon pallet loaded with nine missiles. , Joseph Trevithick More tests are planned for the months to come and, while the August trials have been billed as an end-to-end test, the missiles deployed were surrogates. Before the end of this year, the next milestone should see an MC‑130J special operations transport drop a real, powered example of the JASSM-ER, to fully demonstrate the capabilities of this intriguing concept. While not being addressed officially at this time, there also is a potential export possibility that could be an even bigger game-changer for U.S. allies and partners. While none of them have bombers, they do have transport aircraft. With this concept being adaptable enough to even fit in a derivative of the M28 Skytruck , it could give these countries a powerful standoff strike platform option that would augment any limited fighter aircraft capacity they may have. The MC-145B Wily Coyote version of the M28 Skytruck is envisioned as being able to deploy JASSMs., Sierra Nevada Corporation In addition, the range an airlifter provides greatly increases the reach for such operations over fighter aircraft, unless aerial refueling is available, and even then their carriage capabilities are limited. Also, during major hostilities, any fighters in their inventories will be heavily tasked. As such, this capability makes a C-27J, C-130, or a C-17 a cruise missile carrier with minimal cost or modifications. Of course, the missiles still have to be purchased, but the JASSM is already in service with Poland, Finland, and Australia, all of which could see great value in the Rapid Dragon concept in the current geopolitical and strategic climate. More countries are likely to be added to the JASSM user list as well. It’s possible Rapid Dragon could be adapted for other missiles, as well, including those less advanced and tightly controlled than JASSM. One could imagine there would be a massive market for such a capability. There is also the possibility this could be used to launch small drones that can be recovered via parachute or conventional landing after their missions. Launching swarms in this fashion could be hugely beneficial, with a cruise missile-like modular drone that can be rapidly reconfigured to host warheads, sensors, communications, and other payloads. Regardless, after lots of talk about turning airlifters into arsenal ships and weapons trucks, it looks like a way to do just that with minimal modifications has arrived, and rapidly so, as the name suggests.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 3, 2021",Kratos’ New Airwolf Combat Drone Has Launched A Switchblade Loitering Munition In Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kratos has demonstrated the ability of its Airwolf unmanned aircraft to air-launch an AeroVironment Switchblade loitering munition, also commonly referred to as a “suicide drone.” This test has opened up a significant new “opportunity space” for how Airwolf, which is derived from its MQM-178 Firejet aerial target, could be employed operationally. The company has only given out relatively limited details about Airwolf, which is the smallest and cheapest of its publicly disclosed tactical designs , in the past and just released its first picture of one of these drones earlier this month. You can read more about what we had already been able to glean about this drone here . Steve Fendley, President of Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division, confirmed to The War Zone that the Switchblade test had occurred “a number of months ago,” on the sidelines of the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference yesterday. He also provided other details about Airwolf, which has also been referred to in the past as Tactical Firejet. Fendley said the company is currently “on contract” to provide Airwolfs for “different customers,” which he could not name, configured for surveillance and target acquisition mission sets, as well as what he described as “offensive support.” That latter category would seem to include the ability to launch Switchblades. https://youtube.com/watch?v=5KJZzgatjMg “It’s a very interesting capability,” Fendley said of the Switchblade test, specifically. “It’s a high-performance UAV [unmmanned aerial vehicle] launching another, what’s called a strike munition, which is a separate aircraft.” Airwolf, like the MQM-178 , is a relatively small, jet-powered drone that is launched from the ground via a catapult system. The two designs have the exact same outer mold line, according to Fendley, which means they both have an overall length of just under 11 feet and a wingspan of around six and a half feet. Airwolf obviously has different avionics and the ability to carry different payloads to perform tactical missions rather than act as a target like the MQM-178. Standard Firejets, which have a maximum takeoff weight of close to 320 pounds, are used to help train fighter pilots and ground-based air defense personnel, as well as support various research and development and test and evaluation activities. Firejet’s performance is “very much in the conventional subsonic fighter jet flight envelope” with its jet performance and the speed, and the ability to fly up to 35,000 feet,” Fendley added. “Obviously, it’s a bit lower performance, [and] doesn’t have the same endurance or payload capacity as our largest tactical system, the [XQ-58A] Valkryie .” A slide from a Kratos briefing showing the relative size of Airwolf, also referred to here as “Tac FJ,” for “Tactical Firejet,” compared to the XQ-58A, as well as the company’s other public designs., Kratos Switchblade is a very small, tube-launched unmanned system that was originally developed to be carried and employed by a single individual on the ground. It is a loitering munition, or suicide drone, a category of systems that blend together capabilities that are typically found on either unmanned aircraft configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions or missiles, but not both. The video below shows a multi-cell launch system AeroVironment developed for the Switchblade, underscoring how small a launcher for one of these loitering munitions can be. Switchblade can be used to scout ahead or conduct other kinds of short-duration surveillance missions using its combination of electro-optical and infrared cameras, but also has a small warhead, giving the operator the option to immediately strike any targets that it might come across. This loitering munition has certain autonomous capabilities, including the ability to automatically navigate to a designated target and follow it if moves, but it can also be employed in a manually-controlled mode. It can also be directed to strike a specific fixed area using GPS coordinates. You can read more about Switchblade’s capabilities in this past War Zone feature . No matter what, the operator remains in the loop throughout the course of a mission. This gives Switchblade a high degree of precision when used to strike a target, as the user, who “sees” what the drone sees through the feed from its cameras, can make minor course adjustments right up until the moment of impact. This also provides an additional margin of safety, since the person at the controls is monitoring the situation and can “wave off” the munition almost at the last moment should circumstances change, such as the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders in the target area. It’s not clear how the Airwolf was configured to launch the Switchblade. Artwork that Kratos, as well as its subsidiary 5-D Systems , has released in the past shows that Airwolf, like the MQM-178, can be configured to carry small stores under its wings. Switchblade is also small enough that its launcher could have been integrated into the Airwolf’s fuselage, as well. An artist’s conception of an Airwolf drone with stores under its wings., 5-D Systems Kratos’ Fendley did make clear that the Airwolf-launched Switchblade retained its operator-in-the-loop capability during the test. The feed from the suicide drone was relayed back to the user through a datalink on the Airwolf. That link also points to the potential use of this drone as a communications relay node, as well as its general ability to feed information to other assets, manned or unmanned, in the air or down below. All told, the pairing of Airwolf and Switchblade sounds like a very lethal combination. Fendley specifically highlighted how the Airwolf’s range, which he could only say was in the “many hundreds of nautical miles,” helps “extend the terminal utility range of that Switchblade by orders of magnitude.” Switchblade can only stay aloft for around 15 minutes and has a maximum range in its ground-launched configuration of just over six miles, which would be substantially increased when employed in an air-launched configuration. “It substantially obviously increases your stand-off position, which is ultimately the point for the unmanned systems anyway, keep the humans safe,” he added. “Nothing does it better than increasing your stand-off position by 10x.” Fendley pointed out that this isn’t the first time Kratos has demonstrated the ability of one of its drone designs to launch a smaller unmanned aircraft. In December 2020, the company, in cooperation with the Air Force, conducted a separate test that saw a stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie drone launch an Area-I ALTIUS 600 from a launcher in its internal payload bay. An XQ-58A Valkyrie releases an ALTIUS 600 drone using a launcher in its internal payload bay during a test in December 2020., USAF With regards to Airwolf, Kratos has separately demonstrated its ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy. That and other capabilities, combined with the low cost of each one of these tactical drones, makes the design “directly applicable to swarm missions” and “the manned-unmanned teaming realm,” Fendley said. Speaking “in general terms,” he said that Airwolf’s unit cost was under $500,000, though this price point would, of course, be dependent on the exact configuration of the drone. Even at $500,000, Airwolf is significantly cheaper than many stand-off air-to-ground munitions, as well as air-to-air missiles. Swarms are inherently ideal for overwhelming and otherwise disrupting enemy forces, especially air defense networks. A swarm of Airwolfs that then releases a large number of Switchblades over a target area would only add to this underlying capability. That same swarm could also include Airwolfs configured for general ISR or optimized for target acquisition, information that could then be used to target Switchblades. Some of the drones could also be configured to carry other payloads, such as electronic warfare jammers . When asked about whether any work was being done to adapt Airwolf into an air-launched configuration Fendley could only say “no comment.” He also could provide no additional information on separate testing of Kratos’ UTAP-22, also known as the Mako, a “loyal wingman” drone derived from the larger BQM-167 target drone , in an air-launched configuration. Being able to air-launch Airwolfs, potentially carrying Switchblades inside, from a larger manned or unmanned platform would only increase their ability to reach deeper into enemy territory or extend the time they would be able to loiter over a particular part of the battlespace. It would also bring totally new tactical opportunities to the launch platform. All told, the more we learn about Kratos’ Airwolf, which is currently the lowest, most affordable known tier of the company’s tactical offerings, the more intriguing the design becomes. The Switchblade test only underscores the already emerging versatility and flexibility of this relatively high-performance and low-cost platform.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 29, 2021",The Air Force Is Testing Robotic Loaders To Mount Hypersonic Missiles On Its Bombers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Picture the scene, a decade or so in the future. A close ally of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region has come under attack from a regional power, and the U.S. Air Force has deployed bombers to the area. These aircraft are stationed at established airfields but without the major infrastructure to support large-scale bomber operations, to reduce the chances of having these assets knocked out on the ground. After their arrival in theater, the bombers need arming, but with reduced ground crew and equipment on hand, it’s not going to be easy to rapidly load the aircraft with the huge hypersonic weapons that might have to be employed in retaliation. Enter the MHU-TSX, a robotic loading system that does that job more quickly, and almost autonomously, hauling these big weapons around and loading them on aircraft even at the kinds of austere airfields from which the Air Force is likely to fight future campaigns against peer or near-peer adversaries. Airmen from the 912th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron secure an AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon test round under the wing of a B-52H Stratofortress at Edwards Air Force Base, California., Air Force/Giancarlo Casem While hypersonic missiles are still some ways away from joining the Air Force’s arsenal, their development represents a major focus for the service—and one with potentially game-changing significance . For the most part, however, these weapons are seriously big, demanding different approaches to storing them, moving them, and ultimately loading (and unloading) them from aircraft. The AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon , or ARRW, for example, for which the B-52H Stratofortress is set to be the primary launch platform , is set to be carried on a new Boeing-developed underwing pylon, named Hercules, each of which will be able to hold three ARRWs or combinations of other ordnance totaling up to 20,000 pounds . The ARRW, and other weapons, will likely demand new loading systems. With this and other weapons in mind, the Air Force has been testing out a prototype of the MHU-TSX, a robotic loading system developed by Square One Systems Design. The Wyoming-based robotics development company describes itself as specializing “in the design and development of innovative automated systems, precision positioning devices, and robots for diverse industries.” “You can attach a sensor package that allows the machine to operate with a high degree of autonomy,” said Viola. “Personnel would only need to supervise what it’s doing, which should make the loading process quicker.” Again, this plays squarely into the concept of austere operations, permitting bomber sorties to maintain their tempo even with a reduced ground crew complement on hand. Jace Walsh, Square One Systems Design senior controls engineer, demonstrates using the controller for the prototype MHU-TSX robotic loading system at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, September 14, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class William Pugh Compared to legacy systems, the prototype MHU-TSX is based around a non-hydraulic actuation process, which translates to more precise movements. While careful handling of munitions is fundamental wherever a bomber is operating, this factor can come into play above all when aircraft are operating from austere airfields, which are unlikely to be perfectly flat. Even when operating bombers from established bases, the MHU-TSX could provide significant advantages. At Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, for instance, there are no facilities to pre-load the Common Rotary Launchers (CRL) that are used to provide Air Force bombers with their cruise missiles or to store these launchers pre-loaded for more rapid installation on an aircraft. It can take ground crews nearly half a day to load missiles, one at a time, onto launchers already installed in the bombers’ bomb bays. That also gives some indication of how laborious and time-consuming loading bombers’ armaments can be, something that a mature version of MHU-TSX should address. In the meantime, Andersen is gaining a new Standoff Weapons Complex that will provide storage for pre-loaded CRLs, a project you can read all about here . The prototype MHU-TSX was tested recently by the 2nd Maintenance Group at Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana, home of Air Force Global Strike Command’s 2nd Bomb Wing flying the B-52 and also responsible for training all crews for the veteran bomber. A 707th Maintenance Squadron weapons load crew undergoes evaluation during an Air-Launched Cruise Missile loading operation on a B-52 at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana., U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Greg Steele The effort resulted from a collaboration between the AFWERX innovation initiative , a technology incubator the Air Force established in 2017, and Square One Systems Design. AFWERX is intended to develop partnerships between the service and tech specialists in the private business sphere, and this is not the first robotics-related project it has fostered. “We were aware that weapons loading was an ongoing area that the Air Force would like to see modernized and we’d actually done some early concepts,” said Bob Viola, the director of engineering at Square One Systems Design. “AFWERX was our conduit in, then Global Strike Command and Material Command became responsive to our ideas, from there becoming our partners within the program.” Work on the MHU-TSX was launched in spring 2019, the Air Force formally designating the project as the “Munitions Loading, Robotics, Supervised Autonomy, MHU-83, MJ-1, Tri-Sphere.” In Air Force parlance, MHU denotes a Munitions Handling Unit. Meanwhile, the veteran status of the B-52 within the Air Force inventory is well known, but what’s perhaps less evident is that much of the support equipment needed for it to complete its mission is similarly dated. 2nd Maintenance Group personnel operate the prototype MHU-TSX robotic loading system at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, on September 15, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class William Pugh “The design of our current equipment is between 50 to 60 years old,” explained Mike Black, an Air Force Global Strike Command munitions division modernization branch chief. Not only is equipment such as weapons loading systems old, but increasingly it will be redundant as new weapons come online, especially the new types of heavy hypersonic missiles that are expected to form a key part of the future arsenal of the B-52, in particular. Indeed, as long ago as 2018, The War Zone examined why the B-52 lends itself so well to the role of hypersonic weapons ‘truck.’ Since then, the AGM-183A ARRW, has put itself on course to be the Air Force’s first operational air-launched hypersonic weapon , although early testing from the B-52 has not gone entirely smoothly . A B-52 from the 419th Flight Test Squadron out of Edwards Air Force Base, California, carries a prototype of the AGM-183A ARRW for its first captive-carry flight, in 2019., U.S. Air Force/Christopher Okula At this stage, the MHU-TSX, as tested at Barksdale, is very much an early iteration, with the trial aimed primarily to get feedback from the munitions squadron and other personnel at the base, which will lead to improvements being made. According to an Air Force news release “revisions are expected,” for the design, but there is already confidence that MHU-TSX “is a step towards an automated machine that could revolutionize aircraft maintenance Air Force-wide.” Second Maintenance Group personnel prepare a pylon from the now-retired AGM-86 Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) for transport on the Square One Systems Design prototype at Barksdale Air Force Base, September 14, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class William Pugh The Air Force, meanwhile, is confident that AFWERX is the right framework within which to develop a product of this kind. Mike Black described the current relationship between the Air Force and Square One Systems Design as “about as close as you can get to the ideal scenario for AFWERX and their business model.” How much longer it will take to field a fully proven and operational version of the MHU-TSX is not clear, but it’s evident that the twin demands of heavy hypersonic stores and out-of-area operations mean that equipment of this kind is likely to be afforded a high priority in the near future. It would not be the first Air Force program that stresses modular, deployable equipment of the kind needed for these kinds of missions. All in all, the MHU-TSX could provide the Air Force bomber fleet with some huge advantages, helping reduce the total manpower, as well as the infrastructure, necessary to conduct bomber operations from austere sites on short notice, which could make it easier to conduct those kinds of deployments in general.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 22, 2021",Boeing Unveils New Two-Stage Long-Range Air-To-Air Missile Concept,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has shown off a new long-range air-to-air missile design at the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, which opened today. The weapon, referred to as the Long-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or LRAAM, has a two-stage configuration with a “kill vehicle” attached to a booster section that falls away after it is burned out, something that has been seen in previous U.S. military air-to-air missile concepts . A Boeing representative told The War Zone that the company had crafted the LRAAM design in response to a so-called Broad Area Announcement (BAA) from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) last year that asked companies to submit ideas to meet a host of advanced technologies desired for future long-range air-to-air missiles. AFRL said design submissions could be based around single and multi-stage rocket motors, as well as air-breathing engines, such as ramjets. However, it added that it was particularly interested in, among other things, throttleable “ multi-pulse solid rocket motors ” and novel “ propellants, grain configurations , cases, and liners” that would be able to deliver greater speeds, as well as ranges, compared to existing weapons, such as the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). A model of Boeing’s Long-Range Air-to-Air Missile concept., Joseph Trevithick Boeing said that LRAAM, which is very much still in the conceptual stage of development, is focused mainly the “boosted” propulsiton aspect of the design, in which the rear section, which has a body very similar to that of the kill vehicle attached in front, provides an initial burst of speed and carries the entire weapon out to a certain range, at which point it falls away. Another rocket motor in the front section would then ignite and propel it during the remainder of its flight. The kill vehicle and booster bodies, which share what appears to be an identical core shape, are not directly based on any existing Boeing design, the company representative told us. Using the same basic body design for both sections would help give it a more uniform form factor and could help simplify production and keep costs down. The weapon also leverages technology Boeing developed for separate projects and work on the concept has made use of new digital engineering and design techniques, which are becoming increasingly popular, in general, among American defense contractors and within the U.S. military itself. Given the weapon’s early state of development, there is limited information about LRAAM’s expected performance and other capabilities. However, the concept, overall, is supposed to provide a missile that has significant speed and range, as well as a high degree of maneuverability in the terminal stage of an engagement. The expected added ability to maneuver comes from using a separate kill vehicle, which reduces drag and weight compared to a similarly sized single-stage weapon throughout its flight. The term “kill vehicle” here may also indicate a hit-to-kill design that uses the sheer force of impact to destroy the target, rather than a warhead. Not needing a warhead would allow Boeing to optimize the weapon’s fuel capacity and maneuverability, while also keeping the overall package relatively small. It is also worth pointing out that this configuration opens up the possibility of using the front section by itself as a weapon for shorter-range engagements. Depending on the exact size of something like LRAAM’s kill vehicle, it might also be of interest as a compact missile that stealthy aircraft could carry internally in greater quantities than existing designs, such as the AIM-120. It’s not clear whether or not the design allows for more than one booster to be used in combination with a single kill vehicle. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter fires an AIM-120 AMRAAM from its main internal weapons bay., USAF Boeing also specifically said that it was their view that LRAAM would not compete with existing air-to-air missile programs of record, indicating that the company sees this weapon as providing an added capability for the Air Force, rather direct replacement for any other design. This would make some immediate sense given that the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM), a separate effort that the Air Force is working on with the U.S. Navy, is intended to be, at least in part, a direct replacement for the AIM-120. In addition, the Air Force has made clear in the past that AIM-260 is unrelated to another advanced air-to-air missile project, called the Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW), a project that had been run through the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Previous LREW concept art also showed a two-stage missile design, one that was depicted as being small enough to fit inside an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter’s main internal weapons bay. An artist’s conception of a notional Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW)., DOD VIA FLIGHTGLOBAL.COM All of this could also point to LRAAM, or other air-to-air missile projects AFRL may be looking to support through this technology development effort, having a distinct mission set from the future AIM-260 and the existing AIM-120. Over the past two decades, the Air Force has worked, sometimes in cooperation with the Navy, on at least three different programs to develop a very long-range air-to-air missile, but one that would also be able to function as anti-radiation missiles to engage air-defense radars and other emitters on the ground. You can read more about all of these developments here . LRAAM seems optimized for air-to-air target sets alone. It’s also interesting to note that, earlier this year, it emerged that the Air Force was looking to integrate a new “outsize … air-to-air” missile onto its forthcoming F-15EX Eagle II aircraft. Though no further details were provided about this weapon, it seemed highly unlikely that this was a reference to the AIM-260, which is expected to have a general form factor similar, if not identical, to the existing AIM-120. The AMRAAM is certainly not an outsized design. This, in turn, has prompted discussion about whether this might point to continued work on LREW, or a follow-on project. As already noted, LRAAM would, in many ways, seem to suggest it is related, at least tangentially, to these other past long-range air-to-air missile developments. An artist’s conception of a pair of F-15EX jets with air-to-air loadouts consisting of 10 AIM-120s. The Air Force is looking at these aircraft, which have impressive overall payload capacities, as potential platforms for a host of new weapons, including a new, outsized air-to-air missile., Boeing Regardless, the demand within the Air Force, as well as the Navy, for longer-ranged air-to-air missiles is only increasing. It is known that China’s PL-15 , analogous in very broad strokes to the AIM-120D variant of the AMRAAM, was a key factor behind the start of the AIM-260 program. Pictures have previously emerged of a Chinese J-16 Flanker fighter jet carrying a much larger air-to-air missile , which could be intended to bring down American airborne early warning and other similarly high-value supporting aircraft, such as tankers and intelligence gathering platforms, at extreme ranges. It would not be surprising for the Air Force to be now looking to adopt its own similar mix of longer-range air-to-air missiles. With Boeing’s LRAAM in such an early stage of development, and it being in response to a broad Air Force technology development effort, the missile’s design may well change significantly as time goes on or see certain features leveraged to support work on other weapon concepts. Regardless, it does seem to reflect another distinct category of air-to-air weapon that the service feels will be an important addition to its future aerial arsenal.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 7, 2021",Five B-21 Raider Stealth Bombers Are Now In Final Assembly,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force now has no fewer than five examples of its secretive Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider stealth bomber in a process of final assembly. That’s three more airframes than we knew about before today and further indication that the new flying-wing bomber is making significant progress, albeit well away from the public gaze. Speaking today during the Air Force Association’s Air, Space, & Cyber Conference, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall confirmed that five Raiders were now taking shape at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. These aircraft are part of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) batch, funded under the Long-Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) contract. We still do not known exactly how many aircraft the USAF expects to receive as part of the EMD phase of the program, a validation period that occurs before full rate production, but this is the most information about this particular aspect that has been released to date. The Air Force eventually hopes to take delivery of nearly 150 of the new stealth bombers. The program is said to be on budget and relatively close to being on schedule, overall. Six aircraft were also built during a similar phase of the B-2 Advanced Technology Bomber program, and these planes ended up being a major portion of the tiny fleet of 21 that ended up being built. There were additional ground test articles, as well. B-2 taxis by early developmental test articles during the 1990s. , Northrop Grumman Details about the B-21 program in general have been notoriously scarce and, on occasions, there has been some confusion as to the exact status of the aircraft on the assembly line. In the meantime, the countdown to the first flight of a B-21 is very much on, although the planned date for this has slipped from December of this year, with a rollout of the aircraft now expected in early 2022, according to officials. If that timeline is kept, then a first Raider would likely take to the air in the late spring or early summer of the same year. As expectation grows, the Air Force has fed observers with only meager tidbits, providing an idea of how the B-21 is likely to look. But these, too, have been somewhat cryptic. Most recently, a rendering released in July — only the third from official channels — revealed a previously unseen and unusual-looking cockpit windscreen configuration. What is more, there is no guarantee that the aircraft will accurately resemble the few renderings we have seen so far. B-21 rendering over Edwards AFB., USAF Regardless, a sprawling facility at Edwards Air Force Base in California awaits the bomber’s testing program, which will be run by the already stood-up B-21 Combined Test Force . Long-term, the USAF expects the B-21 to enter service at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, sometime in the mid-2020s, followed by Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. Officials have described the new stealth bomber as being key to the Pentagon’s nuclear modernization program, itself a “top priority for the Department of Defense and the Air Force,” according to Randall Walden, the director of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. Of course, the B-21 will be more than just a bomber. It will eventually be an optionally manned, nuclear-capable , multi-role strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform that will enable other platforms, as well as be enabled by other platforms, as part of a family of advanced systems . Beyond knowing that it will be a high-flying design that traces its roots to the B-2’s early development, it will possess broadband low-observability (next-generation stealth technology), and it will be smaller than its B-2 progenitor, specifics remain very limited. One thing that is apparent is that it will leverage many mature subsystems and sensors that are either in production or already or have had major risk-reduction work done on them. Overall it will be much more flexible and adaptable than the B-2, as well. B-21 concept art. , USAF In other words, this should be an incredibly remarkable weapon system. Yet for some, being able to survive in enemy airspace won’t be what impresses them the most about it; developing it on budget and on schedule and producing it in large numbers will. Of course, the verdict on how all that will play out remains up in the air, but so far every indication seems positive.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The Air Force Blew It When It Decided Not To Give Its KC-135s Winglets 40 Years Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Take a look out the window the next time you fly on an airliner and there’s a very good chance you’ll see winglets — the typically upturned wingtip devices at the ends of the wings designed to improve efficiency by reducing drag. As well as being commonplace on new designs, winglets have been retrofitted to a variety of older aircraft, too, like the ubiquitous Boeing 737 series , to improve performance and lower fuel costs. One of the types that doesn’t have them is the U.S. Air Force’s hard-worked fleet of KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refuelers and their many derivatives . But the reality is that winglets were tested on the KC-135. In fact, the type played a major part in pioneering the concept. The results were overwhelming. As such, it’s maddening to comprehend that the KC-135 never got winglets decades ago. Much of the drive that led to a KC-135 flying with winglets — as early as 1979, long before they became commonplace — was the energy crisis of that same decade. The effects of the Yom Kippur War caused interruptions in exports of Middle Eastern oil and Western countries began to feel the pinch, with another worsening of the situation in 1979, triggered by the Iranian Revolution and the events that followed . As the crisis drove up fuel prices, the effects were felt keenly by the gas-thirsty Air Force. A close-up of the KC-135 winglet, fitted with tufts to examine wake , NASA DFRC At NASA’s Langley Research Center, meanwhile, Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb had come up with the winglet concept, noting that its addition to a wingtip reduced drag and in the process saved fuel. Interestingly, Whitcomb had also been responsible for developing the ‘Coke bottle’ area-ruled fuselage in the 1950s, before coming up with the supercritical wing that’s another efficiency-boosting feature of many jet transports today. As such, his is a name that certainly deserves to be better known. After the successful wind-tunnel tests of the Whitcom winglets at Langley, a memorandum of understanding was signed in 1976 for a joint development program between NASA and the Air Force. In June the following year, Boeing received a $3-million contract to develop, install, and then test a set of winglets on a KC-135. At this stage, the wind-tunnel tests showed that the modification should reduce total drag by 8 percent during cruise flight. Based on that improvement, the Air Force was expected to cut annual fuel demands by a figure of an incredible 37 million gallons across the entire fleet. Work on the winglets ran for much of the first half of 1978 and, before the end of the same year, the Air Force’s NKC-135A testbed , serial number 55-3129, had been transferred to NASA at Edwards Air Force Base, California, for the modifications. Winglets, the elegant upturned composite structures seen at the tips of most airliners’ wings today, are a ‘no-brainer’ option even for older aircraft as they save gobs of fuel over an aircraft’s operational life. Here we see a 757 with retrofitted winglets. , Moto “Club4AG” Miwa/WIkicommons By May 1979, it was time to install the winglets, which had been produced by converting the wingtips of another KC-135A, serial number 55-3126, a former Speckled Trout VIP transport . Each winglet weighed around 150 pounds, was approximately 9 feet high, and could be set to different angles of incidence to gather a range of test data. A long boom containing air-data measuring equipment was added to the nose, completing 55-3129’s new look, and this provided real-time flight-test data that was presented on a CRT display in the cockpit. Between July 1979 and January 1981, the winglet-equipped 55-3129 completed 39 flights and over 170 flying hours in this configuration, demonstrating a 6.5 percent fuel saving throughout the aircraft’s usual flight regime, equivalent to nearly 45 million gallons per year across the entire fleet. At the same time, the reconfigured aircraft also demonstrated improved takeoff performance and fuel offload capability. The winglet-equipped NKC-135A testbed, serial number 55-3129, in flight., NASA DFRC Despite the obvious promise of the winglets, the Air Force was not interested in the modification and instead chose to take an alternative path toward fuel savings. This was the Fuel Savings Advisory/Cockpit Avionics System (FSA/CAS), a flight-management system based on a new computer. Compared to the winglets, the advantages of FSA/CAS were disappointing — just a 2 percent saving on fuel, and this was only achieved with the KC-135 flying a specially tailored, airliner-style flight profile, which had little in common with the Stratotanker’s normal missions. On the plus side, the FSA/CAS update, which was installed fleet-wide, did bring with it the MIL STD-1553 data bus, making it easier to introduce future cockpit upgrades . As for 55-3129, the aircraft had lost its distinctive winglets before the end of 1981 and was returned to the Air Force for various other test duties. IRobert S. Hopkins III, who flew 17 different variants of KC-135 tankers, EC-135 airborne command posts, and RC-135 strategic reconnaissance aircraft during his Air Force career, and now writes extensively about these aircraft and others , recalled to The War Zone that NASA, Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC), and Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) were “all for the winglets. They reduced drag consistently over the entire flight spectrum, meaning they saved fuel from takeoff to landing.” A somewhat artistic study of the NKC-135A under test. The 9-foot-high winglets led to a radically altered appearance., NASA DFRC “Strategic Air Command (SAC), however, was less interested in fuel savings per se than the future computerized expandability of the KC-135 and opted for the FSA/CAS,” Hopkins explained. “Unfortunately, that was built on software that mimicked an airliner step-climb profile that was utterly irrelevant to the KC-135 mission profile of takeoff, air refueling, nav leg (all at constant altitude), and landing practice. Fuel savings were in fact less than the promised 6%, averaged 2%, and the damn thing never worked.” “Programming it during preflight was a nightmare,” says Hopkins of the FSA/CAS. “It refused to accept the SAC flight profile as ‘invalid,’ so was a lot like being told ‘if your internet service is down please send us an e-mail.’ It could not be turned off, so I turned the brightness down to full dim to avoid looking at the darn thing.” Had Strategic Air Command known, back in 1981, that the KC-135 fleet would still be serving as the most important part of the Air Force tanker fleet 40 years later, it’s impossible to think that the savings promised by a winglet-equipped fleet of Stratotanker-family aircraft wouldn’t have won broader support. In the event, the Stratotanker family did undergo various other important modifications, most significantly the replacement of the older aircraft’s jet engines, four Pratt & Whitney J57s, with an equal number of more powerful and efficient CFM56s. A CFM56-engined KC-135R Stratotanker from the 134th Air Refueling Wing taxies during an exercise at McGhee Tyson ANG Base, Tennessee., U.S. Air Force Other upgrades since then included Pacer Crag, which replaced various parts of the cockpit and fuel management system between 1997 and 2001. With the Air Force now looking to keep at least a portion of its fleet of nearly 400 KC-135Rs flying until Fiscal Year 2040, and possibly for another decade after that, the savings in fuel costs after the introduction of the winglets many decades ago would have been absolutely massive, to say the least. The fleet of RC-135 intelligence-gathering aircraft is also as busy as ever, monitoring potential hotspots around the globe, and would have similarly benefitted from the additional efficiency offered by winglet modifications. Although, not all those aircraft may have been able to receive the winglets because of where sensors and antenna are placed around the airframe. As well as the Block 45 cockpit upgrades intended to keep the KC-135R viable potentially through to 2050, the Air Force is exploring other capabilities for the venerable Stratotanker, too, including serving as a communications node for other platforms . With an eye on the increasing vulnerability of tankers and other support assets to enemy air defenses, the Air Force is also increasingly looking at ways of protecting its KC-135s, too, including a laser defense system as well as loyal wingman drones . The flight deck of a KC-135R Stratotanker after completing the Block 45 avionics upgrade at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. , U.S. Air Force/Greg L. Davis In the meantime, the near-antique C-135 family is as busy as ever and the introduction of the new KC-46A Pegasus to the aerial refueling community has been painful, to say the least . With that in mind, it seems the Air Force really did miss a big opportunity when it had the chance to equip these aircraft with winglets back in the early 1980s. The modifications would have paid for themselves many, many times over by now, and then some. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On September 7, 2021, an RC-135U Combat Sent electronic intelligence-gathering aircraft, one of just two in existence, made a frightening crosswind landing at RAF Mildenhall in England. The RC-135 had returned from an intriguing mission that saw the spy plane circumnavigate the border of Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave . The video comes to us from the YouTube channel Airshow World , via a heads up from our friend and a must-follow on Twitter, @thenewarea51 . It shows the RC-135U, often lovingly referred to as ‘U-Boat’ due to its designation, making a crabbed approach to Runway 28 at RAF Mildenhall. It then appears to struggle to ‘kick-out’ the crab on landing, with its left wing suddenly dipping in a highly concerning manner. If the crab is not relieved and the aircraft’s nose is not pointed down the runway on touchdown, at least to a substantial degree, it is very hard on the aircraft, and especially the landing gear, putting major lateral loads on the mains. The crew subsequently wrangled the RC-135 and straightened it up during its roll-out, but its rudder is still seen kicking around frantically even after it has come to a slow taxi. While the landing looks very “eventful” for the pilots, the folks in the back must have had a very chilling experience. If the video does not automatically advance, the landing in question occurs at 17:55. A substantial number of the venerable C-135 family were re-engined, including the RC-135s, with low-hanging CFM56 high-bypass turbofan engines. While this greatly improved the aircraft’s performance and reliability, it made the type more sensitive to bank angles on landing as the outboard engines hung so much lower than their predecessors. A track of the RC-135U’s mission that day. , Flightradar24 Note the dramatic altitude and speed changes during its intel collection run., Flightradar24 The aircraft’s route back to RAF Mildenhall., Flightradar24 One KC-135 pilot told me that they are limited to just a few degrees of bank on landing, any more could cause ‘pod (nacelle) strike’ which is a very unwelcome and dangerous occurrence. As a result, a wing-low landing is not really an option to correct for a crosswind. That’s why the video is especially concerning—seeing a jet that is not supposed to bank so much on touchdown, doing so. The winds at the base at the time of the landing were at about 10 knots directly perpendicular to the runway. So the crosswind component would have been pretty much total. There may have been gusts that would have complicated the situation, although we can’t say for sure. RC-135U refueling. , USAF Still, at least for the KC-135, which is the cousin of the RC-135, the crosswind limit is 25 knots. So, barring any major gusts, this landing occurred well below that limit. With all that in mind, it really isn’t clear what occurred here. Was it just a crosswind landing that went a bit off the rails, or perhaps some sort of flight control issue? We have reached out to some of our contacts with experiencing flying these aircraft to provide some insights, and will report back when they do. UPDATE: Our friend, veteran RC-135 pilot , writer of the KC-135 ‘bible,’ and War Zone contributor , Robert Hopkins, told us that although the building and berm block a clear view, the aircraft appears to have made a three-point landing or even landed on its nose wheel, which could have accounted for the wobble rollout. Damage to the nose wheel and/or its steering is possible. Adding extra details, Hopkins told The War Zone: The way the jet lurched forward, I think the pilot flying flared high, realized it, then pushed the nose over to try and land, the other pilot took over, and the best s/he could do was a 3-point plant with (likely) a pod [engine necelle] drag. The best thing to do in a premature flare in a crosswind is to go around. Never push the nose down.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After being damaged during an emergency landing that saw the bomber depart the runway Whiteman AIr Force Base in Missouri in the wee hours of the morning on Tuesday, September 14th, a stricken B-2 has finally been moved off the grass and into a hangar. The prized stealth bomber had come to a rest on its wing following an apparent main landing gear collapse after experiencing a major malfunction in flight. A temporary flight restriction was put into place around the B-2’s home base as recovery and investigative efforts following the mishap commenced. Satellite imagery taken yesterday at around noon shows the damaged B-2 had been moved back onto the runway from where it had been resting adjacent to it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 15, 2021",Russian-Made Mi-17 Helicopter Flown By Secretive U.S. Unit Lands In Farmer’s Field,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this year, Dan Moore, who owns a farm in North Carolina, had unusual visits by not one, but two secretive aircraft. After a Russian-made Mi-17 Hip -type helicopter made an emergency landing, a dark gray Bell 407 arrived with replacement parts. The Bell 407 may well have been one of a trio that flew around the greater Los Angeles area in California earlier this year, something The War Zone covered extensively , and both of these helicopters may belong to an especially shadowy U.S. military aviation unit. Moore, who is currently a member of the Civil Air Patrol, among other things, and has been a pilot for many years, had his encounter with these helicopters in May. However, he shared this story in more detail in a piece that the Air Facts aviation journal published this week. “I received a call from my neighbor saying, ‘Hey, did you know there is a helicopter in your front yard?'” Moore wrote of the event. “Wait, what? A helicopter? In my yard? I was confused, but also primed and ready to return the favor when I figured out somebody had made an emergency landing at my farm.” “Living in North Carolina, there is a lot of military activity in the airspace around me… So my answer to my neighbor was, ‘Huh? No. No idea what is going on. What kind of helicopter?'” he continued. “My neighbor, who is in the special forces at Ft. Bragg [a major U.S. Army base in North Carolina] said, ‘I don’t know. I’ve never seen one like it. Some big military thing.'” The helicopter in question was an Mi-17-type with a tan-and-brown camouflage scheme, as well as a big black-painted section on at least the right side of the fuselage behind the exhaust for one of its two turboshaft engines. The pictures and videos that Moore took of this helicopter don’t show any clearly obvious markings to identify who the operator is. However, it did have a host of military features, including a sensor ball turret under the right side of the cockpit, as well as supplemental armor panels on either side. A large particle separator, useful for operations in sandy or otherwise dusty environments, was fitted to the front of the helicopter’s two engine intakes. Its tail boom was covered in antennas, including a platter-type one typically associated with high-frequency satellite communications (SATCOM) systems. Moore said he had his neighbor give his phone number to the helicopter’s crew and soon got a call from the crew chief, who explained the situation. The Mi-17 would need to stay on his property until it could be repaired. “My answer?” Moore recounted. “At the barn there is a white truck. The keys are in it. Go into town to get what you need. In the barn there is a full machine shop with all the tooling and supplies. The shop is open, go get what tools you need. I’ll be there in two hours.” He said that the crew chief was a bit caught off guard by this show of hospitality. They didn’t take him up on his offer, either. When Moore got to his farm he found the helicopter’s crew pulling out a hydraulic oil cooler, which was apparently the root cause of the incident. “I found the pilot and we chatted about what was going on. I explained that he’d landed at the single best place to put down he could have,” Moore said. “He seemed pretty non-plussed till I explained that the pasture where he was sitting had power lines running through it till about a year before when I’d moved them to make the runway. And that all the other areas along his route of flight were either swamp or trees or houses. He turned a touch green when he realized what I was saying. He was in the only safe place he could put down.” Moore and his son, who “wants to fly helicopters in the Army and has been working towards that end for several years now,” talked with the helicopter crew for a bit longer. He says when they finally got a stopping conversation and were about to leave, that’s when they learned spare parts were on the way. “Driving from where?” Moore asked. “Oh no, they are flying in,” he got in response. The Bell 407 subsequently arrived with what the crew needed to get the Hip up and running around. It also has a serial number on the tail, but it is not visible in the video Moore took of it. This dark gray helicopter is a dead ringer for a trio of others that were spotted flying around Los Angeles and other nearby locales in January. If it is not one of those same three aircraft it has an identical configuration . Among other features, it has the same “ egg-beater ” or “ O Wing ” type ultra-high-frequency (UHF) SATCOM antenna on the tail boom and a pair of blade-type antennas under the forward fuselage that are generally associated with high-frequency radios or other communications systems. It also has the same type of high landing skids, which are mo commonly found on helicopters used for utility work, as well as law enforcement and military duties. This smaller helicopter unloaded its cargo and left relatively quickly. By the next morning, the Mi-17 was good to go and had taken off, headed again for wherever its destination might have been. As for what organization these helicopters belong to and who is flying them, not surprisingly, they didn’t say, according to Moore. “These guys were all former military and they were doing some sort of REDACTED for REDACTED. It was all very hush hush,” he said, adding that they told him they “were visiting from out of state.” It’s also unclear whether it’s a typo in the Air Facts story or if the crew of the Mi-17 deliberately gave him bad information, but Moore said they told him that helicopter “was an MI-24, the export version of another common helicopter in the Soviet Union.” It is definitely not an Mi-24 Hind , which is a distinctly different helicopter gunship. When the dark gray Bell 407s appeared over Los Angeles earlier this year, The War Zone explored a number of possibilities as to who might own them. A highly secretive U.S. Army element known as the Aviation Technology Office (ATO), which is based at Felker Army Airfield, part of Fort Eustis, in Virginia, remains the most likely operator of those helicopters – and, by extension, these ones. This likelihood is further bolstered by the fact that ATO, which was previously known as the Flight Concepts Division (FCD) and, along with its own predecessor organizations, has long-standing ties to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is also understood to operate foreign-made types, including Mi-17 variants. Satellite imagery of Felker regularly shows Bell 407s sharing the ramp with Mi-17s near ATO/FCD’s main hangar. One image, available through Bing Maps, is high resolution enough that you can clearly see an Mi-17-type helicopter in very similar, if not identical configurations to the one that touched down on Moore’s farm. A satellite image of Felker Army Airfield taken on Dec. 2, 2020. Three Bell 407s are visible on the ramp to the right, as are five Mi-17-type helicopters., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION A high-resolution satellite image showing an Mi-17-type helicopter at Felker Army Airfield., Bing Maps Pictures have been floating around online for years of another Hip , an Mi-171E variant with the serial number 15-5207 on its tail boom, with many of the same features. This helicopter is also widely understood to be operated by some element of the U.S. military, or some other arm of the U.S. government, such as the CIA. The CIA has its own long history of operating Mi-17-type helicopters , especially in support of its activities in Afghanistan over the past two decades. Hips associated with the agency were notably spotted and otherwise tracked flying in and around Kabul , helping its people and Afghans who had worked with them get to Hamid Karzai International Airport to evacuate, in the weeks leading up to the final withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country last month. Another shadowy Mi-171E, which carries the serial number 15-5207 on the tail boom, sitting at Springerville Municipal Airport in Arizona in 2016. Like the Hip that touched down on Dan Moore’s farm in North Carolina earlier this year, it also has a number of antennas on its tail boom, including one generally associated with high-frequency satellite communications systems toward the rear. It also has a large particle separator in front of the engine intakes. Other pictures of 15-5207 available online show that, in more recent years, it has been fitted with the same kind of sensor turret and supplemental armor as the one that touched down on Dan Moore’s farm., SPRINGERVILLE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT You can read more about ATO/FDC, which is one of the most secretive U.S. military aviation units known to be in existence today, in these past War Zone pieces . From what is publicly known, this unit provides very specialized, as well as discreet aviation support for special operations forces during covert and clandestine missions. It also has a bleeding-edge developmental role, helping to craft what’s next in Army aviation, which sometimes aligns with its operational mission sets. For instance, it is understood to have led the development of the stealthy derivatives of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that were used in the raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in 2011 that led to the death of then-Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Altogether, Dan Moore’s tale about how his farm briefly turned into a small heliport is certainly unique in its most basic details. It is only made more so when one considers just how rare an opportunity he and his son were given to be so close to these shy helicopters and their crews.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 28, 2021",Lockheed Is Bringing Back The Airbus A330 Tanker To Compete Against Boeing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has formally unveiled its proposal, dubbed LMXT, to meet the U.S. Air Force’s requirements for additional aerial refueling tankers to “ bridge the gap ” between the last expected deliveries of Boeing KC-46A Pegasuses and the acquisition of a future advanced tanker, a project currently referred to simply as KC-Z. The LMXT is based on the popular Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport , or MRTT, but has a number of features specifically for the Air Force, including additional networking and defensive capabilities. It also has the ability to carry 13 tons of additional fuel over the standard MRTT, for a total maximum load of just over 135 tons of gas, both for its own use and to dispense to receiver aircraft. The Maryland-headquartered defense giant officially unveiled its LMXT offering on Sept. 17, 2021. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center issued a formal Sources Sought notice for the Bridge Tanker Program , also referred to as KC-Y, back in June. The service says it will only consider “non-developmental” proposals based on commercial aircraft as part of this competition, which is expected to officially kick off by the end of next year. An artist’s conception of Lockheed Martin’s LMXT aerial refueling tanker linked up with a US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter., Lockheed Martin The expectation is that whatever tanker it selected will help the Air Force finally replace its aging fleet of just under 400 KC-135s , as well as its smaller fleet of KC-10As, the latter of which are already being retired . At present, the service only expects to buy 179 KC-46As across 13 production lots. Boeing is widely expected to propose additional KC-46A orders for the KC-Y competition, which could lead to the winner getting a contract to build up to 160 new aircraft . All of the US Air Force’s current aerial refueling tankers. From left to right, the KC-135, the KC-46, and the KC-10., USAF “Lockheed Martin has a long and successful track record of producing aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, and we understand the critical role tankers play in ensuring America’s total mission success,” Greg Ulmer, the Executive Vice President of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in a statement. “The LMXT combines proven performance and operator-specific capabilities to meet the Air Force’s refueling requirements in support of America’s National Defense Strategy.” Aviation Week had been first to report on the proposal, yesterday. Lockheed Martin had publicly disclosed the basic existence of its LMXT plans to a select group of reporters, including this author, on the sidelines of an event last month to mark the opening of a new advanced manufacturing facility at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. Back in 2018, the company had announced it was partnering with Airbus to offer “advanced refueling solutions” to the U.S. Air Force, specifically. Airbus had also previously worked with Northrop Grumman to pitch the A330 MRTT to the Air Force on multiple occasions , before ultimately losing out to Boeing’s KC-46A. Lockheed Martin says the LMXT, which it would produce in the United States, builds on the proven capabilities of the A330 MRTT and will also include the more recently developed automatic boom/air-to-air refueling (A3R) system. Airbus has said in the past A3R improved the speed at which A330 MRTTs can link up with receiver aircraft and provides additional margins of safety for both them and the tanker itself. https://youtube.com/watch?v=eKZ30lMnl9w The LMXT will also have a number of U.S.-specific features, including unspecified defense capabilities. In addition, they will have open-architecture mission systems designed from the outset to work with various advanced networking and associated capabilities that the U.S. military, as a whole, is developing under the umbrella of an initiative known as Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2). The Air Force is already exploring adding advanced communications relay nodes , as well as the ability to control semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drones for self-defense, to its existing tankers as part of the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) effort, which is the service’s component of JADC2. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EuFTr53cer0 Still, the most significant component of the LMXT package may actually be the one that seems the most mundane, the added fuel capacity. The standard A330 MRTT, with its maximum fuel load of 111 tons, already carries more gas than the KC-46A. Lockheed Martin says adding 13 more tons on top of that will only allow the LMXT to refuel more aircraft per sortie, as well as give the tanker itself greater overall range and time on station. However, the LMXT, like typical A330 MRTTs, lacks a main cargo deck with a large side-opening door for oversized loads. This is a feature on the Air Force’s existing KC-135s, KC-10s, and KC-46As. All of these tankers have important, if largely underappreciated secondary cargo and passenger-carrying roles – the whole reason they carry the “KC” or “Tanker-Cargo” nomenclature. An infographic showing various configurations of the A330 MRTT, as well as the ability to readily reconfigure its interior to support aerial refueling, cargo and passenger-carrying, and medical evacuation missions., Airbus The even greater emphasis on aerial refueling, rather than other roles, makes the LMXT distinct from previously rejected pitches to the Air Force involving the A330 MRTT. It’s important to note that those proposals were also submitted to competitions that were mired in controversy , part of a long-range tanker acquisition saga that dated back to the early 2000s. This included one scandal the emerged between 2003 and 2004 that was so severe that it resulted in Darleen Druyun, who had served for a time as the Air Force’s top acquisition official, being convicted on corruption charges and serving a nine-month prison sentence . Lockheed Martin clearly hopes now that the LMXT’s massive fuel load, along with its other features, will set it firmly apart from the KC-46A, which has struggled for years, due to a host of technical issues and quality control problems, to live up to the Air Force’s expectations. The company’s press release notably says that its A330 MRTT-based offering will have a “proven fly-by-wire boom” and “operational and combat proven advanced camera and vision system.” These reflect major issues that the Air Force is dealing with on its Pegasuses that have limited their ability to serve in their primary role as tankers. Many earlier tanker designs, such as the KC-135 and KC-10, have the boom operator physically lie at the rear of the aircraft. From there they steer the end of the boom into the receiving aircraft. The A330 MRTT puts the boom operator in the aircraft’s main cabin, where they use a remote vision system, linked to an array of cameras at the back of the plane, to perform their task. The KC-46A also has a hybrid 2D/3D remote vision system that has been riddled with issues and can be dangerous to use in some situations, as you can read about more here . Earlier this year, the Pentagon’s Office of the Inspector General also released a report slamming the Air Force and Boeing over the design process behind the Pegasus’ boom itself. Boeing is in the process of developing fixes for both the remote vision system and the boom, which are both years away from being integrated into the majority of KC-46As that the Air Force has in service now. All told, the LMXT’s aerial refueling optimized configuration could be an attractive selling point for the Air Force, given the difficulties it is still facing with regards to the KC-46A. At the same time, it’s not clear whether the added fuel capacity would outweigh the aircraft’s more limited payload-carrying capacity compared to the Pegasus. It is also interesting to note that U.S. Transportation Command, in cooperation with the Air Force, has been exploring options for contractor-owned and/or operated tankers to support a variety of non-combat refueling requirements, which you can read more about here . Even if the Air Force decides against buying LMXTs as a bridge tanker for its own use, a simplified version of the plane without the networking and other advanced capabilities could offer an attractive option for contractors , including Lockheed Martin and Airbus themselves, looking to exclusively provide refueling services. Airbus is already part of a contractor aerial refueling consortium, AirTanker, which is under contract with the U.K. Royal Air Force. Even if, as expected, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are the only two companies to submit bridge tanker proposals, the LMXT pitch makes clear that it will still be a very heated competition.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 4, 2021",UK Starts Work On A New Nuclear Submarine Right After Australia Says It’s Looking To Buy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom has kicked off the process of introducing a next-generation nuclear-powered submarine, to replace the Royal Navy’s current Astute class . Investment in the new program, named the Submersible Ship Nuclear Replacement, or SSNR, was announced just two days after it was confirmed that the United Kingdom and the United States would work together with Australia to provide the latter with a new nuclear-powered submarine , at least eight of which are planned. Today’s announcement from the U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) outlined a total of around $234 million with which to kickstart the SSNR effort. These funds will be split equally between BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce, which will both undertake concept and design work for the next-generation submarines. According to U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, those two firms are already engaged in that design work. An Astute class submarine on the surface with the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth in the background during the current Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) deployment., Crown Copyright The investment will ensure work continues on SSNR over the next three years and will support 350 jobs — around 250 with BAE Systems in Barrow and another 100 at Rolls-Royce in Derby. While BAE Systems is responsible for the design of the overall platform, Rolls-Royce will produce the propulsion systems, known as the Nuclear Steam Raising Plant. Other companies will be involved, too, with the MOD mentioning the shipbuilder Babcock International in its formal SSNR announcement. The end result of this preliminary design work will “inform a future decision which will help define the replacement approach for the Astute class.” Currently, the Royal Navy has four of the Astute class submarines in service, with the newest, HMS Audacious , to be formally commissioned next week. The Astute class boats have a submerged displacement 7,400 tons and are the largest attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy. With a length of 318 feet, they can carry both Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) and Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes . The manufacturer attributes the boats with a 90-day dived endurance, only limited by the amount of food that can be carried and the endurance of the crew. Meanwhile, another three of the older Trafalgar class are still in use, and these will eventually be replaced by three more Astutes — of these, HMS Anson is undergoing final trials and testing, while the last two, HMS Agamemnon and Agincourt , are being completed. One of the Trafalgars, HMS Trenchant, has already been laid up pending decommissioning and all seven of the Astutes that the Royal Navy plans to buy are expected to be in service by 2026. As for the Trafalgar boats, these were designed in the Cold War, have a submerged displacement of 5,210 tons, length of 280 feet, and can be armed with the same main weapons as the Astutes . With less automation, they have a larger crew complement than the Astute class, with 130 compared to 89 personnel. HMS Trenchant breaks through the ice of the North Pole during Ice Exercise 18. This is the latest Trafalgar class SSN to prepare for decommissioning., Crown Copyright “Marking the start of a new journey for the Royal Navy’s submarines, British designers and engineers will lead the way in developing submarines for our Royal Navy,” said U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. “This multi-million-pound investment ensures that this vital capability will be ready to replace our Astute class submarines as they come out of service, whilst supporting high-skilled jobs across the Midlands [Derby] and North West [Barrow],” Wallace continued. “Designing and building submarines is one of the most complex and challenging feats of engineering that the maritime industry undertakes,” added Ian Booth, CEO of the U.K.’s Submarine Delivery Agency. “It is essential that work on the next-generation underwater capability commences as early as possible. This relies on some of the nation’s most experienced defense nuclear experts from the very beginning of the design phase,” Booth added. So far, we have no idea what the final SSNR design might look like, with the MOD and Royal Navy announcements being illustrated by images of the current Astute class. However, the ministry confirms it is already looking at “a range of options.” HMS Audacious , the fourth Astute class SSN, and the most recent to enter service with the Royal Navy, in April 2020., BAE Systems As to when the new SSNRs might be expected to begin entering service, the Royal Navy has said that at least some of its current Astute class boats are likely to serve “into the second half of the 21st century,” based on each boat serving for at least 25 years. However, the first of these SSNs, HMS Astute , has already been in service for more than a decade, so it will require replacement before them. The announcement of the SSNR contract awards so soon after Australia’s dramatic change of course as regards its own next-generation hunter-killer submarine could also be significant. On Wednesday, the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, together with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and U.S. President Joe Biden, announced a new trilateral defense cooperation pact , known as Australia-United Kingdom-United States, or AUKUS. At the center of this is a commitment to expand joint work on new nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), superseding an earlier project to introduce conventionally powered boats of French design. Astutes under construction at BAE Systems’ Devonshire Dock Hall located in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. , BAE SYSTEMS Over the next 18 months, therefore, the U.K. government will work with its U.S. counterpart to ensure Australia finds the “optimal pathway” toward acquiring the new SSNs. At this early stage, it’s not clear whether the RAN’s submarines, which are planned to be built locally, in Adelaide, will be of an all-new design, or if they will be based on an existing U.K. or U.S. design, like the Astute class or the U.S. Virginia class . Today’s development throws up the possibility of an all-new SSN design tailored for both the United Kingdom and Australia, or potentially a subclass of the SSNR design incorporating Australian-specified features. Either way, it is possible that British design may face stiff competition from the United States, either in the shape of the current Virginia class, or derivative thereof, or the all-new SSN(X), which you can read more about here . Of course, it’s also possible that Australia already has a good understanding of what it requires of its SSN, and how the British and/or American designs can be leveraged to achieve that. The Virginia class SSN Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) Mississippi (SSN-782) conducts trials in the Atlantic Ocean., U.S. NAVY Already, Australian media has speculated about the kind of assistance the United Kingdom might provide. The Australian Financial Review has reported that the United Kingdom might take a leading role in helping Australia to establish a domestic capability to build suitable nuclear reactors. Moreover, a joint program, even on a limited level, would likely be attractive to the United Kingdom, offering a way to share costs and potentially drive down the unit price of each SSN. Whatever choice Australia eventually goes with, SSNR underlines the commitment to the U.K.’s Royal Navy, as part of an expanding and modernizing surface and subsurface fleet. To ensure this remains on track, the U.K. Defence Secretary has been given the role of Shipbuilding Tsar, which covers both military and civilian shipbuilding and maritime industries. On the naval side, the increase of almost $22 billion to the defense budget over the next four years is seen as vital to help secure the Royal Navy’s procurement plans. While we don’t yet know how many SSNR hulls are planned, other big-ticket shipbuilding programs include eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates, work on which is already underway, plus five new Type 32 frigates, up to six Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), and ultimately a new class of Type 83 destroyer. These are in addition to three Fleet Solid Support ships needed to support the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and a Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance Ship. Costlier than any of those programs is another submarine-building effort, with four new Dreadnought class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) planned to replace a similar number of Vanguard class boats that entered service in the 1990s. To be armed with Trident missiles, for which an increased stockpile of warheads is to be made available, the Dreadnought class is expected to enter service from the early 2030s and the program will have a total estimated cost of around $43 billion. The United Kingdom’s SSBN fleet represents the country’s sole nuclear deterrent and is of the utmost strategic imperative. A computer-generated artwork of a concept for the Dreadnought class SSBN. , BAE Systems Whichever way you look at it, the United Kingdom is investing in its maritime capabilities in a big way, and this is at a time when defense budgets are being stretched, with other major programs, most notably the F-35B Lightning stealth fighter , under threat of cuts. With that in mind, a scaling down of the final SSNR ambitions, or total hull numbers, should not be ruled out. On the other hand, the U.K. has long prided itself in its homegrown submarine-building capacity and underwater capabilities are unlikely to be given up lightly at a time in which both China and Russia are presenting ever more powerful adversaries in this domain. At the same time, Australia’s search for an SSN could mean that Britain, for the first time, seeks to sell a nuclear-powered submarine design to one of its allies, too. In so doing, it could help spread the cost burden of what will undoubtedly be a very expensive undertaking.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Australian government says it will buy U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles for the Royal Australian Navy, which it will integrate onto its Hobart class destroyers. The announcement of the planned purchase of these long-range strike weapons comes as Australia works to bolster its military capabilities, especially in the maritime domain , in the face of an increasingly powerful China. This also comes just a day after the country revealed it was embarking on a program to acquire nuclear-powered submarines in cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom, a major decision that you can read about more in The War Zone ’s initial reporting here . Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed this planned missile purchase, as well as expected orders for AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range ( JASSM-ER ) air-launched cruise missiles for the Royal Australian Air Force, this morning. Yesterday, Morrison, together with U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, announced a new trilateral defense cooperation pact , simply dubbed Australia-United Kingdom-United States, or AUKUS. That initiative includes plans for increased cooperation on the development and fielding of new long-range strike capabilities , as well as the nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), among other things. A Royal Australian Air Force F-35A Lightning conducts a flypast over HMAS Hobart during Exercise TASMAN SHIELD 21, off the east coast of Australia. Both these platforms are now set to receive new long-range strike missiles., Australian Department of Defense “I’m announcing, in addition to the acquisitions announced as part of the 2024 structure plan, that we will be enhancing our long-range strike capability, including Tomahawk cruise missiles to be fielded on the Royal Australian Navy Hobart class destroyers, and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (Extended Range) for our Royal Australian Air Force capabilities,” Morrison declared. The Royal Australian Navy has three Hobart class destroyers, which it received between 2017 and 2020. These 7,000-ton-displacement warships are of a very modern design and are presently optimized primarily for air defense duties. The addition of Tomahawks would provide these vessels with powerful new long-range land-attack and maritime strike capabilities, increasing their ability to project naval power, in general, over considerable distances. This would also give Australia a new anti-access/area-denial deterrent it could deploy in response to more specific challenges to its national security interests from potential opponents, such as China. The stealthy JASSM-ERs will similarly expand the Royal Australian Air Force’s ability to prosecute targets at extended ranges. According to official announcements, these missiles will be integrated on both Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18A/B Hornet and F-35A Lighting II fighter jets. The actual prospects for the addition of these missiles onto the Legacy Hornets seem extremely slim, and the F/A-18F Super Hornet would seem to be a more likely candidate, given the plan to retire the last of the A/B aircraft by the end of this year . Beyond these fighters, the JASSM-ER could potentially arm the RAAF P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft , too. Tomahawk and JASSM-ER are the latest in a line of advanced missiles that Australia is seeking to field. The original Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) is already used by the RAAF. Previously, Canberra also announced plans to acquire the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), which is derived from the JASSM-ER. It’s working with the United States on hypersonic missiles, too, including collaboration on the U.S. Army’s Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) program and the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment , or SCIFiRE, as well. With regards to the Tomahawks, though the plan is to field them initially on the Hobart class destroyers, these missiles could also be relevant to Australia’s new nuclear submarine plans. Modern submarines, in general, are inherently highly survivable launch platforms for long-range strike weapons. Nuclear-powered types offer considerable additional advantages in range, dive time, speed, and overall endurance compared to even advanced conventionally powered designs with air-independent propulsion systems . “Nuclear submarines have clear advantages,” Prime Minister Morrison had explained. “Greater endurance, they’re faster, they have greater power, greater stealth, more carrying capacity. These make nuclear submarines the desired substantial capability enhancement that Australia has needed. It helps us to build regional resilience.” Only two countries presently have TLAMs in inventory, the United States and the United Kingdom, and, in both cases, nuclear-powered submarines are an important launch platform for these weapons. Australia looks set to become the third operator of the missile and integrating them onto its future nuclear submarines, in addition to the Hobart class destroyers, would make perfect sense. It is also worth noting that Canada, too, has expressed an interest in acquiring the missiles for its forthcoming frigates . Tomahawks or not, the Royal Australian Navy is set to get a major boost in capabilities from the addition of a nuclear submarine force. Beyond what we already learned yesterday , we now also have confirmation that Australia plans to acquire at least eight of these boats. The plan is to build them locally in Adelaide with direct support from the United States and the United Kingdom through the AUKUS defense agreement. The timeline for the new submarines includes an 18-month period in which the U.K. and U.S. governments will help Australia explore the “optimal pathway” toward acquiring the new boats. So far, it’s not been determined whether the new SSNs will be a version of the British Astute class , the U.S. Virginia class or the forthcoming SSN(X) , or if they will emerge as something altogether different. The first of the new nuclear submarines are then expected to arrive within 10 years, but until then, the Royal Australian Navy will still operate its Collins class submarines, which will continue to undergo their life-extension program , ensuring they remain viable into the late 2040s. The first of these boats to be modernized will be HMAS Farncomb , in 2026. As widely expected, this new submarine plan also spells the end of the troubled program to procure 12 Attack class conventionally powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy under the SEA 1000 contract with France’s Naval Group. The program, which includes the production of 12 submarines, had increased from $40 billion to nearly $70 billion. The move was met with predictable dismay from France, including a joint statement from Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, and Florence Parly, the French Minister of Defense, which took particular aim at Washington, for its role in the collapse of the deal: “The American choice which leads to the removal of an ally and a European partner such as France from a structuring partnership with Australia, at a time when we are facing unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region (…) marks an absence of coherence that France can only observe and regret.” Meanwhile, in their own statement, the Naval Group insisted the Attack class was “a regionally superior conventional submarine with exceptional performance,” adding that it was “offering Australia a sovereign submarine capability making unrivaled commitments in terms of technology transfer, job, and local content.” “Contractual gates were built into the Attack class project, necessarily,” Prime Minister Morrison explained. “Decisions have to be made before you proceed through those gates, and so, as we were looking towards that next gate, we have decided not to enter through it as part of the Attack class program but instead now to pursue this path which gives us a far greater capability to meet the strategic needs.” All in all, despite no reference to China by officials, Australia is clearly seeking to counter Beijing’s growing military influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, as well as long-range missiles, points squarely to increasingly potential Chinese maritime threats , especially in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . Tellingly, the Australian move has already led to criticism from China: “Our world is becoming more complex, especially here in our region, the Indo-Pacific,” Morrison said, again without mentioning China by name. “This affects us all. The future of the Indo-Pacific will impact all our futures.” So, Australia’s decision to become one of only a handful of operators of nuclear-powered submarines does stand out, but it is also part of a much broader investment in expanding the country’s maritime capabilities. Those boats, as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles, are just some of the new tools the country, together with its closest allies the United States and the United Kingdom, is pursuing to bolster its ability to meet its national security needs in an increasingly contested Asia-Pacific region and match Beijing’s ambitions in this strategically vital part of the world.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",Behold F-117s On Their Historic Deployment To Fresno In These Stunning Shots,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We were first to report on the arrival of F-117s at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport in California and to get confirmation that they were there to train against resident F-15C/Ds from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing in an aggressor role . Now we are seeing amazing images coming from the historic deployment. This includes stunning captures from aviation photographers, as well as content from the 144th Fighter Wing itself, which marks a new disclosure paradigm for the officially retired F-117’s second shot at life. The message couldn’t be more clear: the jet is slowly stepping back out of the shadows after years of very shy operations . The incredible image at the top of this article comes from Fred Taleghani, who goes by @cvvhrn on Twitter. He was among a handful of aviation photographers who made a special trip to Fresno to capture the F-117s in action at the relatively quaint public airfield. The results were stunning: Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn Amazing details of all the fluid marks and intricate saw-tooth and diamond-shaped low-observable edges and apertures that adorn up the belly of the F-117. You can clearly see the downward-looking infrared (DLIR) turret, covered by a fine mesh screen, to the upper left of the nose landing gear. I wonder if it is even operational anymore. I doubt it. , Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn This F-117 still wears bomb/mission markings, as well as a pilot’s callsign “Cap.” You can also see the round backside of the forward-looking infrared turret. , Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn Neither of the jets seen at Fresno-Yosemite International Airport wore radar reflectors, which means air traffic control could not follow them easily on radar. They likely got around this by flying with F-15s during terminal operations. , Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn Both wear the TR tail code for Tonopah Test Range Airport, where the jets live now and where they were born into an operation state many decades ago., Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn The F-117’s communications antennas are deployed, allowing them to talk with the outside world. It also makes their radar signature a bit larger from certain perspectives. , Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn The F-117 looks like a remarkably large aircraft from this point of view considering the F-15 is called “the flying tennis court!” Note, one of the F-15s is carrying an electronic warfare training pod., Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn F-15s and an F-117 enter the overhead break., Fred Taleghani-@cvvhrn Fred’s shots are absolutely stunning, but the Air Force has now finally gotten in on the act, too. The 144th Fighter Wing posted two videos showing the F-117s operating out of the airfield, although as of yesterday morning they told us they still had not been cleared to do an actual story on the highly unique training deployment. Apparently, that has since changed. Beyond the videos posted above, the story and photos below were posted of the Pentagon’s media aggregation site DVIDS. It is the first official organic story about the F-117’s operations since the aircraft was retired in 2008: The 144th Fighter Wing welcomed the arrival of two F-117 Nighthawk aircraft Sept 13, 2021 to the Fresno Air National Guard Base, California, to conduct dissimilar air combat training missions. U.S. Air Force Col. Troy Havener, 144th Fighter Wing commander, said, “We have the distinct honor of being the first Air Force unit to host them for a full week of training,” referencing the Wing’s deliberate partnership building efforts and their demonstrated operational proficiency as critical to securing the training opportunity. Over the next few days the 144th FW’s F-15 pilots will conduct multiple dissimilar air combat training missions with the F-117 pilots. “This week we reap the benefits of two plus years of careful communication and determined coordination with agencies and leaders overseeing these unique USAF assets,” said Havener. “The training against integrated forces that include the F-117 will challenge and sharpen pilots, as well as build confidence in tactics and systems needed to defend our nation.” Lt. Col. David Allamandola, 144th FW Advanced Programs Officer said, “Our Griffin pilots, operations, and maintainers, are thrilled to be able to participate in this unique opportunity. It is a very special privilege to do open air training missions with the F-117 Nighthawks.” “This training offers incredible value for everyone involved and presents new challenges to test difficult tactics in a realistic environment. Not everyone gets to do this, so it’s been exciting creating the ground work with our partners to make this a reality,” said Allamandola. “The enthusiasm is contagious. We are incredibly thankful to our guests for their tireless efforts over an extended period of time to make this a reality. It’s been fantastic to see this plan come together.” This is the first time that F-117 Nighthawks have landed in Fresno. Their presence immediately received interest from multiple media outlets and some members of the community. Although officially retired, many F-117s remain airworthy and are used to support limited research and training missions based on overall cost effectiveness and their ability to offer unique capabilities. As of January 2021, the U.S. Air Force has 48 F-117s remaining in its inventory, and is disposing of approximately four aircraft each year. As airframes are disposed, they are offered to museums though the USAF Strategic Basing program and the National Museum of the USAF. Yesterday, Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek had also confirmed directly to The War Zone that “we are using the [F-117] aircraft for training as well as research.” Previously, the service had only officially acknowledged that it was employing flyable Nighthawks for research purposes. Stefanek also said that “the aircraft are being flown by Air Force Test Center personnel,” something that the Air Force has disclosed before. Here are the photos from the 144th Fighter Wing: Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez The photos show one interesting thing. On one of the F-117s, shown in the video, the aircraft carries nothing in one weapons bay and a standard travel pod in the other. The other F-117, seen below, carries a different contraption. I believe I have seen this before. I can’t say for sure, but I think these were built for moving golf clubs during away trips. They are yet another wacky facet of the F-117’s intriguing history. The other bay may hold a golf bag still in one of these things, or some other larger pod. We can’t tell from the photo. You can see the large dark object on the bay on the right and what we believe to be a golf club hauler on the left. , Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez Meanwhile, other F-117s have been busy too. A pair was recorded last night on a mission near Area 51 in Nevada, doing some test point work there, likely with the DYCOMS radar cross-section measurement facility. We have heard of these operations plenty of times before . But in this case, one of the F-117’s lost an engine and made an emergency landing back at Tonopah Test Range airport with only one of its F404 turbofans producing power. You can listen to the recording courtesy of our friends at Dreamlandresort.com by clicking here. Nobody has covered the F-117’s new lease on life like The War Zone has. We can confidently say that such open discussion about the use of the F-117’s post-retirement on an official level is unprecedented and it is truly good to see, but we have to wonder why it took so long? It really seems like it is time for the USAF to really open up about the F-117’s renaissance. The secrecy surrounding the program is almost laughable at this point. Like pretty much any tactical aircraft program, there are surely aspects of it that need to remain confidential, but considering these jets were flying at airshows for nearly 20 years before being retired, treating them as some sort of hush-hush asset draws more attention than just being open about them. Clearly, there is a very interesting story to tell here about how the “Dark Knights” came to be and who made it happen. Although this latest post mentioning their adversary training mission is encouraging, why not expand on that and celebrate the jet’s amazing legacy and the folks who keep them in the air? For now, at least we can bask in the glow of these amazing images, snapped some 13 years after the F-117 program officially called it quits.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 17, 2021",Australian Navy Goes Nuclear With Future Submarine Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Royal Australian Navy is set to get a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines as part of a new trilateral advanced defense agreement with the United States and the United Kingdom. The Australian government is also reportedly poised to cancel its long-troubled deal with French shipbuilder Naval Group to build advanced conventionally-powered attack submarines for the Royal Australian Navy as a result. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who was joined remotely by U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, made the announcement on Sept. 15, 2021. Morrison said that the plan, which will be refined over the next 18 months, is to build an unspecified number of nuclear-powered submarines in the Australian city of Adelaide in close cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom. An artist’s conception of an Attack class submarine for the Royal Australian Navy., Naval Group This effort is just one part of a new partnership between the three countries, dubbed AUKUS, which is short for Australia-United Kingdom-United States, that also includes cooperation in other areas, including long-range strike capabilities , cyber warfare, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing . President Biden said AUKUS would help all three countries work more closely together to help ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region in the long-term. Australia had previously considered acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine type to replace its aging Collins class diesel-electric boats, before deciding to pursue an advanced conventionally-powered design instead. In 2016, Naval Group, then known as DCNS, won the competition to supply the Collin class replacement with its Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A , which was derived from the company’s nuclear-powered Barracuda design that it developed for the French Navy. Since then, cost increases, delays, and other issues have dogged work on these submarines, the first of which the Royal Australian Navy announced would be named HMAS Attack in 2018. Under this existing deal, the first Attack class boats have not been expected to enter service until sometime in the early 2030s. The total cost of the program, which includes the production of 12 submarines, has also risen from $40 billion to nearly $70 billion. At the same time, the French government has continued to insist that its own effort to acquire six nuclear-powered Barracudas will only cost just over $10 billion, something that has only raised further questions about the state of the Australian contract with Naval Group. In June, Australia’s defense ministry announced plans to upgrade its existing Collins class submarines due to the issues with the Attack class. In January, there were reports that Australian authorities had also begun exploring alternative replacement options to the French-designed submarines. It would seem clear that the Attack class contract will now be scrapped in favor of these new nuclear-powered submarines. Four Royal Australian Navy Collins class submarines., Australian Department of Defense A nuclear-powered submarine, potentially one with land-attack strike capabilities, would significantly boost the Royal Australian Navy’s ability to conduct various kinds of undersea warfare operations in the future. While advanced conventional designs , such as the Shortfin Barracuda with its air-independent propulsion system , offer some similar performance aspects to nuclear propulsion, they cannot match the effectively unlimited range that nuclear propulsion provides. Nuclear-powered boats are faster and capable of staying submerged for time spans only limited to onboard provisions and maintenance demands, too. Even the most advanced AIP boat, such as ones that use fuel cell technology, still have to surface from time to time, including to refuel. This can be measured in weeks or less depending on how much energy is required during dive operations. All of this would be extremely beneficial for conducting patrols across the vast expanses of the Pacific, and for helping the boats get to their patrol locations faster. For instance, a 2013 report from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a U.S. think tank, indicated that nuclear-powered submarines operating from Perth could stay on station in the highly strategic South China Sea for up to 77 days, while advanced conventional submarines would only be able to manage patrol lasting around 11 days. These capabilities also mean nuclear-powered boats are even better able to perform roles where modern submarines, in general, already excel, including being highly survivable anti-ship and anti-submarine warfare, special operations, long-range strike, and intelligence gathering platforms . The Attack class submarines were expected to be armed with a mixture of heavyweight torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles , as well as being able to deploy naval mines. There had also been discussions about potentially adding a land-attack capability of some kind. So far, there have been no specific details about what a future Royal Australian Navy nuclear-powered submarine might look like. However, the Australian Financial Review newspaper did report that the United Kingdom could be directly involved in helping Australia to establish a domestic capability to build suitable nuclear reactors and that U.S. Navy might begin operating multi-purpose Virginia class boats from the HMAS Stirling naval base in Perth in the interim. Establishing the infrastructure and procedures necessary to support the Virginias would help pave the way for Australia’s own nuclear submarine force. It could also provide added opportunities for Royal Australian Navy personnel to conduct exchanges to gain more insight into operating boats with nuclear propulsion. It is also worth noting that the Virginia class is a nuclear-powered design in-production in the United States that could present a highly attractive off-the-shelf option for meeting Australia’s requirements. Astute class nuclear-powered submarines are also in production in the United Kingdom. Either type could also provide a starting place for a new type specifically for Australia, though using an existing design would help drive down procurement and sustainment costs for all parties involved. The US Navy’s Virginia class submarine USS Indiana ., General Dynamics Electric Boat Regardless, an Australian nuclear-powered submarine force is well in line with AUKUS’ overall emphasis on helping Australia, together with the United States and the United Kingdom , project power to an even greater degree in the Indo-Pacific, something that can only help challenge China’s increasing naval and other military capabilities. The Chinese government has ever-more-steadily employed its growing military prowess, as well as paramilitary forces, to assert its expansive and widely disputed territorial claims in the Pacific region, especially in the South China Sea . Growing Chinese military capabilities, as well as other tensions between Canberra and Beijing , have already been driving an increase in Australian defense spending, in general. This is a geopolitical reality this is significantly different from how things were when Naval Group was chosen to supply the country’s next submarines. The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) anti-submarine warfare capabilities have also continued to improve in the intervening years. At the same time, while the practical benefits of Australia pursuing a nuclear-powered submarine might be clear, doing so can only have a number of political ramifications for the country, both internationally and domestically. Most importantly, historically, nuclear reactors for submarines , due to their need to be compact, but powerful, have often been fueled by weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU). To date, there is no country that fields nuclear-powered submarines that does not also have nuclear weapons. Australia ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which includes a pledge by non-nuclear weapon states not to develop such a capability in any way, in 1973. The country also has a prohibition on building nuclear power plants in place. Australian Prime Minister Morrison insisted that the nuclear submarine plan would not violate the civil nuclear power prohibition and stressed that the country has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons. Separately, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the plan was fully in line with each country’s NPT obligations. The Astute class HMS Audacious . , BAE Systems Still, the infrastructure necessary for the local production, or just sustainment, of nuclear reactors for Royal Australian Navy submarines would undoubtedly cause significant debate about whether the country is meeting its obligations under the NPT or its own laws. It will almost certainly also prompt criticism from domestic groups, as well as foreign opponents, such as China. No matter what, the AUKUS announcement today makes clear that the current government in Australia, with the support of its allies, strongly feels that its national security needs now demand this kind of capability.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force C-130J Hercules airlifter landed on and then took off from a four-lane highway in rural Wyoming recently in the latest roadway landing exercise to take place in the United States. The maneuvers, which follow a previous drill conducted on a strip of Michigan highway last month, involving A-10 Warthog attack jets and C-146 Wolfhound special operations transports, reflect the service’s renewed interest in ways to operate in high-threat environments where access to conventional runways may be impossible , or at least greatly reduced. The C-130J highway landing was part of the Air Force Reserve Command’s larger, week-long Rally in the Rockies exercise and took place on U.S. Route 287, north of Rawlins, Wyoming, for around three hours on the early morning of September 13, 2021. This required the public road to be closed off by the Wyoming Department of Transportation to allow safe operations by the four-turboprop transport, while the local surroundings stood in for enemy territory. Once safely on the ground, the Hercules was used for a simulated personnel recovery mission — locating and recovering soldiers isolated from friendly forces. The historic landing of an Air Force Reserve C-130J on Highway 287, Rawlins, Wyoming, on September 13, 2021. , U.S. Air National Guard/Jacqueline Marshall The roadway scenario was just one of many during Rally in the Rockies, which came to an end today, September 16. The maneuvers took place in Colorado and Wyoming and involved more than a dozen Air Force units from the Reserve and Air National Guard. Led by the 913th Airlift Group from Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, which served as the exercise planning agency, different units undertook missions including cargo drops, high-altitude paratrooper drops, and delivery of artillery. They also resupplied task forces on the ground and conducted personnel extraction. On this occasion, it is notable that A-10s were again involved, apparently providing top cover for the C-130J while it conducted its personnel recovery mission An Air Force Reserve C-130J comes in for a landing on a four-lane highway in Wyoming on September 13, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Maj. Ashley Walker The overarching scenario emphasized operations in contested environments of the kind that would be encountered during a conflict with a peer or near-peer adversary. In these kinds of campaigns, Reserve and Guard units would be expected to operate seamlessly alongside their active-duty counterparts as a vital contributor to ensure ‘strategic depth’ — enough aircraft, where required, to meet combat commanders’ demands. “The Rally in the Rockies exercise ensures the Air Force Reserve and National Guard can provide an instantaneous surge capacity across most mission sets to strengthen our active-duty counterparts,” explained Major Nick Hainsfurther, a pilot with the 913th Operations Support Squadron and lead exercise planner. Above all, the exercise playbook envisaged that access to normal runways would be strictly limited. An Air Force Reserve C-130J reverses down the highway in Wyoming on September 13, 2021. , U.S. Air Force/Maj. Ashley Walker U.S. Air Force/Maj. Ashley Walker “In order to effectively accomplish combat operations, current scenarios assume traditional bases will be immediately threatened,” stated an Air Force press release about the exercise. As well as delivering troops or cargo, or extracting personnel from contested environments, missions also called for refueling and re-arming aircraft in austere locations, with little in the way of support infrastructure. This is a prerequisite for any kind of sustained air operations and a scenario that the Air Force has been increasingly putting to the test of late, with exercises in Europe and the Pacific theaters. “Our efforts will prepare Reserve and National Guard units to execute at the speed and range required to take on near-peer adversaries,” added Major Christopher Acs, a 327th Airlift Squadron pilot and also an exercise planner. U.S. Air National Guard/Jacqueline Marshall The Air Force Reserve Command C-130J takes off from the highway in Wyoming., U.S. Air Force/Maj. Ashley Walker While operating from highway strips is commonplace for several air forces around the world, road-operations drills are very much coming back into vogue within the U.S. military. Ultimately, not only would C-130s be expected to fulfill their wartime missions independent of established airbases, but an increased emphasis on dispersed operations for all tactical air assets would likely be the order of the day in any future peer or near-peer conflict. The Air Force C-130 community, as a whole, already has considerable experience of austere operations, as a part of regular exercises and during combat missions, including in Afghanistan and across the Middle East. Distinguished visitors, military members, and Wyoming leadership await the landing of an Air Force Reserve C-130J on Highway 287., U.S. Air National Guard/Jacqueline Marshall An Air Force Reserve C-130J is escorted by two A-10s flying 500 feet from each wingtip as it approaches the highway in Rawlins., U.S. Air National Guard/Jacqueline Marshall While it might take some time to prepare a section of highway to receive aircraft, especially ones as large as the C-130J, with a wingspan exceeding 132 feet, removing crash barriers, signs, and other obstacles, the inherent rough-field capability of the Hercules means that, in a combat environment, there would likely be plenty of other possible landing zones. For now, however, these types of missions are being practiced on U.S. highways and, significantly, are also involving Reserve forces. When Air Force A-10s and C-146s operated from Michigan State Highway M-32 near Alpena during Exercise Northern Strike last month, the Air Force said it was “the first time in history that the Air Force has purposely landed modern aircraft on a civilian roadway in the U.S.” Now, it’s the C-130’s turn and these aircraft would have a vital role to play in supporting A-10s, or other tactical jets operating from dispersed airstrips, bringing in maintenance personnel and flight-line equipment, as well as the fuel and munitions necessary to sustain the flight for any meaningful length of time. Setting up forward arming and refueling points (FARPs) for tactical fighters is something that Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) has used its MC-130J Commando II special operations tankers for in past exercises, as have HC-130J Combat King IIs , but a similar job can also be done by standard C-130Js . An earlier forward arming and refueling point exercise involving an MC-130J and F-22 fighters: By having C-130Js deliver fuel, weapons, and other items of kit to austere airstrips, tactical jets would not only be more survivable but also be able to get closer to the frontlines, or to wherever they were most needed, and can keep moving to remain one step ahead of the enemy. This is the kind of thinking that has informed the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment and Dynamic Wing concepts, which seek to move operations to austere locations with limited infrastructure and personnel. An A-10 orbits above the C-130J as it reverses down the highway., U.S. Air Force/Maj. Ashley Walker Having a Reserve-operated C-130J operate from a closed-off portion of U.S. highway might still be a rare occurrence but it speaks to the Air Force’s vision of future warfare in which established airbases could be destroyed, or at least rendered inoperable, were a major conflict to break out in Europe or the Pacific. With this new high-threat reality now seemingly a centerpiece of air warfare planning, it’s likely we will see more C-130s, and other aircraft too, training for the high-end fight with the help of the U.S. highway network.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 21, 2021",F-22 Export Briefing Shows What It Would Have Taken To Sell The Raptor Abroad,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The story of Lockheed’s F-22A Raptor stealth fighter has been and remains contentious in many ways, especially with regards to the short-sighted decision to curtail its production run and debates over whether or not to start building them again . The matter of exporting the jets still stirs strong opinions more than a decade after Congress made it impossible to do so for fear of the secrets of the aircraft’s many sensitive components and capabilities leaking out. However, lawmakers did also ask the U.S. Air Force to look into exactly what it might take to make an export version of the F-22, and The War Zone has now obtained a declassified copy of a detailed briefing into just what that study found. The Air Force released a heavily redacted, though still extremely insightful copy of this briefing, which is titled “F-22 Export Configuration Study” and is dated March 2010, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The War Zone had sought this document, which says the full unredacted version includes information that is still tightly controlled under multiple Special Access Programs (SAP), after noticing it among the references included in an unclassified report that the service sent to Congress about restarting F-22 production in 2017. You can read more about that more recent study here . The very last F-22 Raptor stealth fighter to be produced rolls off the production line in December 2011., Lockheed Martin The Special Programs Division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition led the work on the export study. The Global Power Division of that same office, as well as the Regional Affairs Division of the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs, also supported the effort. The 478th Aeronautical Systems Wing, which served as the F-22 System Program Office (SPO), as well as the Air Force’s Office of Operational Capability Requirements and Air Combat Command’s (ACC) 5th Generation Fighter Division, participated, as well. The complete group responsible for the study also included personnel from an Air Force Red Team, as well as the Air Force Office of Special Investigation’s (AFOSI) Region 7. The Air Force had been required to conduct this study into the feasibility of an export-configured F-22 through a provision in the “SAP Annex of the 2009 Appropriations Bill,” according to the briefing. The document also says that service requested and got approval from the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Defense for more time to complete this report, work on which only started in December 2009. The Air Force had already conducted one F-22 export study, together with Lockheed Martin, in 1998, and a Red Team from the service had also reexamined security concerns around transfers of sensitive technologies associated with the Raptor in 2006. Lockheed Martin had carried out its own internal export feasibility review in March 2009, as well. An excerpt of the requirement from Congress for an F-22 export study from the 2010 briefing. The Air Force added the highlighting., USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA In April 2009, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had announced his fateful intention to dramatically curtail F-22 purchases for the U.S. Air Force, something the service had acquiesced to in no small part to ensure continued funding would be available for what would become the B-21 Raider stealth bomber . Despite initial opposition, Congress agreed to the plan in July of that year in the face of a threat from President Barack Obama to veto any appropriations bill that included money for additional Raptors. In June 2009, Reuters had also reported that legislators were considering asking the service this new F-22 export study. This had apparently come up in response to one of the Japanese government’s many overtures over the years expressing interest in buying F-22s. Japan had inquired on multiple occasions about the possibility of acquiring Raptors, despite the passage of an amendment to another bill in 1998, put forward by David Obey, then a Democratic Representative from Wisconsin and Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which had blocked any potential exports of these jets. Israel and Australia had also shown robust interest in purchasing Raptors. All of this had an impact on the various ground rules and assumptions the group working on the study set as their starting point, as well as the potential courses of action they ultimately crafted. For instance, the study team outlined a notional export F-22 derived from the expected configuration, Increment 3.1, of the last Raptors on order for the Air Force. They also explored cost considerations based on the possibility that the production of jets for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers could immediately follow the service’s own final orders, as well as what might happen if the production line went cold for a time after the last of those aircraft were built. A slide from the F-22 export study briefing outlining the existing Increment 3.1 configuration., USAF via FOIA The study produced two core cost and schedule estimates for a notional F-22 FMS program. Option 1, which factored in a two-year pause in Raptor production, would cost approximately $11.6 billion, overall, including a production run of 40 aircraft, each with an average unit cost of $232.5 million. In today’s dollars, that would equate to an average unit cost of just under $259 million and a total cost of nearly $13 billion. Under this course of action, the Air Force estimated that the first FMS Raptor would be delivered around six and a half years after the award of a formal contract to begin developing the expert version of the jet. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA Option 2, with a total estimated cost of $8.3 billion, or around $9.2 billion in 2021 dollars, was based on the possibility of work on FMS F-22s beginning immediately after the end of production of the jets for the Air Force. The potential cost savings came from not needing to spend any more on restarting the Raptor line, as well as lower expected unit costs, only $165 million per jet, or close to $184 million in today’s dollars, which would have come from various efficiencies gained from continuous production. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA It is worth noting that neither option included any estimates about cost impacts from industrial or financial offsets on the part of any FMS customer or potential benefits in this regard to the U.S. government. Exporting F-22s would have helped push down procurement and operating costs for all countries flying versions of the jet. At the same time, they also did not factor in any additional costs associated with training or other support requirements that any American ally or partner would have had in standing up a Raptor force. Option 1 also assumed that Lockheed Martin would pause, not completely halt F-22 production, meaning that at least some elements of the production line would have remained in place, reducing the estimated costs associated with restarting work on the jets. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA Actually building the jets was a central issue in the study and the proposed 40-aircraft production run accounted, by far, for the largest chunk of the estimated costs under Options 1 and 2. However, just developing an exportable Raptor presented significant challenges. Unlike the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , which was also in development at this time, as well as previous non-stealth American fighter jet designs, the F-22 had not been designed with any consideration for export potential. The F-22 is packed full of sensitive technologies, from its low-observable structures and coatings , right down the fasteners that hold parts of the airframe together while helping it maintain its stealth capabilities. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA While there was export precedent in 2009 for some of the technologies found in the F-22 thanks to the F-35 program, the Raptor had at least three groups of systems and associated capabilities that the U.S. government had never allowed to go into a fighter destined for a foreign ally or partner. One of these technology groups included the Raptor’s advanced 2-D thrust vectoring and super-cruise capabilities, according to the briefing. What is included in the other two groups is entirely redacted, underscoring the sensitivity of those technologies, even now. Of course, details about many of the F-35’s critical technologies, which have been approved for export, are also blacked out. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA The notional export-configured F-22 that the study outlined actually leveraged some of the work being done on the F-35. This proposed FMS Raptor would notably have featured the Joint Strike Fighter’s AN/APG-81 active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar , rather than the original AN/APG-77, which is not found on any other aircraft. The AN/APG-81 was itself derived, in part, from the AN/APG-77. The export derivative of the Increment 3.1 F-22 would have needed some structural design to accommodate the AN/APG-81, among other things. The briefing also says that there would have been numerous changes, most of which are redacted, to the aircraft’s avionics, including “mission data files tailored per customer,” as well as to its low-observable (stealthy) features and coatings, what weapons it could carry, and associated support and training systems. USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA The Air Force did work with the assumption that there would be no local production in any way for the jets, which would be “end-item only,” again, something that is not the case with the F-35. “No software source code or software documentation will be exported,” the briefing adds. “Training and support will be provided under US controls to minimize the redesign required.” Training and other support for export F-22s did raise additional issues given how deeply integrated Lockheed Martin was, and still is, in the operation and sustainment of the Air Force’s Raptor fleet. When this export study was conducted, the service was paying, on average, approximately $3 million, or just over $3.75 million in today’s dollars, for Contractor Logistics Support per aircraft every year. That figure did not include overhauls to each jet’s two Pratt & Whitney F119 engines. USAF via FOIA In addition, the “USAF paradigm must change to provide ‘Operational Sovereignty’ to customer (i.e., no Lockheed Martin personnel in maintenance force that must deploy with units),” the briefing notes at one point. This is also interesting in the context of persistent questions about the actual extent of operational sovereignty when it comes to the F-35, particularly when it comes to the limitations imposed by the need for operators to use the associated cloud-based Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which you can read more about in detail here . To date, only one F-35 customer, Israel, has secured the ability to fly its jets entirely independent of the ALIS network, which is now slated to eventually be replaced by the Operational Data Integrated Network . USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA USAF via FOIA We don’t know how this study was received or what further discussions it might have prompted. It is clear that the decision was made not to act on it, with the prohibition on any foreign sales of the F-22 still in place today. After the last Raptor was delivered in 2012, the production line subsequently closed down and the tooling went into storage. The far-more-exportable F-35 remains in production and continues to find new customers abroad, something that was undoubtedly one of the many factors that led the U.S. government to pass on the possibility of an FMS Raptor. You can find a full copy of the F-22 export study here . There have been discussions since then about restarting the production line to make more jets for the Air Force, as well as potentially for export. The War Zone itself has touched on how the operational security concerns have likely diminished in the intervening years. The Air Force’s most recent serious look into rebooting F-22 production, at least that we know of now, came in 2017 when it reexamined the issue for Congress. That study estimated, at that time, it would cost $50.3 billion, or around $56 billion in 2021 dollars, to restart Raptor production and build 194 new aircraft. At the same time, every country that is known to have expressed interest in potentially buying F-22s – Japan , Israel , and Australia – has now purchased F-35s. There were reports in 2018 that Lockheed Martin had pitched a hybrid design of some kind that would have incorporated elements of the F-22 and the F-35 to Japan, but no further information about any such aircraft has since materialized. The U.S. Air Force itself is now actively planning for a future without the F-22, with its attention shifting to new manned and unmanned combat aircraft that it hopes to develop through its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. Advanced unmanned capabilities, in particular, have come to the forefront of planning for what future aerial combat will look like, not just throughout the U.S. military , but also elsewhere around the world . Beyond all that, it is important to remember that development of what became the F-22 began in the 1980s, before being refined in the 1990s. The Raptor has been in service for 16 years now and technology, as well as what is understood to be required for air supremacy in future conflicts, has continued to evolve. There are increasing premiums on range, payload capacity, and overall adaptability to multiple mission sets, none of which are the F-22’s strengths. All told, discussions about restarting Raptor production for any reason, especially for export, look to be increasingly moot. A maintainer from the 574th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron performs depot maintenance on F-22 Raptor at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, in 2018,, USAF After the Air Force finally retires its F-22 fleet there could be a possibility that one of America’s allies or partners might seek to buy them and return them to service. This, however, seems very remote, especially given the relatively small number of available Raptors, a total that has shrunk over the years due to accidents . The ever-growing costs and complexities associated with operating and maintaining these aircraft might also further dissuade any potential second-hand operator. Last year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that said it cost the U.S. Air Force, on average, around $14 million in 2018 dollars, or just over $15 million in today’s dollars, annually, per aircraft , to operate and maintain the F-22. The cost per flight hour to fly the Raptor is around $50,000. The U.S. government is much more likely to try to steer allies and partners toward the F-35, though some members of Congress are looking to put new restrictions on that, as well. At the same time, the 2010 export study could well be among the historical case studies the United States uses in considering the export potential of any future advanced aircraft. No matter what, these new details about what the Air Force thought it would take to create an F-22 derivative that could be more readily exported is another fascinating addition to the history of the Raptor.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has revealed that a pair of ballistic missiles it test-fired earlier today were launched using a previously unknown railway-based system. A railcar-based missile launcher would offer a relatively cheap way for the North Koreans to field additional missiles in a way that would make them significantly less vulnerable to preemptive or counter-attacks. The launches were carried out by the North Korean military’s Railway Mobile Missile Regiment and this was the unit’s first time demonstrating what was described only as a “railway mobile missile system,” according to an official release from the country’s state media. The statement also says the missiles flew approximately 800 kilometers, or nearly 500 miles, from their launch point before failing into the sea off the country’s eastern coastline. A group of pictures North Korean state media released of the rail-mobile missile tests today., North Korean state media “The Eighth Congress of the Party [held in January 2021] organized the Railway Mobile Missile Regiment to increase the capability for dealing [an] intensive blow to the menacing forces in many places at the same time during [the] necessary military operation and powerfully improve the ability to more actively cope with all sorts of threats as part of [the] establishment of [a] new defense strategy,” according to the state media release. “The drill was aimed at confirming the practicability of the railway mobile missile system deployed for the first time for action, evaluating without notice the combat preparedness of the new regiment and its ability to perform firepower mission and mastering the actual war procedures.” The launcher itself appears to be integrated inside a modified boxcar. The launcher arm, to which the missile is attached, moves into the launch position after the roof opens. Doors on the sides also open up to allow the blast from the missile’s rocket motors to vent out the sides. It is not entirely clear from the North Korean state media statement, or the pictures that were released along with it, what missile or missiles the railway mobile missile system is capable of firing. From what we can see in the photographs, the weapons launched in this particular test appear to be examples of a missile that the U.S. military refers to as the KN-23 , which is, at least externally, very similar-looking to the Russian Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile. North Korea has also previously tested what appears to be a scaled-up KN-23-derivative . The full montage of photographs North Korean state media released from the missile tests today., North Korean state media A picture North Korea released of a test of a KN-23 missile in 2019., North Korean state media A picture North Korea released of a test in March 2021 of what looks to be an enlarged derivative of the KN-23., North Korean state media It’s interesting to note that South Korean and Japanese authorities have assessed that the KN-23, as well as this other larger missile, has only ever flown out to between 261 miles and 280 miles in past tests. The North Koreans themselves only claimed that examples of this enlarged KN-23 derivative traveled a distance of around 373 miles during test launches in March. The claimed range of whatever these rail-mobile missiles are is substantially greater, which could indicate that these other missiles have longer ranges than have previously been demonstrated. “The railway mobile missile system is an effective counter striking means to deal a heavy blow at the threatening forces multiconcurrently with dispersive firing across the country,” Marshal Pak Jong Chon, a member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and Secretary of the Party Central Committee, who oversaw the tests, said, according to the statement. “He stressed the need for the army and the fields concerned to steadily perfect the tactical plans to make the best use of this system in accordance with the geographical conditions and realities of the country.” The final remark about the “geographical conditions and realities of the country” is particularly notable here. North Korea has extensive rail lines and experience in building specialized trains. This includes a special armored train that is used by the country’s leader Kim Jong Un and members of his inner circle. https://youtube.com/watch?v=nOb485wfio4 A rail-mobile missile force would, as Marshal Pak reportedly observed, give the North Korean regime additional ways to rapidly disperse weapons of this kind and do so in a way that could be challenging for opponents to detect and monitor. Rail tunnels throughout North Korea would effectively provide hardened bunkers for these mobile missile launchers to hide in and would further frustrate attempts by adversaries to track their movements, let alone destroy them. They could be rolled out, fired, and then rolled back in the tunnel or moved to another tunnel very rapidly, making them extremely hard to destroy. They could also be moved around in disguised cars among other normal rail cars making them almost impossible to spot for daily operations. North Korea is hardly the first country to see the potential value in a rail-mobile ballistic missile force for exactly these reasons. Russia, and the Soviet Union before it, previously deployed rail-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), known as the RT-23 Molodets . The Kremlin had also previously planned to reintroduce this capability, with a system called Barguzin , before canceling that project to focus on the Avangard hypersonic missile. During the Cold War, the United States also explored rail-mobile ICBMs on multiple occasions as one of many options to help reduce the vulnerability of its strategic missile forces. It is possible that North Korea’s new rail-mobile missile system might be adaptable to other weapons, as well, including other missiles that the country has in service or in development. Many of these weapons are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads . In addition, it is worth pointing out that this disclosure of yet another new North Korean missile system comes just days after it disclosed a test of a new ground-launched cruise missile . Earlier today, South Korea also released videos and details about the tests of four of its own new missiles , including a “high-power” ballistic missile and a supersonic cruise missile, underscoring a still-growing missile race that has emerged on the Korean Peninsula. Regardless, North Korea’s adoption of the rail-mobile missile system is hardly surprising and makes good sense for the country, especially given its existing infrastructure and technical expertise.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 26, 2021",Two NATO Fighters Accidentally Flew Behind The Iron Curtain 60 Years Ago Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sixty years ago today, during one of the tensest periods of the Cold War in Europe , a pair of West German jet fighter-bombers accidentally strayed into communist airspace in a simple error that could have had genuinely catastrophic results. After evading the dozens of MiGs sent to intercept them, the two Luftwaffe pilots safely landed in West Berlin. They would never fly on the front line again and efforts were made to cover up the embarrassing incident, one which might have even triggered World War III. Only a month after the Berlin Wall had been built, separating communist East Berlin from West Berlin, tensions were running high in Europe, including in the air over a divided Germany. Triggered by the construction of that wall, which had begun on August 13, the Berlin Crisis of 1961 emerged amid a major hike in Soviet defense expenditure and a resumption in nuclear testing . It led to U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s decision to deploy significant U.S. military reinforcements to Europe, including Air National Guard units, mostly flying F-84F Thunderstreak fighter-bombers, as well as around 100,000 ANG and Air Force Reserve personnel. A U.S. Air Force F-84F from the New Jersey Air National Guard at Chaumont Air Base, France, as part of Operation Stair Step, the U.S. response to the Berlin Crisis in 1961., U.S. Air Force It was against this backdrop that, on September 14, two other F-84Fs operated by the West German Luftwaffe’s Jagdbombergeschwader 32, or 32nd Fighter-Bomber Wing, took off from their airbase at Lechfeld in Bavaria, in southern Germany. The pilots, 23-year-old Feldwebel Peter Pfefferkorn and 27-year-old Stabsunteroffizier Hans Eberl, were to take part in a NATO exercise, Checkmate , in which they would play the role of enemy aircraft. Pfefferkorn had 580 flight hours on the F-84F, Eberl only 70. The mission called for the two Luftwaffe jets to head directly north, before turning to the west over the West German city of Würzburg. This would then put them on a heading for French airspace, which they were expected to penetrate and then continue toward Laon in France. In the process, they would be intercepted by other NATO assets, before returning south, in the direction of the French city of Strasbourg, and then heading back toward Memmingen, another Bavarian airbase. It was, according to a contemporary account from other Lechfeld aircrew “the simplest thing in the world.” To say things didn’t work out according to plan would be an understatement. In fact, it started to go wrong for the West German pilots as soon as they took off from Lechfeld at 1:49 PM local time. Navigation errors put them on the wrong heading and these problems were compounded by strong winds, which pushed them further north. This was not just a human failure, though, since a thunderstorm had affected the radio compasses on both jets, with the one on Pfefferkorn’s aircraft showing readings that were inaccurate by between 40 and 60 degrees. At one point, the Luftwaffe pilots mistook Liège in Belgium for Reims in France, the latter city actually being located around 120 miles to the southwest. Gathered for an earlier exercise, in 1959, NATO aircraft gather in front of the tower of Bitburg Air Base, West Germany. From front to back, they comprise a Canadair Sabre (nose only), a Luftwaffe F-84F Thunderstreak, a Royal Netherlands Air Force F-86K Sabre, a French Air Force Mystère IVA, a Royal Air Force Hawker Hunter, a Belgian Air Force CF-100, and a U.S. Air Force F-100C Super Sabre., U.S. Air Force Somewhere over Cologne in West Germany, the two pilots now made a turn toward the east. This, unbeknownst to them, put them right on course to cross the border into East Germany, and onto Berlin, via some of the most heavily defended airspace anywhere in the world. Around 3:00 PM local time, military radar picked up the two F-84Fs now near Warburg in West Germany and, soon after, air traffic controllers put out the call for NATO jets to scramble to meet the Luftwaffe aircraft, now clearly lost. It seems the pilots were unaware of the controllers’ concerns and were instead busy discussing the situation between themselves. “Where are we?” one reportedly asked . “Do you have the radio beacon?” Meanwhile, they continued on their eastward path. An August 1961 Newsweek map showing the occupation zones of Berlin., Newsweek Before long, the two Thunderstreaks had penetrated the Iron Curtain and were over the East German city of Leipzig, when Pfefferkorn, the flight lead, switched to the emergency radio frequency and made a Mayday call. However, the East Germans and their Soviet allies were already well aware of what had happened and had sent up interceptors to catch them soon after they penetrated communist airspace. Reportedly, no fewer than 42 fighter jets , consisting of various kinds of MiGs, had been scrambled from Soviet airbases in East Germany, but the F-84Fs were protected by a thick layer of clouds between 6,000 and 36,000 feet. Before the MiGs had a chance to catch the NATO jets, the intruders were over Berlin airspace, where the Four Powers (France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) exercised joint control of the airspace since the end of World War II. President Kennedy’s address on the U.S. and NATO response to the Berlin Crisis in 1961: While the American, British, and French allies all maintained airports in the enclave of West Berlin, these were off-limits to West German air traffic, military or otherwise, due to the Four Powers regulations governing the divided city. Not expecting West German combat jets to be over East German territory, the French air traffic controllers at Tegel Airport , in the French sector, assumed the Luftwaffe planes were lost civilian aircraft and suggested they land at Tempelhof, the U.S. airbase in Berlin. At Tempelhof, it seems the controllers were too busy with a Pan Am DC-6 airliner that was arriving from Frankfurt, that they failed to notice the Luftwaffe jets. However, once the presence of the lost fliers became clear, the Tempelhof controllers instead requested the Thunderstreaks land at Tegel. While the two pilots considered turning around and flying back to the West, the Tempelhof controllers were aware MiGs were now in pursuit and called for the F-84Fs to drop down low over Berlin, aiming for Tegel. A Pan Am Douglas DC-6B at Tempelhof Airport in 1964., Ralf Manteufel/Wikimedia Commons Not only did Tegel Airport have a much longer runway, but it was also less busy with other aircraft movements. Perhaps most importantly, it was further outside the city than the centrally located Tempelhof, making it less likely that the F-84Fs would be spotted. After all, as West German aircraft, they were prohibited from the airspace over Berlin. An East German riot control truck equipped with water cannons in front of the Brandenburg Gate, while the Berlin Wall was being constructed, in August 1961., Deutsches Bundesarchiv At 3:29 PM local time, the two Thunderstreaks touched down at Tegel in Berlin’s French sector. There then began a frantic effort to conceal the jets’ arrival, and they were quickly put in hangars. The French told the Soviet representative at the Allied air security center that the Tegel landing had been an emergency, the result of an unforeseen technical failure. Pfefferkorn and Eberl were undoubtedly lucky to survive unscathed. The shooting down of NATO aircraft that strayed across borders into Warsaw Pact airspace was by no means unusual at this time. In 1964, a similar incident, in which a U.S. Air Force T-39 Sabreliner training jet flew into East German airspace, ended with the American jet being shot down by a MiG , and its three crew were killed. Two years later, a similar fate befell a U.S. Air Force RB-66 Destroyer reconnaissance jet, although its crew survived.

Operation Stair Step involved the deployment of more than 200 fighter aircraft., U.S. Air Force As it was, Pfefferkorn and Eberl, and their two jets, had escaped the attentions of the Warsaw Pact air defenses but had nonetheless created an international incident. The West German government in Bonn issued an apology, describing the incident as the result of “human and technical failure” and pointing to the failure of the compass system in both the jets. The Soviets were still unhappy, making a formal protest against what they described as a “premeditated provocation” and threatening to shoot down NATO aircraft were it to happen again. This is a threat, as already noted, that they would follow through on. As for the F-84Fs, it was decided to leave them where they were. After they had been cannibalized for their engines and, ironically, their navigation systems, the jets were unceremoniously buried south of the runway at Tegel. A preserved Luftwaffe F-84F on display at a museum in Hermeskeil, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany., Paul Hermans/Wikimedia Commons The pilots, both of whom had been arrested by the French authorities on account of their unplanned Berlin visit, only returned home after nearly five weeks. Their mistake was to prove costly to their careers: both were demoted to ground crew roles. The situation for their commanding officer, Oberstleutnant Siegfried Barth, who had flown for Nazi Germany during World War II, was, initially at least, even worse off. He was relieved of his duties until West German Minister of Defense Franz Josef Strauss relented due to legal pressure and reinstated him. Not surprisingly, the implications of the incident caused concern in both East and West Germany. In the East, the fact that two NATO jets had flown as far as the capital without being stopped was alarming. For the West, there were questions at the highest levels as to how the F-84Fs had managed to penetrate so far into enemy airspace at a time of serious tensions, when it was known that it could have resulted in them being shot down or, worse still, convincing the East Germans and Soviets that they were under attack. As part of its response, the Luftwaffe declared that any subsequent such incursion of Warsaw Pact airspace would lead to the immediate dismissal of the responsible commander. In a conflict that was punctuated by close calls, and in which the expanding nuclear arsenals on both sides meant that the threat of annihilation was very real, the incident of September 14, 1961, is a reminder of just how high the stakes were.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 20, 2021",It Looks Like A C-130 Seaplane Is Finally Happening,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Back in May, we reported on the fact that U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) really wanted to make the long-standing dream of a C-130 seaplane a reality . In fact, the so-called MC-130J Amphibious Capability, or MAC, was listed as one of its new procurement priorities. While we had a grainy little rendering of what this could look like when we filed that report, as well as other historical design concepts, we now have a far better look at exactly what they want, and yes, it is a C-130 on floats. Actually, they have put forward a number of similar floatplane concepts, some more traditional looking while others are more streamlined, conformal, and futuristic looking. The capability appears to include the requirement for amphibious operations. In other words, the MC-130 can still land on a runway with the floats fitted. You can see the renderings AFSOC has posted throughout this article. Air Force Special Operations Command stated the following, which is pretty much what we summed up in May, in an official release dated September 14th, 2021: The C-130J is an incredibly versatile aircraft, and since its creation, it’s landed on rough fields, in arctic locations and even an aircraft carrier Yet, it cannot land on water, which covers about 71% of the planet. As national strategic objectives shift focus to littoral regions, Air Force Special Operations Command is advancing new approaches to expand the multi-mission platform’s runway independence and expeditionary capacity. In partnership with the Air Force Research Lab’s Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (AFRL-SDPE) directorate, AFSOC is developing an MC-130J Commando II Amphibious Capability (MAC) to improve the platform’s support of seaborne special operations. “The development of the MAC capability is the culmination of multiple lines of effort,” said Lt Col Josh Trantham, AFSOC Science, Systems, Technology, & Innovation (SST&I) Deputy Division Chief. “This capability allows the Air Force to increase placement and access for infiltration, exfiltration, and personnel recovery, as well as providing enhanced logistical capabilities for future competition and conflict.” AFSOC The development of a removable amphibious float modification for an MC-130J would enable “runway independent ” operations, which, according to Trantham, would extend the global reach and survivability of the aircraft and Air Commandos. “Seaborne operations offer nearly unlimited water landing zones providing significant flexibility for the Joint Force,” Trantham said. Utilizing the MAC capability may provide unlimited operational access to waterways to distribute forces if land assets are compromised. AFSOC There is no doubt about it, runway independence is becoming a huge issue within Pentagon as peer state adversaries, and even less-capable ones, put l arge fixed runways at risk over great distances, namely via the employment of ballistic missiles . As such, bringing C-130 might and flexibility to bear without needing a runway at all is becoming a very attractive proposition. Maj Kristen Cepak, AFSOC Technology Transition Branch Chief, states: “MAC is vital to future success because it will allow for the dispersal of assets within a Joint Operations Area… This diaspora complicates targeting of the aircraft by our adversaries and limits aircraft vulnerability at fixed locations.” AFSOC Right now there is a five-phase prototyping initiative underway that hopes to lead to an operational demonstration of the MAC concept in just 17 months. This is a very ambitious timeline that is aided by virtual modeling and other digital engineering concepts that are all the buzz right now within the Pentagon and especially the Air Force. Lockheed Martin has the benefit of conducted numerous design studies into exactly this kind of capability in the past, including at least one based on the C-130J variant as recently as the late 1990s, as well. Then, with much of the development work done and even tested, AFSOC could move really quickly into full acquisition mode to field a truly operational MAC and to potentially help deploy the concept on other C-130s (firefighting anyone?). Lt Col Josh Trantham explains: “We believe MAC will be able to be used by our sister services, allies, and partners on various C-130 platforms… Further, expanding the operational use of an amphibious aircraft alongside other innovative tools will provide even more complex dilemmas in future battlespaces for our strategic competitors.” AFSOC It’s amazing to think after nearly seven decades of C-130s , an aircraft that has been adapted to do so many disparate things, we may be on the precipice of finally getting one that can operate from water.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 18, 2021",Damaged B-2 Spirit Is Sitting Wing-Down Off The Runway After Landing Mishap,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We were first to report on a mishap that occurred in the early hours of Tuesday, September 14th, 2021, and involved one of just 20 B-2 Spirit stealth bombers in existence. The incident occurred after the stealth bomber had malfunctioned on a training flight and made an emergency landing at its home airfield—Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri—at around 12:40 AM local time. The aircraft was subsequently damaged upon touching down and restrictions were placed over airspace within six miles of the rural base. While we received an official comment that the incident did indeed occur and that the aircraft was damaged, the extent of the damage was not released. It now appears that the B-2 made a ‘runway excursion,’ ending up wing-down in the grass beside Whiteman’s only runway. It was to our understanding that the aircraft in question slid off the runway during its emergency recovery, although we had no confirmation of this until we received an image via Planet Labs showing Whiteman at around 10:30 AM local time on September 15th, 2021. As you can see, the aircraft appears to have exited the runway and came to a rest in the grass midfield. The stealth bomber’s intakes and exhausts have since been covered and there is clearly a recovery and investigation effort involving many people and vehicles underway. Location of the crash site., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The official statement we received after our initial inquiry about a possible crash stated: Thank you for the query. There has been an incident at Whiteman AFB. It occurred at approximately 12:30 a.m. on Sept. 14. A U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit experienced and [sic] in-flight malfunction during a routine training mission and was damaged on the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, after an emergency landing. There were no personnel injuries and no fire associated with the landing. The incident is under investigation and more information will be provided as it becomes available. According to sources, the B-2 experienced a hydraulic failure in flight and had its port main landing gear collapse during landing, sending it off the runway with its wing dug into the ground. We cannot confirm that this was the case at this time, but the satellite image above does concur with the gear collapse/wing down aspect of the incident. While it is possible the aircraft was rolled off the runway after the fact, this is unlikely, especially considering its wing-down disposition. The damage to the aircraft also remains unknown. A B-2 sitting in one of their purpose-built shelters at Whiteman AFB., STRATCOM The B-2’s highly intricate skin is made up of delicate radar-absorbent materials and some of its sub-surface structures are critical to its ability to attenuate radar waves . As such, the damage could be superficial to severe, we just do not know. Gear collapses can also cause major damage around where the gear is mounted and putting major loads on a wingtip during a ground impact can result in severe structural issues with the wing, which makes up nearly half of the flying wing-bomber. It could have been far worse. A catastrophic loss of flight data resulted in the write-off of one B-2 in 2008 during a deployment to Guam (seen above). Full of fuel during takeoff, the aircraft pitched up, floated down the runway, then violently rolled into the ground, erupting in a ball of fire. Both pilots got out thankfully, but the aircraft was a total loss. B-2s are made up of exotic composites and covered in exotic coatings, many of which are highly toxic as well as highly classified, making crash recovery operations challenging., Federal Aviation Administration The good news is that the aircraft looks intact and, as the USAF’s statement reads, there appears to have been no fire. As it sits right now, the temporary flight restriction is set to expire on Friday, so it’s likely the aircraft will be fully secured by then or moved to another location. Otherwise, we could see that flight restriction extended. We will continue to report back as new details becoming available on this developing story.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 7, 2021",South Korea Tests Four New Missiles After North Korean Launches,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has followed up last week’s reported test of a North Korean land-attack cruise missile by announcing a raft of new weapons of its own, including what it describes as a “high-power” ballistic missile able to carry a heavier warhead than previous weapons. Also revealed today was a supersonic anti-ship cruise missile, which has also been successfully tested, and which apparently features a ramjet propulsion system. These were just part of a flurry of new details about South Korean missile developments, also including a new air-launched long-range cruise missile, while Seoul’s previously disclosed submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) is now reported to have completed a full launch sequence. Official videos were released today showing South Korea’s new ballistic missile, anti-ship cruise missile, and air-launched cruise missile. The disclosure of these South Korean missiles, and the recently announced tests, are the latest in a series of weapons developments on the peninsula in recent weeks, including underwater ejection tests from the same submarine announced earlier this month. Successful testing of North Korea’s new land-attack cruise missile was announced two days ago, and you can read more about its implications here . Meanwhile, only hours before Seoul announced its new weapons, North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. Test launch of South Korea’s new ballistic missile., South Korean Ministry of Defense Of the new South Korean disclosures, one the most impressive is certainly a sequence showing the so-called “high-power” ballistic missile. This is seen being fired from a ground-based mobile launcher at a coastal test facility — likely the Anheung Proving Grounds on the country’s west coast — before slamming into a target, scoring a direct hit on a red flag in the center circle. The designation of the new missile has not been confirmed, but its appearance now tallies with earlier announcements regarding a ballistic missile that local media described (not accurately) as being “as powerful as a tactical nuclear weapon.” Missile experts including Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C., suggest the new missile is the Hyunmoo 4 short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), a previously reported type, but one that has not previously been seen. Meanwhile, South Korea’s recent budget proposal also includes a new ballistic missile capable of carrying a warhead weighing up to three tons, compared to the two tons for the Hyunmoo 4 short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), and with a range of between 220 and 250 miles (350 and 400 kilometers). According to reports, this new missile would be tailored to destroy hardened underground sites, including North Korea’s nuclear storage facilities, and may well be the missile revealed today, but that cannot be confirmed. South Korea’s Ministry of Defense also announced its new supersonic cruise missile today, with the country’s Agency for Defense Development confirming that the development of the weapon was completed late last year. “With improved speed, the new missile will make it very difficult for enemy warships to respond, leading to the missile’s higher survivability and destructive power,” a press release from South Korea’s Ministry of Defense explained. “It is expected to serve as a core asset to counter forces that approach our territorial waters.” Another video released by the Ministry of Defense shows South Korea’s new supersonic cruise missile also being launched from a coastal test site, then climbing to a certain height, before the focus then shifts to watching it impact a naval target. While no further details have been released regarding this missile, and its designation remains unknown, the weapon appears to have a similar configuration to the Russian Oniks/Yakhont anti-ship missile , and the Russian/Indian BrahMos that was developed from it. Oniks/Yakhont has an integrated ramjet engine fed by an annular air intake in the nose. The Russian weapon has a range of over 300 miles and can reach a maximum speed of Mach 2.8. Twitter Screencap South Korea has already amassed a wealth of experience in designing and developing cruise missiles, starting with the Haeseong (Sea Star) series of anti-ship missiles on which work began in the mid-1990s, primarily to counter North Korea’s considerable numbers of small- to medium-sized naval vessels. These weapons have been adapted for launch from surface warships and submarines, from road-mobile trucks, as well as from F-16 fighters. It’s unclear how the new cruise missile is expected to be employed. However, while previous South Korean anti-ship cruise missiles were turbojet-powered, it appears that the missile revealed today may employ ramjet propulsion, which should ensure it can fly considerably faster, making it harder for air defenses to defeat. Of the other announcements from Seoul today, the apparent end-to-end test of the country’s indigenous, conventionally armed SLBM from the submarine Dosan Ahn Chang-ho is less of a surprise. The War Zone has looked at this unique weapon and charted its development path in the past and a test of this kind had been widely anticipated. The missile has now completed an underwater test launch and, according to an official report, “flew a planned distance and precisely hit a target.” The fact that President Moon Jae-in was on hand to observe the latest SLBM test may well reflect the maturity of the weapon, which now might be expected to enter production and service relatively soon, based on previous reports. The other major new missile announcement involves a new long-range air-to-surface missile, which has entered flight test, including a successful separation test. Accompanying video shows the missile, which features pop-out wings, and an apparently stealthy, angular body, being launched from a Republic of Korea Air Force F-4E fighter jet, with an F-15K acting as a chase plane to observe the test. The new missile is said to be intended to arm the new-generation KF-21 fighter jet that’s currently under development, and which you can read more about here . ROK MoD-released footage of a recently tested new air-to-ground missile for ROKAF F-4/KF-21 fighters. Test discussed here: https://t.co/GFy1uYCV18 pic.twitter.com/uccDXyhfW6 — Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) September 15, 2021 Work on these South Korean ballistic missiles has no doubt been spurred by the lifting in May of bilateral guidelines that restricted the country’s development of weapons in this class. As a result, South Korea is no longer bound to successive range limits imposed under the agreement with the United States, which most recently limited a missile’s range to 500 miles. Ultimately, South Korea is now permitted to field missiles capable of reaching targets far beyond the Korean Peninsula, although the North clearly remains the focus of its attention. Nevertheless, some of these weapons, especially the supersonic cruise missile, could have broader regional significance and could contribute to South Korea’s ambitions to field a far more capable navy with greater reach and featuring aircraft carriers and improved submarines , in particular. In the shorter term, however, for South Korea, these new missiles reflect an increased defense budget as well as the continuing effort to achieve greater military independence, rather than having to rely on the United States should it go to war with the North . “The increase in our missile power can be a sure deterrent against North Korean provocations,” President Moon said in a statement today. Overall, however, while such weapons would clearly be useful in a war against North Korea, they also present a more general challenge to any opponent. While South Korea does not have a nuclear capability, a wider range of long-range missile delivery systems provides more options should war break out on the peninsula, with North Korea, in turn, having to defend its strategic installations against different types of weapons with varying flight profiles. At the same time, of course, North Korea is continuing to bolster its missile armory, with increasingly long-ranged ballistic missiles now apparently set to be complemented by nuclear-capable long-range cruise missiles , too. Two views showing the as yet unidentified new North Korean long-range cruise missile that appeared earlier this week., NORTH KOREAN STATE MEDIA Moreover, the timing of the South Korean announcements, and Pyongyang’s latest missile test, could also be related to the meetings between high-level officials in the region to discuss the stalled nuclear talks regarding North Korea. Those negotiations collapsed in 2019 during the U.S.-North Korea summit in Vietnam, after which Pyongyang has only ramped up its development of nuclear delivery systems and, apparently, its plutonium-production capacity, too. This week, President Biden’s nuclear envoy, Sung Kim, is in Japan for talks with Japanese and South Korean officials, while the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in Seoul to discuss the nuclear issue. While the Biden administration has signaled to Pyongyang that it’s willing to return to negotiations and lift at least some sanctions as part of a nuclear deal, North Korea has so far remained resistant to these overtures. As well as continuing work on these weapons, North Korea has repeatedly criticized military developments in South Korea, and its joint exercises with the United States. In the wake of today’s announcements from the South, Kim Yo Jong, sister of leader Kim Jong Un, criticized South Korea’s president and said the tests could lead to a “complete destruction” of bilateral relations. All in all, the latest developments out of Seoul continue a period of fast-paced military competition between the two Koreas, with seemingly tit-for-tat announcements of new weapons and tests as part of an arms race that, currently at least, seems only to be intensifying.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 3, 2021",Navy’s MQ-25 Tanker Drone Refuels F-35C Stealth Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s new MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based tanker drone demonstrator has now refueled the F-35C Lightning II , as the program continues to rack up milestones on its path to frontline service. Topping up the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter means that the EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet and the CMV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor are the only probe-equipped receiver in the service’s modern carrier air wing that has yet to link up with the Stingray test article, also known as T1. Previous refueling trials were conducted this summer between the MQ-25 and the F/A-18F Super Hornet and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye , which has added a new refueling capability in recent years. This latest aerial refueling trial was conducted on September 13 near MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois. The effort was led by the Unmanned Carrier Aviation program office (PMA-268) with Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and involved a combined Navy/Boeing team, in coordination with the F-35 program. “Every T1 flight with another Type/Model/Series aircraft gets us one step closer to rapidly delivering a fully mission-capable MQ-25 to the fleet,” said Navy Captain Chad Reed, the PMA-268 program manager. “Stingray’s unmatched refueling capability is going to increase the Navy’s power projection and provide operational flexibility to the carrier strike group commanders.” The test involving the MQ-25 and F-35C was only the third mid-air refueling flight for the T1 test aircraft, with the two previous sorties, as already noted, having trialed compatibility with the F/A-18F strike fighter and the E-2D radar plane. Bearing in mind the similarities between the F/A-18F and EA-18G, it is not currently clear if the electronic attack jet will require a separate receiver test with the MQ-25. This was also the 36th test sortie in total for the T1. In addition, many more hours of refueling test work have been achieved with simulations using MQ-25 digital models. The latest test event was a three-hour flight, with the F-35C flown by a pilot from the Navy’s Air Test Wing and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23). The stealth jet approached the drone, flying formation evaluations, wake surveys, and drogue tracking. Finally, the F-35C pilot plugged their jet into the MQ-25 test asset at a speed of 225 knots and an altitude of 10,000 feet. Fuel transfer was selected from a ground control station. T1, at left, during the refueling test with an F-35C, seen at bottom right. An F/A-18F Super Hornet is also seen flying in formation with those aircraft., USN Testing the ability to refuel different carrier-based types from an unmanned drone is an entirely new development for the service and is vital to ensure that the Stingray is compatible with the different aerodynamic and performance characteristics of different receiver aircraft. As for the ARS pod, this is more familiar, being the same store, developed and produced by Cobham, that’s carried by F/A-18s outfitted as tankers. After these three refueling tests, the T1 test article will undergo modifications ahead of its next big test event — going aboard an aircraft carrier this winter. The Navy says the drone needs to have a system integrated onto it that will enable personnel to move it around the deck. What carrier will be used for these deck-handling tests is unclear. The Navy has said in the past that four flattops are set to be modified with the Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control System (UMCS) necessary to operate the MQ-25 and that Nimitz class USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) will be the first to receive that upgrade. The Navy needs the MQ-25 not only to free up F/A-18F jets currently assigned to the refueling mission, and to preserve Super Hornet fatigue life, but also to extend the range of both the Super Hornet and the F-35C. This would be a prerequisite of any future conflict with a near-peer opponent, especially one in the broad expanses of the Asia-Pacific theater against China. Now that the plan to outfit the Block III Super Hornet with conformal fuel tanks has been dropped , the need for an organic tanker within the carrier air wing has only been increased. As well as reinstating a dedicated tanker asset to the carrier air wing, the MQ-25’s significance lies in it being the first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft to go aboard a carrier. While the scope of its missions is much reduced from the original Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program, the Navy has confirmed that it expects the MQ-25 to take on additional missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) duties. It should also pave the way toward more sophisticated integration of manned aircraft and drones, or what the Navy describes as manned and unmanned teaming (MUM-T). Ultimately, as The War Zone has explored in the past , the MQ-25 could be well-positioned to take on additional missions in the future, too. The introduction of the MQ-25 is part of a wider doctrinal shift within the carrier air wing, or CVW, in which unmanned platforms will play an increasingly important role. The Navy is now looking to move to a 40-60 unmanned-manned split, before achieving a 60-40 unmanned-manned split in the long term. This is a change from previous proposals for a CVW in 2030, as seen in the graphic below, in which manned aircraft were still very much in the majority. How the forthcoming F/A-XX fighter fits in with these revised ideas remains to be seen, although it is noteworthy that the Navy is also considering potential unmanned options as it looks to replace its Super Hornets under its iteration of the Next Generation Air Dominance program. U.S. Navy In the meantime, production is being kicked off with a first batch of four Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) aircraft that are being completed under a 2018 contract award , to which another three MQ-25s have since been added. The EMD aircraft will be used for further testing at the Boeing facility in St. Louis, Missouri before transiting to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, for the rest of the flight test program, although there will also be tests undertaken at Lakehurst, New Jersey, and Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. There have been some delays to the program, affecting the delivery of a first EMD aircraft, with Boeing pausing work to optimize weight and strength, address an unspecified quality issue, and as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first EMD aircraft is now expected to be delivered in the fall of 2022. Thereafter, if all goes to plan, the Navy expects to field 72 MQ-25s, and to achieve initial operating capacity in Fiscal Year 2025. After that, the sight of Stingrays refueling carrier-based Navy aircraft is set to become much more familiar.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain limited at this time, but there was an incident at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the home of the Air Force’s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber force, early this morning. This has resulted in a circular temporary flight restriction, or TFR, being put up over and around the base, extending six miles in every direction and from the ground up to 8,000 feet. The mishap involved a B-2 that was landing at Whiteman’s only runway. Air Force Global Strike Command issued the following statement to The War Zone shortly after our inquiry: Thank you for the query. There has been an incident at Whiteman AFB. It occurred at approximately 12:30 a.m. on Sept. 14. A U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit experienced and [sic] in-flight malfunction during a routine training mission and was damaged on the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, after an emergency landing. There were no personnel injuries and no fire associated with the landing. The incident is under investigation and more information will be provided as it becomes available. A B-2 landing at Whiteman AFB., USAF You can see the hazard TFR below that is justified to “provide a safe environment for accident investigation.” FAA The B-2 is a low-density, high-value strategic asset and much of it remains highly classified. It is also built and coated with materials that can be extremely toxic if damaged. As such, special precautions such as this TFR would make sense. Whiteman AFB has only one runway. You can see the 14 specially-built B-2 shelters that line the apron. , Google Earth We still don’t know just how badly damaged the B-2 involved is, but the fact that there was no fire and everyone walked away unscathed is a positive sign. There are just 20 of these aircraft in existence out of 21 ever produced. One was lost on departure from Guam in 2008. Another was badly damaged due to a ground fire two years later, but was later returned to service after extensive and very costly repairs. The aircraft is known to be very demanding in terms of maintenance requirements—they are the most expensive weapons-carrying aircraft in the inventory to fly. While there have been other close calls before , the fleet, which is almost experimental in nature due to its tiny size, is kept in top condition thanks to the very dedicated team of Air Force and industry personnel.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 6, 2022",DARPA Wants Cheap Laser Communications Terminals To Allow Any Satellite To Talk To Another,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has unveiled a new project to create a low-cost and readily reconfigurable optical communications system that will help ensure various satellite constellations can share large amounts of data quickly and securely. The agency describes this effort, dubbed Space-Based Adaptive Communications Node, or Space-BACN, as being essential to linking together future distributed satellite networks , which are under development now to support various different, but often complementary missions , including early warning, intelligence gathering, and general communications and data-sharing. DARPA revealed Space-BACN – the acronym is pronounced “bacon” – in a press release on Sept. 13, 2021. Despite the acronym, there is no indication that this project is, in any way, related to the U.S. Air Force’s more down-to-earth E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) aircraft. “Today, we are witnessing the birth of a new domain called proliferated space,” Greg Kuperman, the Space-BACN Program Manager within DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office, explained in a video presentation, seen above, accompanying the press release. “In the upcoming years, we’re going to see thousands of satellites going up into space that are low cost, rapid to field, and highly distributed.” “There could be tens of thousands of small satellites launched into LEO [low Earth orbit] over the next decade as the demand around the world for affordable space-based capabilities grows,” he added in a written statement. “The problem with this growth is that optical communications links are currently engineered to only connect satellites within a given constellation – they can’t dynamically adapt waveforms to communicate with satellites in other constellations.” Kuperman added that, to date, only fixed-rate, single-mode optical communications systems, which use laser light as the mechanism for transferring information, have been demonstrated in space . Those nodes have been shown to be able to transfer large amounts of information very quickly, and do so in ways that are highly secure and jam-resistant, but are also often very costly. “Traditional government optical terminals for coherent space-based optical communications can cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars due to the many precision designed and manufactured components that are hand assembled by highly skilled experts in the field,” Kuperman said. “ Commercial space companies , on the other hand, are developing ultra-optimized, single-mode coherent systems designed to achieve high-rate communications while lowering cost. These lower-cost systems, however, are not reconfigurable nor compatible with any other standard.” The lack of standardization has led to a “fragmented, stove-piped ‘Wild West’ space domain,” according to Kuperman. That’s where Space-BACN comes in. The project is seeking concepts that can produce an optical communications terminal with three core capabilities: a 100 gigabit-per-second transfer rate “to support most optical standards,” a need for no more than 100 Watts of power generation, and a total cost of under $100,000. DARPA refers to these key requirements as “100 Cubed.” Space-BACN will explore proposals for three separate technologies that DARPA hopes it will be able to combine to form a system that meets the 100 Cubed requirements. The first of these is a low-cost optical aperture capable of handling all infrared wavelengths in the C band that will then feed into an affordable single-mode fiber optic line , offering low-cost, but also low-loss transmission capabilities in space. The second component is a reconfigurable modem that can support a variety of different waveforms. The last piece of the puzzle is a “cross-constellation command and control” architecture that can “automate interactions between government and commercial satellites,” according to DARPA. DARPA also wants the entire package to be highly modular and leverage open-architecture systems to allow for components to be rapidly upgraded, or even swapped out entirely. This would enable the rapid integration of new and improved functionality as time goes on. Part of the overall low-cost goal is also for all three core technologies to be able to be produced relatively quickly in large quantities. The terminal itself could be installed on dedicated satellites acting as communications and data-sharing gateways or be integrated with various future satellites to give them this capability directly. Graphics DARPA used to illustrate the desired modularity and open-architecture nature of the final Space-BACN terminal., DARPA “Since Space-BACN is focused on operating in LEO, it will be able to take advantage of advanced low-cost electronics that can reliably operate in lower radiation environments and more easily connect to the large number of other government and commercial LEO satellite constellations,” DARPA’s press release said. “Additionally, the shorter expected life span of LEO satellites – three to five years – combined with the modularity of the Space-BACN terminal will facilitate rapid refresh cycles and insertions of new technology as it becomes available.” “The goal is to not make the perfect solution for everyone, but the good enough solution for most users,” Kuperman added in the video presentation. Another infographic, seen below, describes the desires end result as a “Swiss-Army Knife” DARPA The U.S. military alone has a number of small, distributed satellite constellation projects in progress now that could benefit from something like Space-BACN. DARPA itself is leading a project called Blackjack , which is seeking to demonstrate the feasibility of various components that would be necessary for a relatively low-cost constellation of small satellites in LEO capable of performing early warning and associated communications functions. A specialized data processor, nicknamed Pit Boss , is also being developed within this program to give the entire constellation a high degree of autonomy. Separately, the U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) is working on developing a fielding a new space-based early warning network made up of various “layers” of small satellite constellations. Each one of these layers will perform a different set of functions, from spotting and tracking various threats, including hypersonic weapons, to ensuring the rapid transmission of that data to command and control centers on the ground, which could then be used to attempt an intercept. An infographic showing MDA’s notional multi-layer National Defense Space Architecture., SDA These are just some examples of small satellite programs the U.S. military is working on as it explores ways to reduce the vulnerability of various space-based capabilities, which are currently provided by relatively small numbers of exquisite satellites. A growing number of terrestrial and on-orbit anti-satellite threats have underscored the need for distributed constellations to ensure to the highest degree possible that forces down below will continue to receive various kinds of critical space-based support, such as early warning , intelligence-gathering , navigation and weapon guidance , communications and data-sharing, and more, in any contingency. Space-BACN presents a path toward the U.S. military being able to more rapidly leverage future commercial constellations to bolster its space-based capabilities and capacity, as well. The U.S. Air Force has already been working with private space firm SpaceX to explore how its Starlink satellites could be used to support military operations. Optical communications terminals could also be used on aircraft flying within Earth’s atmosphere . The War Zone specifically highlighted this potential application of this technology in our in-depth feature on what roles and missions that a secretive Air Force high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) stealth drone commonly referred to as the RQ-180 is likely to have. The use of a laser-based satcom system has already been tested aboard MQ-9 Reaper , as well. Other initiatives are likely to exist in the classified domain. In addition, DARPA’s Kuperman said that low-cost optical communications terminals could be extremely beneficial for non-military uses, as well. In the video presentation, he specifically outlined a disaster response/humanitarian relief operations scenario where they could be applicable. “Today, a lack of communications and sensing has hurt first responders’ ability” to act quickly and get “help to people in need,” he explained. “Imagery collected on one satellite system will not be immediately available to responders that are using a different one for communications. And if two teams of rescuers are using communications from two different satellites constellations, then they’ll have limited ability communicate.” All told, the importance of optical communications, for space-based and other uses, has only been becoming more and more obvious in recent years. While highly specialized systems will still likely be necessary for at least some of those applications, DARPA, through the Space-BACN program, is now looking for ways to lower the cost of core elements of this technology to make it easier for various end-users to adopt it on a much broader scale.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fresno-Yosemite International Airport had a very strange pair of visitors this afternoon. Two F-117s landed at the airport in north-central California and taxied over to the 144th Fighter Wing’s base, which is located just to the south of the passenger terminal. You can just imagine people’s surprise when they saw the long-retired (officially) flat-black faceted Nighthawks touch down and taxi to the base with their white drag-chutes billowing behind them. It’s worth noting that at least one of the jets was not fitted with radar reflectors. We reached out to the 144th Fighter Wing’s public affairs department for comment as to what the stealth jets were doing on their ramp. They informed us that their arrival was fully planned and that they would be training with the Wing’s F-15C/D Eagles over the coming days. This is a major development, as even though we have known the F-117s have been providing ‘red air’ aggressor capabilities for a long time now , that mission has never been fully acknowledged by the USAF. Fresno’s F-15s are nearly entirely focused on the air-to-air combat mission set. Fresno-Yosemite International.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sean Towe (@aviatography) As we have stated for years, the F-117’s utility as dissimilar low-observable (stealthy) targets has become a premium offering as stealth technology proliferates among America’s potential adversaries—namely China and Russia. But beyond that, cruise missiles, which fly low and have small radar and infrared signatures, remain a major concern for units that are tasked with the homeland air defense mission, especially those that protect America’s maritime borders. New active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars have been installed on many USAF fighter aircraft tasked with this mission, including the 144th Fighter Wing’s F-15C/Ds, so that they could better spot and engage small radar cross-section targets like cruise missiles. Their Sniper targeting pods —traditionally an air-to-ground sensor system—also give them the ability to visually identify these targets at long range, day or night, so that they can be engaged before it is too late. The Sniper pod can be slaved to a radar track and vice-versa, helping to quickly identify and track potentially hostile targets. A 144th FW F-15C blasts out of Fresno., U.S. Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez This is where the F-117, officially retired 13 years ago and just celebrated its 40th ‘birthday,’ really shines as a dissimilar aggressor. Most pilots have never flown against anything like it before and its reduced infrared and radar signature will give them very advanced training on what it is like to intercept such a hard to detect and unfamiliar target. This is the first in likely many more F-117 ‘road tours’ we will see in the future as the type, and the “Black Knights” who fly and maintain them, step out of the shadows. So far they have been to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California on a short deployment and the type was seen operating out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada once again, the latter of which not far from the Nighthawks’ clandestine home at Tonopah Test Range Airport . There was also some chatter that they may have gone to Eglin or Tyndall Air Force Bases in Florida for a recent exercise, as well, although that deployment remains unconfirmed. Now that they can refuel from any USAF KC-135, they can expand their reach with ease.

Regardless, this is a big step in the F-117’s now-notorious second shot at life and yet another indicator that they will become a more common sight at various installations around the U.S. in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 23, 2021",This Mysterious Unmanned Vessel Was Just Spotted In San Diego Bay (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is accelerating its unmanned surface vessel initiatives seemingly on all fronts . While much of the latest integration testing of these new concepts, which range from tiny remotely controlled boats to far larger, missile toting, optionally manned surface vessels, have occurred off of Southern California, some of these capabilities will soon be put to the test in the Middle East as part of a new task force being formed under the 5th Fleet. Still, San Diego will remain the epicenter of the most advanced and cutting-edge testing. As such, we are bound to see an increasing amount of bizarre-looking vessels with no humans onboard them coming and going from the picturesque bay. That was certainly the case today when a new mystery drone boat was spotted trolling around San Diego’s wharf area and was subsequently photographed by @CJR1321 , with those images being posted by our friend @WarshipCam. As @WarshipCam points out in the tweet above, the unmanned surface vehicle in question was dubbed Catbus on MarineTraffic.com . As you can see, the little catamaran includes large solar panels and a host of antennas, radar, as well as what looks like possibly a small FLIR ball mounted in front of its mast. A flat, puck-like enclosure above the FLIR appears to also include fixed cameras for situational awareness and navigation purposes. @CJR1321 Catbus appears to be moored down at the harbor by Cesar Chavez Park, just on the northwestern side of the Coronado bridge. Marinetraffic.com Marinetraffic.com It isn’t clear if the mystery vessel is taking part in some sort of manufacturer trials or something having more to do directly with the U.S. Navy. Considering the locale, we can probably assume the latter. It’s also worth noting that Marinetraffic.com places Catbus at the Port of Melville about 18 days before appearing in San Diego. Melville is near Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Also located very close by is the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Newport, which is currently involved with a large number of unmanned naval initiatives , including those with the port security mission set. As to who built this unmanned vessel or what exactly its mission is, we can’t say definitively, but it is similar in configuration to other unmanned vessels we have seen, such as the Marine Advanced Robotics WAM-V family of USVs. We are bound to learn more about this mysterious little USV. We will report back as soon as we do. UPDATE: @CJR1321 went to check the drone boat out where it was parked and gained some great information to share, as well as some new shots. Here’s the deal: The ship is made by Raytheon and it is a prototype using a converted racing catamaran. They will test it in the ocean tomorrow. Roughly 18 feet long (estimate) Solar-powered Can reach speeds up to 13 knots Withstands about 3-foot waves so it is not designed for very rough seas Designed to fit in a container for shipment anywhere in the world Will tow an acoustic array Amazing stuff! A huge thanks to CJR1321 for putting in the extra legwork here. One would think the endurance is extremely long if it is solar-powered and that is some high-speed dash capability for a craft that is run on solar. It could be a very tough sonar picket node to contend with. @CJR1321 @CJR1321 @CJR1321 UPDATE: She left San Diego Bay and headed out into the Pacific for trials today and in doing so hit a speed of 17.5 knots according to Marinetraffic.com: Marinetraffic.com Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 28, 2021",Chinese Warships Sailing Near Alaska’s Aleutian Islands Shadowed By U.S. Coast Guard (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Coast Guard recently released a set of pictures of the Legend class cutter USCGC Bertholf shadowing a group of four Chinese warships sailing in America’s Exclusive Economic Zone near Alaska’s Aleutian Islands back in August. The emergence of these pictures follows the editor-in-chief of Global Times , a newspaper under the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party, taking to Twitter to criticize U.S. Navy operations in the Pacific that routinely challenge many of Beijing’s widely disputed maritime territorial claims, especially in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait , and warn of tit-for-tat activities on the part of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. The pictures were shot between Aug. 29 and Aug. 30, 2021, but were only released through the U.S. military’s Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) website more recently. The captions to the photographs, which have now, curiously, been removed from DVIDS, say they were taken “in international waters inside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] off the Aleutian Island [sic] coast.” It’s not clear if any Chinese vessels are still inside the U.S. EEZ off the coast of Alaska, which stretches well out into the Pacific Ocean, but The War Zone has already reached out to the U.S. Coast Guard for more information. The Legend class cutter USCGC Bertholf in the Bering Sea on Aug. 24, 2021., USCG The exact identities of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships that were inside the EEZ in August are unclear. However, the caption to one of the pictures, seen at the top of this story, says that “the PLAN task force included a guided missile cruiser, a guided missile destroyer, a general intelligence vessel, and an auxiliary vessel.” Independent observers have already noted that Japanese authorities had reported four PLAN warships transiting east to west through the Soya Strait, which would have pointed them in the general direction of the EEZ off Alaska, on Aug. 24. Those vessels included a Type 055 destroyer , which the U.S. military has categorized as a cruiser in the past, as well as a Type 052D destroyer , a Type 903 replenishment ship, and an intelligence-gathering ship with the hull number 799. This would align perfectly with the Coast Guard’s description of the four Chinese ships sailing near the Aleutians. It also represents a very capable, multi-purpose task force. The Type 055, in particular, is the PLAN’s most modern surface warship and has more than 100 vertical launch system cells that can be loaded, as required, with a variety of surface-to-air, anti-ship, and land-attack missiles. What level of interaction the Coast Guard has had, or may still be having, with these Chinese ships is unclear. The caption for another one of the pictures, seen below, does say it shows the Bertholf ‘s commanding officer, Captain Tim Brown, as he “communicates with a Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy ship operating as part of a four-ship PLAN task force” and that “interactions between Coast Guard Cutters Bertholf and Kimball , [another Legend class cutter] which is also operating in the area, and the PLAN vessels were safe and professional, and verbal communications were in accordance with international standards.” US Coast Guard Captain Tim Brown, USCGC Bertholf ‘s commanding officer, communicates with a Chinese warship near Alaska in August 2021., USCG The appearance of these pictures online does notably follow a Tweet from Global Times editor-in-chief  Hu Xijin on Sept. 8. Hu was reacting directly to other posts on that social media site from official U.S. Navy accounts that highlighted the arrival of the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea “in order to uphold the free and open use of Indo-Pacific waters.” The Chinese government has expansive territorial claims over this body of water, which are widely rejected by other countries in the region and the international community at large. “Hopefully when Chinese warships pass through the Caribbean Sea or show up near Hawaii and Guam one day, the US will uphold the same standard of freedom of navigation,” Hu wrote on Twitter. “That day will come soon.” Also on Sept. 8, the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Benfold had conducted what is known as a freedom of navigation patrol, or FONOP, within 12 miles of Mischief Reef, which Chinese authorities say is their territorial waters, in the Spratly Island chain in the South China Sea. The service also denied reports that Chinese forces had chased Benfold out of the area. This all followed the Chinese government’s announcement on Sept. 1 that it had instituted new rules requiring many categories of foreign vessels, not just warships, to identify themselves and provided additional information after entering the country’s territorial waters. The Chinese government has established a number of man-made outposts in the South China Sea, including in Mischief Reef, which it uses, together with the increasingly regular deployment of various maritime forces , to assert its claims in the region. The U.S. Navy, as well as the Coast Guard in more recent years, regularly conducts FONOPs in the South China Sea , and elsewhere in the Pacific , to challenge those disputed territorial claims. Global Times ‘ Hu’s comments were as much about FONOPs, in general, as the news about the USS Carl Vinson and her strike group, specifically. The U.S. Navy’s Office of the Chief of Information, or CHINFO, had already responded, via its own official Twitter account, to Hu’s Tweet. “The @USNavy has upheld the standards of freedom of navigation longer than the PLA navy has existed,” CHINFO’s initial response read. This was followed by a succession of Tweets detailing various instances in recent years where Chinese warships have sailed in international waters in the general vicinity of the United States without any interference from the U.S. military. The Coast Guard’s photos of PLAN vessels in the U.S. EEZ off Alaska present yet another example of these kinds of interactions. This isn’t the first time Chinese warships have appeared in international waters off the coast of that state, either. In 2015, the PLAN sent five ships into the Bering Sea , north of the Aleutians, during a visit there by then-President Barack Obama. In addition, it’s worth noting that Russian warships have sailed relatively close to U.S. territorial waters, including off Hawaii and Alaska , over the years without issue. This includes an instance just earlier this year when a task force from Russia’s Pacific Fleet sailed within at least 34 miles of the Hawaiian Islands. Unlike the Chinese government and its claims in the South China Sea, the U.S. government does not assert that vast sections of the Pacific near Hawaii or Guam, or any large portion of the Caribbean , are in fact its territorial waters. Of course, in all of these instances, the U.S. military has also closely monitored this foreign naval activity. A new over-arching naval strategy document that the U.S. Navy, together with the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard, put out last year did put heavy emphasis on monitoring and documenting aggressive maritime activity on the part of China, as well as Russia, going forward. Regardless, the appearance of the Chinese ships near the Aleutian Islands does simply underscore the increasing blue water capabilities of the PLAN in the Pacific , as well as elsewhere around the world . If this Chinese naval task force spotted sailing near the Aleutians ultimately continued further north, it could be headed to, or at least near the ever-more-strategic Arctic region. This is an area that is also reportedly seeing increased Chinese maritime activity , as well as a growing presence on the part of the Russian military . The United States is hardly the only one facing the prospect of increasingly routine PLAN naval activities closer to its shores, either. Just yesterday, the Japanese Ministry of Defense announced that Japan Maritime Self Defense Force ships and aircraft had been tracking what is believed to be a Chinese submarine sailing in a “contiguous zone” off Amami Oshima island. Amami is situated between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Okinawa. A contiguous zone is defined as the 12 miles beyond a country’s territorial waters, where, under international law , “a coastal State may exercise the control necessary to prevent the infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea, and punish infringement of those laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea.” So, no matter what, Global Times ‘ Hu’s comments about increasing Chinese naval operations in waters around the United States, as well as other countries, particularly in the Pacific, is a reality now. Whether the U.S. military responds any differently going forward, especially if the PLAN continues to step up this kind of activity, remains to be seen, but at this point, the U.S. Navy appears to welcome the activity as it validates its own freedom of navigation operations. Updated 9/14/2021: The U.S. Coast Guard has reuploaded the pictures in question to Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) website with some additional details. The captions now note that the USCGC Bertholf had been conducting a “routine maritime patrol in the Bering Sea and Arctic region” when it encountered the Chinese warships. The Coast Guard has also now stressed that, while these vessels did enter the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off Alaska, “at no point did the PLAN task force enter U.S. territorial waters.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Americas Around The Globe China Indo-Pacific News & Features U.S. Homeland"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 4, 2022",Longer-Range Rockets Used In New Attack On Al Asad Air Base In Iraq Point To Iran,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new attack aimed at a base in Iraq that hosts American troops looks to have been carried out using 122mm rockets with greater range and more destructive power than the 107mm types more typically employed in these incidents. This strongly indicates that Iranian-backed militias in the country were responsible, though the U.S. government has not yet blamed any specific group or groups. The rockets also do not appear to have killed anyone directly in this particular instance, but a contractor working for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria did suffer a heart attack and later died. This latest rocket attack on Iraq’s Al Asad Air Base, which is a major hub for U.S. and other coalition forces, occurred at around 7:20 AM local time on March 3, 2021. This facility was also infamously the primary target of an unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strike in January 2020. New details, as well as previously unseen video footage, about that incident just emerged this past weekend, which you can read about in more detail in this War Zone piece . A picture reportedly showing a rocket launcher hidden inside a civilian truck that was used in the attack on Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on March 3, 2021., via Twitter A total of 10 rockets hit the facility, according to U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, the top spokesperson for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), the official name of the international coalition battling ISIS. Beyond the one associated fatality, there have been no reports of any additional casualties, so far. U.S. Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) defense systems, which you can read about in more detail in this War Zone piece , did engage the incoming threats , but it’s unclear how many may have been knocked down. “Iraqi SF [security forces] are leading the response & investigation,” Marotto wrote on Twitter. “Further information will be released as it becomes available.” “There are no current reports of U.S. servicemember injuries and all are accounted for,” the Pentagon said in a subsequent statement . “A U.S. civilian contractor suffered a cardiac episode while sheltering and sadly passed away shortly after.” “Iraqi security forces are on scene and investigating,” it continued. “We cannot attribute responsibility at this time, and we do not have a complete picture of the extent of the damage.” While it remains unclear who is responsible for this attack, it comes less than a week after President Joe Biden ordered airstrikes on a base that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias operate in neighboring Syria. Those strikes had been carried out in retaliation for a rocket attack last month on Erbil Airport, in the northern Iraqi city of the same name, which is the capital of the country’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region. That attack killed another coalition contractor and injured a U.S. service member, among other casualties. When it comes to this new incident, the timing is notably unusual. Rocket attacks aimed at U.S. military and diplomatic sites in Iraq, as well as those where other coalition members operate from, which are generally linked to Iranian-backed militias, typically occur in the evening or overnight. In addition, Sabreen News , an outlet linked to Kataib Hezbollah , one of Iraq’s largest Iranian-supported groups, among others, reported that the rockets used in this attack were Iranian-made 122mm Arash-4 types, also known as the Long Range Arash. The Arash-series is based on the Soviet-era 122mm artillery rocket family, variants of which remain in service worldwide and are most commonly associated with the truck-mounted Grad system . Pictures of the remains of the rocket launcher employed in this new attack on Al Asad show features, especially the general size and length of the individual launch tubes, that would fit well with the reports of Arash-series rockets being employed in this incident. Per a brochure from Iran’s Defense Industries Organization (DIO), the Long Range Arash has a maximum range of 40 kilometers, or just under 25 miles, and a warhead weighing 22 kilograms, or around 48 and a half pounds. The Long Range Arash is a significantly more capable rocket than the Iranian-made 107mm Fadjr-1, which has been a weapon of choice for Iranian-backed militias in Iraq for years now . The Fadjr-1 is an Iranian clone of a very popular Chinese design that first entered service in the 1960s and remains in widespread use around the world. The version Iran produces has a maximum range of just 8.3 kilometers, or just over 5 miles, and a warhead weighing 7.9 kilograms, or just under 17 and a half pounds, according to the DIO brochure. A page from a brochure from Iran’s Defense Industries Organization (DIO) giving the specifications for the Fadjr-1 rocket., DIO A page from the same DIO brochure with details about the Long Range Arash rocket., DIO The launcher used in the attack today was also concealed within a civilian truck, a tactic that is commonly seen in rocket attacks tied to Iranian-supported groups in Iraq, regardless of the type of weapon used. Photographs from the launch site show what looks to be a WiFi hotspot and a small camera, suggesting that the launch may have been recorded remotely, as well. Militant and terrorist groups regularly film attacks, including via small drones , for propaganda purposes. The apparent size of the rockets and the all-around sophistication of this setup all add weight to the involvement of Iranian-backed groups in this attack, as well. This is not the first time that Arash-series rockets have reportedly been used in attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. There were very strong indications that these weapons were used in another attack on Erbil in September 2020, including a launch point said to be approximately 40 kilometers from the points of impact. Later reports on that incident said the actual distance was shorter, which could have pointed to the use of shorter-range members of the Arash family that are still more capable than the Fadjr-1. At the same time, it’s worth noting that DIO says that the Long Range Arash can engage targets as little a 4 kilometers away, meaning that these rockets could still have been employed in that case, but at less than their maximum range. No matter what, the use of longer-range rockets, together with the early-morning timing of this latest attack on Al Asad, would seem to suggest that Iranian-backed groups are looking to send a message to the United States about the actual size and scope of their capabilities, as well as their resolve. After the airstrikes on the militia base in Syria last week, the Pentagon said the goal had been to carry them out in a way specifically intended to try to avoid further escalation. “One of the things we were certainly hoping to achieve as a result of that strike was to deter future attacks by militia groups on our people, our facilities and our Iraqi partners, and we certainly hope that it has that effect,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said during an off-camera press conference just yesterday. “There hasn’t been – since the – the strike last week, there hasn’t been any attacks by militia groups on our people and we – we hope that that remains the case.” “You can’t act with impunity,” President Biden had told reporters last week in response to questions about the intent of the airstrikes in Syria. “Be careful.” All of this comes as the Biden administration continues to try to focus on engaging Iran, especially over the controversial international deal regarding that country’s nuclear program, diplomatically. The actions of Iranian-supported proxies throughout the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Yemen , have frustrated those efforts, but it’s not clear how much of this is a deliberate campaign on Iran’s part to strengthen its negotiating positions, especially on the issue of sanctions relief, versus an expression of local grievances. U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the top American military command overseeing operations in the Middle East, said in January that Iranian proxies are “generally responsive” to directives from Tehran, but also acknowledged that “not every entity at every level” always does as its told. It also remains to be seen how Biden and his administration will respond to this latest rocket attack. The President has faced criticism from members of Congress, including individuals from his own Democratic Party, over the legality of the recent airstrikes in Syria. From what we know so far about the attack today on Al Asad Air Base, especially the apparent use of more capable 122mm rockets, it certainly seems that whoever carried it out was looking to at least show their ability to escalate things, despite the U.S. government’s desire to prevent that from happening.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 21, 2022",Navy Patrol Craft Fired Warning Shots At Harassing Iranian Boats In the Persian Gulf,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says that its Cyclone class patrol craft USS Firebolt fired warning shots toward a group of three small Iranian boats during an altercation yesterday in the Persian Gulf. This disclosure comes less than a day after the service confirmed that another group of boats belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including a unique catamaran , had harassed U.S. Coast Guard cutters in that same body of water. Firebolt was sailing together with the U.S. Coast Guard’s Island class patrol boat USCGC Baranoff during the incident , which started at around 8:00 PM local time on April 26. The Navy did not identify the types of small Iranian boats that harassed the American ships, but the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is known to operate a diverse fleet of small craft in this general category. A stock image of the USS Firebolt ., USN The Iranian boats “failed to exercise due regard for the safety of other vessels as required under international law as they came into close proximity to U.S. naval vessels in international waters,” the Navy said in a statement. “The IRGCN [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy] armed speed boats rapidly approached U.S. Navy patrol coastal ship USS Firebolt (PC 10) and U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat USCGC Baranoff (WPB 1318) to an unnecessarily close range with unknown intent, including a closest point of approach (CPA) of 68 yards to both U.S. ships.” “The U.S. crews issued multiple warnings via bridge-to-bridge radio and loud-hailer devices, but the IRGCN vessels continued their close range maneuvers,” the press release continued. “The crew of Firebolt then fired warning shots, and the IRGCN vessels moved away to a safe distance from the U.S. vessels.” The Navy did not say what weapon or weapons the Firebolt had used to warn off the Iranian boats. The primary gun armament of each Cyclone class patrol craft is a pair of 25mm automatic cannons, mounted one each at the bow and toward the stern. They also have various smaller machine guns and automatic grenade launchers on mounts around the boat, as well as a launcher for AGM-176 Griffin precision-guided missiles. The video below highlights the different weapons onboard the Cyclone class patrol craft. https://youtube.com/watch?v=iSm1rdK29Eo “Throughout the interaction, U.S. forces proactively communicated with the IRGCN vessels and executed pre-planned responses to reduce the risk of miscalculation, avoid a collision, and to de-escalate the situation,” the Navy added. “U.S. naval forces continue to remain vigilant and are trained to act in a professional manner, while our commanding officers retain the inherent right to act in self-defense.” “The IRGCN’s actions increased the risk of miscalculation and/or collision, were not in accordance with the internationally recognized Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) “rules of the road” or internationally recognized maritime customs,” the Navy stressed. “In addition, the IRGCN actions were not in accordance with the obligation under international law to act with due regard for the safety of other vessels in the area.” A stock image of the USCGC Baranoff ., US Army The incident follows a similar encounter between a pair of the Coast Guard’s Island class patrol boats and a group of IRGCN boats, including the Harth 55 class catamaran Shahid Nazeri, on April 2. You can read more about that here . The Wall Street Journal first reported on that earlier incident yesterday and the Navy confirmed it today, but there had been no previous mention of this more recent and serious dustup. It’s not clear when the last time Navy ships have fired in the direction of Iranian boats, even as a warning, in the Persian Gulf or anywhere else. The USS Thunderbolt , another Cyclone class patrol craft, did fire warning shots at boats belonging to the IRGCN during an incident in 2017. There were no shots fired during an incident last year , in which a swarm of Iranian vessels harassed a group of Navy and Coast Guard vessels in the Persian Gulf, including USS Firebolt . After that, however, then-President Donald Trump declared that he had “instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea” in one of his signature Tweets. The President clarified later that day that the rules of engagement had not changed and that “We’re covered 100 percent.” This incident certainly stands in marked contrast to an incident in January 2016, in which the crews of two Navy Riverine Command Boats (RCB) surrendered themselves to IRGC forces after drifting into Iranian territorial waters near Farsi Island. One of the RCBs had broken down as both boats conducted a routine transit through the area. That international incident came to a close 15 hours later when Iran released the 10 sailors . The U.S. government denied issuing a formal apology to Iran, but the incident was a major propaganda coup for the regime in Tehran and became a major point of criticism of President Barack Obama and his administration. Iran has a long history of harassing American warships in the Persian Gulf, but this practice had largely evaporated by the middle of the Trump administration for reasons that remain unclear. Other forms of provocative Iranian behavior, from seizing commercial vessels to using drones for harassment , did continue in the region . There were also a string of outright attacks, linked back to Iran , on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. In 2019, the United States and Iran notably came dangerously close to open conflict after the IRGC shot down a Navy RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) drone over the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. government also accused Iran of directly carrying out an unprecedented combination of drone and missile strikes on targets in Saudi Arabia later that year. This all was, of course, followed by the U.S. military’s killing of Iranian General Qassem Soliemani , head of the IRGC’s Quds Force, its branch responsible for operations outside of the country, in Iraq in January 2020 and Iran’s retaliatory ballistic missiles strikes on basing hosting American troops in that country. President Joe Biden’s administration is now attempting to negotiate, indirectly, with Iran about the U.S. government rejoining a controversial multi-national deal regarding Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. In this context, Iranian officials have been publicly calling for Biden to relax crippling Trump-era sanctions on their country. Biden has stressed his intent not to offer any sanctions relief as a precondition to getting back into the so-called Iran Deal, but there have been reports that there may be some flexibility in this position. Elements of the IRGC could certainly be working to try to strengthen Iran’s negotiation position and there are also certainly spoilers in Iran who are keen to undermine any rapprochement between the two countries. With all that in mind, there also have been and remain questions about just how much control Iran’s leadership actually exercises over day-to-day IRGC operations. “The activities we usually see from the IRGC Navy are not necessarily activities directed by the supreme leader from the Iranian state, rather irresponsible actions by local commanders on scene,” Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said at an event hosted by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) just today. “We are very careful so as not to get into a provocative cycle as a result of that. Luckily our guys are very good … and they’re able to de-escalate.” Clearly, at least some elements of the IRGC would prefer to see the situation heat up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 26, 2021",Biden Orders Strikes On Iranian-Backed Militias’ Growing Unmanned Aircraft Arsenal (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has released footage of airstrikes on three separate sites operated by Iranian-backed militias along the Iraqi-Syrian border. These strikes, which President Joe Biden ordered, primarily targeted these groups’ growing unmanned aircraft capabilities and follow an increasing number of drone attacks on bases in Iraq that host American personnel in recent months. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) posted the trio of videos online on June 28, 2021, the day after the strikes occurred. All three of the sites struck by American warplanes were in the general vicinity of the town of Al Bukamal in Syria and Al-Qa’im, immediately opposite it on the Iraqi side of the border. The Pentagon had also named Kata’ib Hezbollah and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, specifically, as being among “several Iran-backed militia groups” that utilized these facilities. A screengrab from footage US Central Command released of a strike on a facility operated by Iranian-backed militias in Al Hury, Syria., CENTCOM “We took necessary, appropriate, deliberate action that is designed to limit the risk of escalation, but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a press conference in Rome, where he is conducting an official visit, today. “The targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby had said in an earlier statement . “As demonstrated by this evening’s strikes, President Biden has been clear that he will act to protect U.S. personnel. Given the ongoing series of attacks by Iran-backed groups targeting U.S. interests in Iraq, the President directed further military action to disrupt and deter such attacks.” Al Bukamal and Al-Qa’im also together form an extremely strategic crossing point between the two countries. Biden had previously ordered strikes on other targets linked to Kait’ib Hezbollah and Kait’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, among others, in this same general area in February, the first such strikes of his presidency. This was in retaliation for the death of a U.S. contractor in a rocket attack on Erbil International Airport in northern Iraq earlier that month. Kait’ib Hezbollah has been the target of other American airstrikes in recent years, as well. All three of the videos are labeled as having occurred in Syria, but only two of the sites, one identified by CENTCOM as Al Hury and another as As Sisak, are in that country. A third, which CENTCOM identified as Qasabat, also written as Qasaabat, is in Iraq, south of Al-Qa’im. This appears to be a simple error since Pentagon Press Secretary Kirby’s initial statement had said that the strikes were on “two locations in Syria and one location in Iraq.” A map showing the general locations of the strikes that the U.S. military conducted along the Iraq-Syria border on June 27, 2021, based on geolocation done by Twitter user @obretix of the facilities seen in the footage that CENTCOM released., Google Maps A closer look at the three locations and their relationship to the Iraq-Syria border. Just how close the two facilities struck in Syria were to each other is plainly visible., Google Maps CENTCOM said that the site at Al Hury was “a facility used by Iran-backed militia groups for logistical support and transfer of advanced conventional weapons including unmanned aerial vehicles,” while the one at As Sisak was “a facility used by Iran-backed militia groups as a coordination center for the shipment and transfer of advanced conventional weapons.” The target in Qasabat was “a facility used by Iran-backed militia groups for operations, planning, and storage of unmanned aerial vehicles.” In the past, the term “advanced conventional weapons” has been used as a catchall for, among other things, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems ( MANPADS ), as well as other kinds of missiles and precision-guided munitions, advanced sensors and lasers, and “heavy military equipment,” such as tanks and aircraft, according to the U.S. State Department . U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle combat jets conducted the strikes on the targets in Syria, while that service’s F-16CM Viper fighters carried out the strikes on the facility in Iraq. The U.S. military does not currently have combat jets of any kind based in Iraq itself. The F-15Es almost certainly came from the contingent based in neighboring Jordan , which have been used to conduct these kinds of strikes in the region in the past. There are presently F-16s deployed to Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as well as at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, either of which could have been involved in this operation. A fully-loaded F-15E Strike Eagle takes off from Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan in 2020., USAF F-16 Vipers at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates in 2020., USAF The Coordinating Committee of the Iraqi Resistance, an umbrella organization of Shiite Muslim militias in the country, many of which receive direct support from Iran, said in a statement that there had been casualties as a result of the strikes, but did not elaborate. The Pentagon said that it did not assess that there had been any civilian casualties, but did not offer any details about casualties or materiel losses inflicted on the targeted groups. The Pentagon did not specify any particular drone attacks by Iranian-supported militias that these strikes were in response to, but there have been a number of such incidents in the past few months. These include two separate attacks in May that caused damage to buildings at Al Asad Air Base and Erbil International Airport. The target in the latter case reportedly was, and may still be, being used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Erbil is known to be a launchpad for U.S. operations tied to the CIA, as well as the U.S. military secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Both of these locations were also targets of the infamous Iranian ballistic missile strikes in January 2020, which were in direct retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani , then the head of the Quds Force. The Quds Force is the part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Corps tasked with operations outside of the country, including supporting foreign proxy forces, such as militia groups in Iraq. Just this Saturday, June 26, there was another reported drone attack in Erbil. Pictures emerged afterward reportedly of components recovered afterward of at least one drone that had been employed in that incident, showing a relatively small, fixed-wing design. That incident occurred on the same day that militias belonging to the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a nominally Iraqi government-controlled umbrella organization that included a number of Iranian-backed groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, held a major parade in Baghdad. A number of unmanned aircraft were displayed at that event that appeared to be either of Iranian origin or that had significant similarities to Iranian designs, including larger types capable of dropping small, precision-guided munitions. Drone have been a feature at other parades by PMF elements, which are also referred to as Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), as well. It remains unclear if these were operational drones or mockups, but they certainly do represent a level of very real capability that Iran and its proxies have already demonstrated during attacks , including on U.S. supported groups and their American advisors in Syria, in the past. The groups within the PMF have been publicly and at times violently at odds with the central government in Iraq, as well as the United States and other foreign forces, and their increasingly advanced military capabilities have long been a cause for concern, in general. The uptick in drone attacks linked to these militias has also been a prime example of the very threat posed by even low-tier, commercial-grade unmanned aircraft , which can be readily modified to drop improvised munitions or otherwise carry explosive charges or other payloads . U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of CENTCOM, has been sounding the alarm , as have others, including us here at The War Zone , about this reality, and the low barrier for entry when it comes to groups looking to pursue unmanned aircraft capabilities, for years now. “These small- and medium-sized UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] proliferating across the [area of operations] present a new and complex threat to our forces and those of our partners and allies,” McKenzie told members of Congress at a hearing in April . “For the first time since the Korean War, we are operating without complete air superiority.” Iranian-backed militias carrying out drone strikes targeting U.S. personnel and American retaliatory strikes against those groups also underscore the complex geopolitical situation facing the government in Iraq, which has long attempted to straddle both sides. A statement from Iraq’s armed forces slammed the latest American strikes as “a blatant and unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty and Iraqi national security in accordance with all international conventions.” At the same time, “Iraq renews its refusal to be an arena for settling accounts, and clings to its right to sovereignty over its lands, and prevents it from being used as an arena for reactions and attacks,” that statement added, which could be seen as seeking to place blame on both sides. “We call for calm and avoiding escalation in all its forms, stressing that Iraq will carry out the necessary investigations, procedures and contacts at various levels to prevent such violations.” In March, it had been reported that Iranian-backed militias had offered to cease attacks aimed at American forces if Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al Kadhimi would make a formal and public demand for their complete withdrawal. In April, the two countries issued a statement that included a commitment to the eventual withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from the country, but did not set any specific timeline or promise the departure of all American forces. All of this comes as the United States and Iran appear to be in a stalemate over the former’s return to a controversial international deal over the nuclear ambitions of the regime in Tehran. Since President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. government out of that agreement in 2018 , Iranian authorities have violated all of its key provisions . In addition, earlier this month, Ebrahim Raisi, a hardliner close to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, won the country’s latest presidential election , which the U.S. derided as neither free nor fair. This has raised concerns about a potential further spike in tensions between the two countries. There has notably been an uptick in altercations between U.S. and Iranian military vessels in the Persian Gulf this year , as well, including two instances where American patrol boats fired warning shots. With regards to the strikes in Iraq and Syria, it remains to be seen just how significant an impact they may have actually had on the ability of Iranian-backed groups to launch drone strikes at American interests in the region. Only time will tell how those militias, who continue to expand their military capabilities and use them to target American interests, as well as their benefactors in Tehran, will receive the broader message the U.S. government says it trying to send. UPDATE: 4:15 PM EST — U.S. forces at an unspecified location in Syria were subjected to a rocket attack today, according to U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, the top spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in that country, as well as Iraq. “There are no injuries and damage is being assessed,” he wrote in a Tweet. Video footage purporting to show Iranian-backed militias launching the rockets has also emerged on social media, and the clear suggestion is that this was in response to the American airstrikes yesterday. In addition, Saraya Awliya Al Dam, or the Avengers of Blood Companies, another Iranian-backed militant group in the region, has threatened to at least try to start shooting down U.S. military aircraft flying over Iraq. Saraya Awliya Al Dam had claimed responsibility for the rocket attack on Erbil International Airport that killed the U.S. contractor in February, which, in turn, had prompted American airstrikes along the Iraq-Syria border. UPDATE: 4:45 PM EST — U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto has added an update to his previous statement, saying that the U.S. forces in Syria that came under rocket attack “acted in self-defense” and returned fire with unspecified artillery.

Brett Tingley and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 14, 2021",Missile Defense Agency Lays Out How It Plans To Defend Against Hypersonic Threats,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, has offered a glimpse into how it plans to spot, track, and intercept hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, or HGVs, in a new animated video presentation recently posted online. The animation lays out, step-by-step, its latest “multi-layered solution to defend against the next generation of hypersonic glide vehicles.” Most notably, this animation offers a new look into how it will integrate the Glide Phase Interceptor, or GPI, a still-in-development weapon aimed at defeating HGV threats in the glide phase of their trajectories, into this larger concept of operations. The new video depicting this system, titled “MDA Concept for Regional Hypersonic Missile Defense: Technology to Defeat the Threat,” describes MDA’s plans “to protect the US, its deployed forces, and allies against regional hypersonic threats using a multi-layered solution to defend against the next generation of hypersonic glide vehicles,” according to the video’s description. The MDA’s current concept for a Regional Hypersonic Missile Defense system combines Aegis Combat System -equipped surface vessels with both space-based and ground-based sensor systems , and ties them together with various integrated fire control and sensor fusion networks. The aforementioned GPI, along with the increasingly capable Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), a multi-purpose weapon that already has the ability to engage certain ballistic missiles in the terminal stage of their flight, would then be used to prosecute the incoming HGVs. A screengrab from the recently released Missile Defense Agency video presentation on its Regional Hypersonic Missile Defense concept., MDA Missile defense is a complicated proposition , to begin with, but attempting to intercept HGVs presents unique challenges . Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles are unpowered and typically use a rocket booster to get to a desired speed and altitude. The vehicle is then released from the rest of the weapon and comes gliding back down along an atmospheric trajectory toward its target at hypersonic speeds, defined as anything about Mach 5. While not all HGVs are designed in exactly the same way , they are all, at their core, designed to be able to make sudden and unpredictable movements along their flight paths, especially when compared to the trajectories followed by traditional ballistic missiles, even those that feature maneuverable reentry vehicles. This maneuverability, combined with their high speed and general flight profile, makes it extremely hard to spot and track them, especially with sensors designed with more typical ballistic missiles in mind. This, in turn, shortens the available window a defender has to react in any way, whether it be an attempt to intercept the incoming vehicles, or simply trying to move critical assets out of harm’s way or otherwise seeking cover. A very rudimentary graphic showing a notional HGV flight profile compared to that of a traditional ballistic missile. The flight path of a low-flying air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile is also shown for comparison., GAO In addition to a brief introduction to the components of the hypersonic defense concept, the MDA video starts by graphically showing the difficulties associated with detecting and tracking incoming HGVs, let alone trying to swat them down, with a scenario involving one of these weapons launched at an aircraft carrier. The HGV is shown flying under a cone representing the typical area that applicable radars on U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyers will search when operating in the ballistic missile defense role. A screengrab from the recently released MDA video showing how an Aegis-equipped Arleigh Burke class destroyer operating in the ballistic missile defense role typically detects and tracks targets compared to the flight profile of a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle., MDA The video then continues to describe how the planned hypersonic defense concept would change a similar scenario involving the launch of four HGVs. MDA walks through each step of their proposed multi-layered defense concept in the video. In the video, two space-based sensors from the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) constellation detect the launches and track the HGVs while they’re still attached to their boosters and flying along a more typical ballistic trajectory. Those sensors then continue to track the HGVs after they separate, providing a “fire control-quality track” for subsequent intercept attempts. In 2019, MDA kicked off a competition to build these missile defense satellites when it awarded initial development contracts to four companies, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Leidos, and L3Harris. In January, it picked Northrop Grumman and L3Harris to move onto the next phase. The goal in the past has been to have the first HBTSS satellite deployed in 2023. It’s not clear how many total satellites are now expected to form the HBTSS constellation, which is just one of the myriad planned space-based early warning and missile defense sensors that the U.S. military plans to put into orbit in the coming years. Concept art Northrop Grumman has released around its HBTSS proposal., Northrop Grumman MDA says that the tracking and targeting information from the HBTSS sensors will feed information into the Ballistic Missile Defense Overhead Persistent Infrared Architecture (BOA), a sensor fusion architecture. That data, which is continuously updated in near-real-time, is then used to track the HGVs. The HBTSS tracking information is then forwarded to Aegis-equipped destroyers via BOA, as well as through MDA’s separate Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) network, using satellite communications. Though not stated specifically in the video, C2BMC provides links to and from an array of other ground, sea, and space-based sensors beyond HBTSS. This includes Aegis-equipped warships, which can work together to relay tracking and targeting information between themselves while attempt to intercept incoming HGVs. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Hopper fires an SM-3 ballistic missile interceptor during a test., USN With all this information in hand, one or more of those destroyers can then initiate so-called “Engage on Remote” (EoR) intercepts, which use only offboard tracking and targeting data, rather than its own radars to direct the interceptor to its target. They can also conduct what are called “Launch on Remote” intercepts, in which anti-hypersonic interceptors are launched based on targeting information from offboard sensor nodes, but the ship’s own radars provide targeting updates in the latter stages of the engagement. HBTSS is also expected to be able to directly cue the radars on Aegis-equipped ships to point in the direction of an incoming threat that is outside of their scan range. This will help them be able to immediately pick it up when it does get within range, in what is called a “cued organic” intercept concept. The planned Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), an effort that supplanted the previous Regional Glide Phase Weapon System (RGPWS) project earlier this year, is expected to be the primary anti-hypersonic interceptor employed in all of these different engagement concepts. Details about the GPI’s required capabilities are still limited, but MDA has already issued solicitations for proposals from contractors to develop the weapon, which the video says will be capable of “overmatching the speed and agility of hypersonic threats.” A screengrab from the MDA video showing an artist’s conception of a notional GPI., MDA “The Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) is leveraging information from RGPWS to accelerate the development of an operational system for hypersonic missile defense using the proven Aegis platform to provide regional hypersonic missile defense,” MDA also told Aviation Week earlier this year. It remains unclear how, if at all, GPI, and RGPWS before it, may or may not be related to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DAPRA) Glide Breaker hypersonic defense program . MDA also sees the SM-6 missile as offering another option to engage incoming HGVs in the terminal stage of their flight. It first emerged in April that the Agency was eying SM-6 for use in the hypersonic defense role and that it plans to try to knock down a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle surrogate with one of these missiles sometime during the 2024 Fiscal Year, all of which you can read about more here . It is assumed that this plan revolves around the still-in-development enlarged SM-6 Block IB variant , which will be able to reach hypersonic speeds itself. It is also worth noting that MDA is interested in expanding the missile defense capabilities of the SM-6 series, broadly. A test in May that involved a pair of ballistic missile defense-optimized SM-6s, known as SM-6 Dual IIs, fired at a surrogate for a medium-range ballistic missile, notably ended in failure . An SM-6 Block I/IA missile at the moment of launch., USN In addition, while the MDA’s slickly-produced animation shows their vision for a multi-layered hypersonic missile defense system working like clockwork, as already noted, defending against the latest hypersonic glide vehicle technologies is a complex proposition, in reality, to say the least. It also relies heavily on components, especially a dense network of space-based sensors able to reliably spot and track these threats, that have yet to enter service. As already mentioned, the first of the HBTSS satellites is expected to head into orbit in 2023. The current plan is to begin fielding the GPIs sometime in the mid to late-2020s. At the same time, Russia and China , potential American adversaries, have already begun fielding various types of hypersonic weapons and are in the process of developing more . MDA Director Navy Vice Admiral Jon Hill highlighted the threat that boost-glide vehicles and other hypersonic weapons pose to aircraft carriers, specifically, the same notional high-value target in the recent released video, during a Congressional hearing last week. “It’s important that we have that capability [hypersonic defense] now because the hypersonic threat is there now,” he said. “What we want to do is move further back into that trajectory, engage earlier, make the terminal defense even better. And so, the glide phase interceptor is under acceleration in the [Fiscal Year 2022] budget.” Chinese transporter-erector-launchers with mockups of the DF-17 missile, which has a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle at its tip, on parade in 2019., Chinese internet It is for these reasons that MDA is hard at work now on multi-layered defenses, such as the Regional Hypersonic Missile Defense concept. At the same time, defending carriers and other high-value targets from hypersonic threats will be very much riding on the successful development of new sensor and interceptor technology.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 25, 2021",The Army Has Started Fielding Its First New Short Range Air Defense System In Decades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has begun fielding its first new short-range air defense system in decades as the range of potential aerial threats, from traditional fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters to missiles, and especially small drones , has grown. The service announced today that a unit forward deployed in Germany recently received the initial batch of operational Mobile Short Range Air Defense, or M-SHORAD, systems, which are based on the 8×8 Stryker wheeled armored vehicle . The 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, based at Shipton Kaserne in Ansbach, Germany, now has a contingent of M-SHORADs alongside its existing Humvee-based Avenger short-range air defense systems. This battalion, which is assigned to the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), also based in Germany, has already been actively involved in the development and test of this new air defense vehicle, which is the culmination of an Army effort that began in 2018. Two of the Mobile Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) systems now assigned to the 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment in Germany., US Army 5-4th Air Defense Artillery is actually using some of the prototype vehicles to begin establishing its operational capability. The unit expects to receive a total of 32 M-SHORAD systems by September, according to Defense News . “This is truly a testament to our Army’s commitment to increase air and missile defense capability and capacity to the joint force, and especially here in Europe,” Brigadier General Gregory Brady, head of the 10th AAMDC, said in a statement . “The 10th AAMDC is proud to be a part of this Team effort and remains engaged, postured and ready to assure, deter, and defend the maneuver force in an increasingly complex Integrated Air and Missile Defense environment, shoulder to shoulder with our NATO Allies.” The Army initiated what was originally referred to as the Initial Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (IM-SHORAD) program in 2018 and subsequently conducted a shoot-off involving a number of contenders. A proposal from Leonardo DRS, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Italian defense contractor Leonardo, based on the Stryker vehicle, was selected as the winner . In October 2020, General Dynamics Land Systems, which builds the Stryker series, received a contract valued at up to approximately $1.2 billion to integrate Leonardo DRS’s M-SHORAD system onto an unspecified number of the 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles. An initial award of $230 million would go toward the delivery of 28 systems, which, together with four prototype vehicles, will make up the entire fleet that 5-4th Air Defense Artillery is scheduled to get this year. The M-SHORAD system consists primarily of a new turret, as well as associated fire control, power generation, and other components, installed on a Stryker. The turret features a four-round FIM-92 Stinger heat-seeking surface-to-air missile launcher, similar to the ones found on the Avenger system, which you can read more about here , on one side. On the other side, there are two launch rails for millimeter-wave radar-guided AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles. The AGM-114L is in U.S. military service today primarily as an air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weapon , but it has a demonstrated secondary surface-to-air capability against slower-flying threats. An M-SHORAD system undergoes a test in the United States., US Army The turret is also equipped with a 30mm M230 automatic cannon and a 7.62mm M240 machine gun , which can be used against aerial targets or threats on the ground. Lastly, it features a turreted sensor system with electro-optical and infrared cameras for target acquisition and general situational awareness. In addition, four small fixed-position RADA active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radars are position on the vehicle’s rear detect to help spot and track targets. When the Army selected Leonardo DRS as the winner of the IM-SHORAD competition, there were reports that its proposal also included some type of so-called soft-kill system, such as an electronic warfare jammer. RADA’s radars are notably a component of various soft-kill counter-drone systems , including the U.S. Marine Corps’ Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System (LMADIS), which is mounted the Polaris MRZR all-terrain vehicle. Whether the soft-kill capability has been integrated or not, the M-SHORAD system already represents a significant boost in capability over the Avenger, which has no radar system of its own and is armed only with Stingers and a single .50 caliber M3P machine gun. The Stryker platform offered greatly improved mobility and survivability over the Humvee that Avenger systems are mounted on, as well. A Humvee-mounted Avenger short-range air defense system fires a Stinger missile during a training exercise., US Army “There’s really no comparison to anything I’ve operated in my career,” Army Sergeant Andrew Veres, a member of 5-4th Air Defense Artillery said in an official interview. “Everything in these systems is an improvement – the survivability, mobility, dependability, off road ability – it gives us the ability to stay in the fight longer.” The Army is also already looking to complement the M-SHORAD system with a Stryker-mounted laser directed energy weapon for added defense, especially against small drones, as well as incoming missiles, artillery shells and rockets, and mortar projectiles. Protection against these latter threats is typically referred to collectively as Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars, or C-RAM. The service is also looking to link together its short and longer-range air and missile defenses into a comprehensive network that also includes various sensors and leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning. You can learn more about that effort, known as the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), which promises to revolutionize how the service defends against various aerial threats, in detail here . A Stryker wheeled armored vehicle fitted with an experimental laser weapon, painted tan, among other additional systems., US Army Beyond the M-SHORAD’s exact specifications, and the Army’s other future air and missile defense plans, these new vehicles that have arrived in Germany a direct reflection of the Army’s commitment to reestablish its SHORAD capabilities, which were allowed to wither away after the end of the Cold War as the threat of enemy air and missile attacks appeared to largely evaporate. This turned out to be a very short-sighted decision, as The War Zone explored in this past in-depth feature . The prospect of a new major confrontation with Russia after its seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 prompted a resurgence of interest in various traditional conventional capabilities with a particular eye toward future conflicts with potential near-peer adversaries. China has since subsumed Russia as the so-called “ pacing threat ” in this regard. In fact, 5-4th Air Defense Artillery, which was officially activated in its present form in October 2018, was the first dedicated short-range air defense battalion to be stood up in the active component of the Army in nearly 13 years at that point. More than a decade earlier, the service decided that the Army National Guard would become to sole operator of the Avenger system, which had first entered service in 1989. M6 Linebackers , Stinger-armed SHORAD systems based on the tracked Bradley fighting vehicle that had the Army had fielded first in 1998, had all been converted into standard M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV) by 2006. The number of issued shoulder-fired Stingers , a type of weapon also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), was also sharply curtailed. An M6 Linebacker in Iraq in 2005., US Army The service also has a smaller number of land-based versions of the ship-mounted Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS), known as Centurions , which it developed together with the U.S. Navy. However, these are niche, low-density assets primarily used to provide C-RAM defense at fixed facilities overseas rather than more general SHORAD. At the same time, smaller hostile countries, such as Iran and North Korea , and even non-state actors , have increasingly begun to field more capable missile systems. This includes land-based cruise missiles , against which shorter-range point air defenses could be very useful. The use of various kinds of armed drones, including loitering munitions , also known as suicide drones , is surging, too. Swarming technology , which presents additional challenges for air defenders, is proliferating , as well. Even small modified commercial quad and hexcopter-type unmanned systems, loaded with small explosive payloads , represent a very real threat now and is one that is only likely to grow as time goes on. This reality has already has prompted the deployment of Army Avengers to places like Syria and Saudi Arabia. In recent years, the Army has also been developing and fielding new versions of the Stinger with improved proximity fuzes that are better suited to engaging these kinds of small threats. “These small- and medium-sized UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] proliferating across the [area of operations] present a new and complex threat to our forces and those of our partners and allies,” U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), declared to the House Armed Services Committee just this week. “For the first time since the Korean War, we are operating without complete air superiority.” McKenzie, who took command of CENTCOM in 2019, has been sounding this alarm for more than a year now, as have others for far longer, including The War Zone . All told, the arrival of M-SHORAD systems in Germany is the start of the fielding of valuable additional air defense capabilities for U.S. forces in Europe, as well as an important step forward in the establishment of new, more capable short-range air defense capabilities across the service after decades of neglect.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 26, 2020",Air Force Makes Extremely Rare Mention Of Deployment Of RQ-170 Stealth Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has made an extremely unusual decision to publicly disclose a deployment of RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drones sometime in the last six months or so. More than a decade after the service officially acknowledged the existence of this unmanned aircraft, details about its operations remain highly classified. The Air Force’s 432nd Wing at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada quietly revealed the RQ-170 deployment earlier this week. The disclosure was tucked in with other information relating to a visit to Creech by General Mark Kelly and Chief Master Sergeant David Wade, the commander and command chief of Air Combat Command (ACC), respectively. The 432nd conducts training and other non-combat operations inside the United States, as well as combat operations overseas. The Air Force refers to crews conducting missions downrange remotely as being under the direction of the 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) and often describes the Wing collectively as the “432nd Wing/432nd Air Expeditionary Wing.” An RQ-170 Sentinel in a test configuration seen flying out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in 2017., Matthew C. Hartman “Since Kelly’s visit in October, the 432nd AEW has begun flying MQ-9 Reaper sorties out of Romania , successfully deployed and redeployed RQ-170 Sentinel forces, and broke ground on the 25th Attack Group ’s forthcoming headquarters and operations building at Shaw AFB, South Carolina,” the 432nd’s Public Affairs Office wrote in an official news item. “RPAs [remotely piloted aircraft] are meeting the needs of Combatant Commanders today – in both contested and non-contested environments,” Air Force Colonel Stephen Jones, the Wing’s commander, said in a statement. “The wide array of mission sets the MQ-9 and RQ-170 are asked to perform remains our hallmark – we do not shy away from these tough tasks; we remain ready to take them on in all environments.” The Air Force news item did not say where the RQ-170s had deployed or when that deployment took place. While it is known that Sentinels have and continue to operate overseas, we here at The War Zone cannot remember another time in which the service has proactively offered any sort of information about a specific operational deployment of these drones. The vast majority of the official details about the exploits of these unmanned aircraft have been obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), though various reports about their activities have also emerged based on information from anonymous sources. Pictures previously provided to The War Zone of an RQ-170 landing at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, in July 2020., Submission While the exact size of the Sentinel fleet is unknown, there are understood to be between 20 and 30 of these drones in service. At present, only two units are publicly known to operate RQ-170s, the 30th and 44th Reconnaissance Squadrons, both of which are assigned to the 432nd Wing’s 732nd Operations Group. The War Zone was the first to report in-depth on the 44th, which officially stood up on Apr. 1, 2015, and the Air Force only acknowledged last year that the RQ-170 was at least one of the types that it flies. The Air Force is only known, with absolute certainty, to have deployed these stealth drones for operations over four countries, Afghanistan , Pakistan, Iran, and South Korea, as well as out over areas of the Western Pacific flying from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. Based on the known South Korean deployments , it is all but certain that they have flown over, or at least very near, North Korea. These drones are widely understood to have surveilled then-Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, before and during the U.S. raid that led to his death in May 2011, as well. An RQ-170 infamously went down and was subsequently captured in Iran six months later. A picture of what was originally referred to as the Beast of Kandahar in Afghanistan. The name was a reference to repeated sightings of RQ-170s at Kandahar Airfield in that country., Uncredited While we don’t know where this newly revealed deployment may have taken some of the RQ-170s, the general time frame the Air Force has provided may offer some clues. Most notably, concerns were building within the U.S. military and Intelligence Community in late 2020 that Iran or its proxies might seek to mark the first anniversary of the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani with attacks on U.S. interests, or those of its allies and partners, across the Middle East or elsewhere . The U.S. military had killed Soleimani , then head of the Quds Force, the arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) tasked with operations outside the country, in a drone strike outside of Baghdad International Airport in Iraq in January 2020. Just days later, Iran had launched an unprecedented ballistic missile strike aimed at facilities hosting U.S. troops in Iraq. By all accounts, it was a miracle that no U.S. service members, or anyone else, died. As already noted, RQ-170s are known to have been employed over Iran in the past. They would still present a very viable asset for penetrating past that country’s air defenses with a low likelihood of detection to monitor for things like the deployment of ballistic missiles on mobile transporter-erector-launchers or other similar signs of impending strikes. Having the Sentinels on station could have provided additional early warning if any such strikes had come. If the drones had found any such threats, they could have then provided information to help target them and conduct post-strike assessments, as well, should any decision to act have been taken by the U.S. government. We know that the U.S. military was poised to retaliate in January 2020 had any Americans died in the Iranian strikes on targets in Iraq. We also know that the Air Force has at least explored the use of the RQ-170 to conduct bomb damage assessments following strikes from stealthy B-2 bombers . This kind of surveillance would be particularly valuable after strikes on deeply buried targets where high-fidelity assessments would be critical to determining whether the operation was a success or failure. In addition, North Korea, another country the RQ-170 is very likely to have already operated over already. There were reports earlier this year about concerns that the Hermit Kingdom might have been preparing to conduct a major new missile test of some kind and the regime in Pyongyang has also been continuing to expand its nuclear weapons program. While the United States has a number of different means of gathering various types of intelligence about what is happening in North Korea from stand-off distances , RQ-170s would offer a potential way to get closer looks at items of interest, such as a missile test facility. In 2017, there were reports that pointed to the use of an RQ-170, or another similar asset, to conduct persistent surveillance of North Korea’s first test of its Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile. Of course, the RQ-170s could have been sent somewhere completely different, as well. There is certainly no shortage of hotspots around the globe where the United States might be interested in discreetly gathering intelligence. Regardless, the Air Force’s public acknowledgment of a deployment of these drones, which remain some of its most secretive assets, is rare and notable itself.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2021",Everything We Know About North Korea’s New “Strategic” Cruise Missile Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A ground-launched cruise missile, which North Korean media describes as “a strategic weapon of great significance,” has been successfully tested, according to the country’s state media outlet KCNA . The new cruise missile, the latest in a long line of increasingly advanced strategic weapons developed by the North Korean regime, could potentially provide the country with an important new capability, with a low-flying standoff weapon able to strike anywhere in South Korea, and even as far as Japan. In this context, the use of the word “strategic” normally implies the carriage of a nuclear warhead. KCNA reported that several examples of the as yet unidentified cruise missile were tested on both Saturday and Sunday, the first such high-profile missile trials since March when a new tactical short-range ballistic missile was tested. This four-tube TEL was noted in successive military parades last October and in January. It’s been suggested this is associated with a land-attack cruise missile, but the latest tests appeared to involve a different type of TEL, with five tubes., NORTH KOREA STATE MEDIA North Korean state media said the missile flew a distance of 930 miles before coming down in North Korean territorial waters, after a flying time of 126 minutes along “oval and figure-of-eight flight orbits.” Development of the new weapon reportedly took at least two years , but there have been several previous hints that it was close to being tested. According to the KCNA, the weekend’s tests demonstrate the “strategic significance of possessing another effective deterrence means for more reliably guaranteeing the security of our state and strongly containing the military maneuvers of the hostile forces.” A pair of photos published by Rodong Sinmun , the official newspaper of North Korea’s Workers’ Party, show a missile being launched from a five-round truck-mounted transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) as well as the missile in cruise flight. The weapon itself bears a strong similarity to the Russian Kh-55 series cruise missile , especially around the tail section, as well as being broadly similar in configuration to the U.S. Tomahawk . An official photo showing the new cruise missile launched from the five-round TEL., North Korean state media In response to the reported missile tests, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) released the following brief statement : “We are aware of reports of DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] cruise missile launches. We will continue to monitor the situation and are consulting closely with our allies and partners. This activity highlights DPRK’s continuing focus on developing its military program and the threats that poses to its neighbors and the international community. The U.S. commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad.” Meanwhile, in Japan, chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said the government was “concerned” by the reports and that it would continue to work closely with the United States and South Korea to monitor the situation. South Korea, too, said it was analyzing the situation in cooperation with the United States. So far, the reports and photos suggest that the cruise missile is likely intended to have a strategic role, carrying a nuclear warhead. As such, the weapon would be the first of its kind to be developed by North Korea, at least that has been revealed to the public. That same conclusion is put forward by analysts including Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. What is so far unknown is whether North Korea has already developed a nuclear warhead small enough to arm a weapon in this class. Although there have been persistent reports of North Korean efforts to miniaturize its nuclear warheads , producing one that can be accommodated within the relatively small dimensions of a typical cruise missile is not easy. North Korea, in fact, unveiled an apparent intermediate-range land-attack cruise missile during a large-scale military parade last October , and again in January , based on a tractor-trailer configuration. However, the photos released to accompany this weekend’s reported tests reveal a revised, non-articulated TEL vehicle, apparently similar to one that was previously associated with large-caliber guided rockets . This has a different configuration of axles, as well as differences in the launch tubes, of which there are now five rather than four. This five-round TEL, used for a large-caliber artillery rocket, nevertheless shows some similarities with the TEL apparently used in the recent cruise missile tests., NORTH KOREAN STATE MEDIA In January this year, meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced that the country had developed “intermediate-range cruise missiles” during a speech to the Worker’s Party Congress. The announcement of the latest cruise missile tests is especially timely, with a meeting between officials from the United States, South Korea, and Japan to discuss the North Korean nuclear stalemate due to begin in Tokyo. Talks with North Korea about lifting U.S. sanctions in return for nuclear concessions have been stalled since 2019. There is also the possibility that the purported tests at the weekend were scheduled as a response to joint U.S. and South Korean exercises last month. These already led to a predictable outcry from North Korean officials, Kim Yo Jong, deputy-department director of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, describing the drills as “dangerous war exercises” that resulted in “further aggravating the unstable situation.” Another North Korean cruise missile test took place in January, a matter of hours after U.S. President Joe Biden took office. In that case, however, it involved a shorter-range weapon with no apparent nuclear capability and that was reportedly based on the design of the Russian Kh-35 anti-ship missile . Notably, North Korea is not prohibited from developing conventionally armed cruise missiles under United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR). Whether a nuclear-armed cruise missile contravenes UNSCRs is a somewhat moot point, although, as Ankit Panda observes, these should prohibit all types of nuclear-delivery systems. Since the nuclear talks broke down, North Korea has, however, pressed ahead with its nuclear weapons development, with a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) designs unveiled. Furthermore, a report last month from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suggesting that North Korea had restarted a nuclear reactor believed to provide plutonium for its nuclear weapons. In the South, meanwhile, there have also been continued efforts to develop weapons capable of striking the North, albeit without nuclear warheads. Last week, for example, it was reported that South Korea had conducted underwater ejection tests of an SLBM from one of its submarines for the first time. You can read more about that program here . If Pyongyang is indeed developing a nuclear-capable land-attack cruise missile, it would provide an important new capability alongside its ballistic missiles. While cruise missiles are far slower than ballistic missiles, they are easier to transport and conceal and their launch is typically harder to detect. Moreover, depending on the guidance system available, a cruise missile of this type would potentially be able to evade enemy air defenses. Weapons in this class would typically be assigned to attack high-value targets such as air defenses and communications nodes, bridges and dams, plus larger warships, and defense against them is a growing concern for the United States and its allies more generally. In a conflict scenario, the ability to deploy cruise missiles could be used to further saturate an enemy’s defenses, with potentially large salvoes of such weapons arriving unexpectedly from different directions. Further confusion would be sown since it would not be clear whether the cruise missiles were carrying nuclear or conventional warheads. The potential threat posed by large numbers of highly mobile North Korean cruise missiles could also tie up a significant portion of Republic of Korea Air Force assets should the South launch an operation to neutralize them. A view of the new North Korean cruise missile in flight., North Korean state media A cruise missile employed as a means of delivering a nuclear warhead could also have other, particular, advantages for North Korea. To date, one key uncertainty regarding North Korea’s nuclear delivery capability is whether it is able to actually fuse and detonate a nuclear weapon properly as part of the terminal stage of a ballistic missile attack. The very high speeds involved make this a highly complex procedure, a challenge that would be removed when using a cruise missile. Furthermore, the development of a practical land-attack cruise missile design could lend itself to other applications. Most obviously, a cruise missile like this could be adapted for naval or air-launched use. While a ship- or submarine-launched naval derivative of such a weapon seems far more likely, North Korea has, in the past, reportedly also pursued a secretive air-launched land-attack cruise missile program that has examined utilizing air-launched derivatives of naval missiles for its fleet of Il-28 bombers , of which there are around 80, according to Flight International . While the South Korean military does not have any nuclear warheads of its own, its attack plans in case of a war with the North are known to feature the use of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and air-launched weapons. South Korea’s Hyunmoo-3 cruise missile can be fired from ground-based launchers or from sea-based platforms, depending on the version. The longest-range Hyunmoo-3C has a reported range of 930 miles, the same as attributed to the new North Korean missile. While cruise missiles, therefore, are already a feature of the military balance on the Korean peninsula, a nuclear-armed weapon in this category is a new development and could have significant repercussions. Above all, however, it remains to be seen how it will affect the gridlocked nuclear talks with North Korea and how the United States will respond to this latest addition to Pyongyang’s expanding strategic capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 11, 2021",Looking To The Past And Thinking Of The Present As We Reflect On 9/11 And Never Forgetting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is bewildering to think that it has been 18 years since those iconic towers fell and we lost so many of our fellow Americans in such a heinous act. Has it really been nearly two decades? It seems so vivid still, like it just happened a year or two ago. For so many of us, the events of that day are deeply carved into our consciousness forever. One can only imagine what the memories are like for those who were at ground zero or at the Pentagon that day, let alone what it’s like for the families who lost loved ones at those places and on Flight 93. How could it have really been 18 years ago? Although we focus so heavily on what came after the events on that September morning—how our society reacted and how we changed, for better and for worse—it’s also important to remember what things were like before that first plane struck… Before the towers were turned into rubble… Before the memorial benches were installed at the Pentagon… Before the first American heroes of The Global War On Terror proclaimed “let’s roll,” rushed the hijackers, and ended those bastards’ despicable mission before they could kill hundreds more on the ground. The photo at the top of this post does exactly that. It takes us back to an earlier time and it is stuffed with American icons of the era, including those wonderful Twin Towers. In the photo, USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67), also known as the Big John, is seen anchored off of Manhattan, with the Big Apple’s skyline rising in the distance and the World Trade Center towers looking on. Also in the frame is the equally iconic Goodyear Blimp, its metallic envelope matching the big gray towers in the distance. The scene is alive with action and industry. The whole thing just screams “USA!” We are a country that thinks big and does big things—supercarriers, not one but two matching record-breaking skyscrapers, branding blimps—you name it, American ingenuity is truly at the heart of who we are as a nation. The photo reflects that with glee. Here are additional photos from the same moment in time: National Archives National Archives National Archives Big John and so many other ships visited New York for an International Fleet Review in 1986 that was part of the Statue of Liberty Centennial. President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan landed on Big John to deliver remarks with Lady Liberty in the background for the event. National Archives National Archives National Archives These images are one heck of a trip down nostalgia lane, but time moves on, things change, bad things happen to good people, and sometimes the bad guy lands a punch, a big, big punch. 9/11 wasn’t the first time such a thing occurred by any means. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is usually compared to that event the most, but there were other moments in modern American history that were plenty awful and gut-wrenching, too. Case in point is the tweet below that popped up on my feed yesterday. It shows a shattered USS Benjamin Franklin (CV-13), coincidentally known as the Big Ben, limping back to New York after nearly getting sunk in the Pacific and losing so many of her crew. Imagine New Yorkers watching as this ghost of a ship that looked as if it just returned from the fires of hell slowly passing by—a stark reminder of the realities of war far from home. When it comes to 9/11, out of so much bad also came a lot of good. America was united. We were instantly spurred to recall how important it was to remember that we are all part of one big family. We are all in it together. Sure, maybe we disagree a lot, and by all means, we are far from perfect, but we have much more in common than not. We are Americans . As for America’s military, foreign policy, and general geopolitical response following that horrific day, we are still trying to figure it out. Shortly after the attacks, after military operations in Afghanistan kicked off, few would have believed that our brave men and women in uniform would still be there 18 years later, and especially that they would be there under deteriorating security conditions. Let’s be frank—there were many missteps along the way. We let fear get the best of us way too many times. And worst of all, some Americans have since forgotten that we are all on the same team. That cohesion that galvanized us following 9/11 has eroded away. We have let our political differences, and those who stoke and capitalize on them, get the best of us. As I said, we are not perfect. Well, maybe some of us actually are, at least when it comes to selflessness. Like those firefighters and policemen who ran up those stairs, or the rescue workers who worked under horrific conditions at ground zero so that our enemies wouldn’t get to take any more lives from us than they already had. Then there were the construction workers and tradesmen that worked so hard to see that we would eventually have some sort of closure on the events of that day. And what about our heroes in uniform? So many of which paid the ultimate sacrifice or left parts of their bodies in foreign lands. What about those Navy SEALs who were all but certain they were heading out on a one way trip into Pakistan so that they could put a bullet in the brain of the bastard who masterminded the events on that infamous day? All we can say is thank and support them however possible, and I think they understand that. But above all else, we must Never Forget. Andrea Booher/FEMA Archive That term has morphed into something well beyond a catchphrase related to an event that is sometimes too dark to fully comprehend. I think for so many of us, Never Forget has become almost a reflex of sorts—an automatic reaction that instantly fires throughout our minds when 9/11 is mentioned or its imagery is evoked. It is a verbal manifestation of a place cordoned off deep in our consciousness. It’s literally all we need to say to encompass everything that we lost on that day, as well as what we gained in the form of national unity and stories of super-human acts of selflessness in its aftermath. Never Forget is like a mental fireworks display full of emotions, imagery, sounds, places, and ideas, all packed into one crescendo. And above all else, it is a non-physical memorial to those we lost and to their unfathomable bravery. Never Forget may be words, yet at the same time, it is also too much to explain. As we look back, we also must look forward. How can we be a smarter, kinder, more productive nation that adheres to its founding principles with confidence and pride? How can we keep the predatory peddlers of division at bay and remind ourselves that we are bound by so much more than what the 24-hour cable news cycle and political party money machines want us to believe? In an age of skewed perceptions via social media and in a time when only the loudest thugs get the biggest soapboxes, the fact is that these things are only an elaborate illusion. Most people don’t wrap themselves entirely in some political party’s dopey flag or hate their neighbor because they voted for the other guy. Not even close. The best we can do in memory of all those who were lost on that day and in the years that followed due to events related to it, is to make sure it doesn’t take another horrific event like 9/11 to remind us of our common bonds. That, on top of everything else, is why we should Never Forget.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 6, 2020",What 9/11 Was Like For The Only American That Watched It From Space,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the world-changing 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. It is always a solemn occasion that is often fraught with conflicting emotions. It is also typically a time for very personal reflections on the attacks, the immediate aftermath, and the far-reaching impacts that continue to be felt today. Every American who is old enough to remember has a story about where they were when it happened. Only one American, though, former NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson, was not on Earth at the time and bore witness to the tragedy from the International Space Station , not always knowing exactly what was going on. Culbertson shared his recollections about that fateful day with Rich Cooper, the Space Foundation’s Vice President of Communications and co-host of that organization’s Space4U podcast , on the sidelines of the 36th annual Space Symposium , which was held in Colorado Springs, Colorado in August. You can listen to the full 9/11 edition of the Space4U podcast featuring Culbertson here . A picture of New York City taken from the International Space Station in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks., NASA In addition to being a former astronaut, Culbertson is a retired U.S. Navy aviator who served during the Vietnam War and who is also a graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School. Prior military service is not at all uncommon among NASA astronauts . He recently retired as President of the Space Systems Group at Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, but continues to run his own company, Higher Flight LLC, and is also currently a member of the Space Foundation’s Executive Committee. “The 10th was just a regular day. We were preparing to receive a new module,” Culbertson told Cooper to start his story. “And so we’d been going through the checklist for that and making sure that everything was ready on the station for that went through our normal routines, you know, worked out some experiments and, and did some communications with the ground.” At the time, Culbertson was the mission commander of Expedition 3 to the International Space Station (ISS). Of the three individuals on the station, he was the only American. The other two people on board, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, were Russian cosmonauts. This was Culbertson’s third trip into space, having also been part of Space Shuttle missions in 1990 and 1993. The members of Expedition 3 to the ISS, from left to right, Mikhail Tyurin, Frank Culbertson, and Vladimir Dezhurov., NASA “On the 11th, my first task of the day was to, after normal stuff, you know, maintenance and things, was to… conduct physicals, medical physicals on all the crew,” Culbertson recalled. “I was basically the flight surgeon, yeah, the commander and the flight surgeon, but my dad was a physician so I think that justified it.” Culbertson explained to Cooper that, at the time, this medical data was collected every 30 days or so during missions to the ISS. As it turned out, Sept. 11, 2001, was their 30th day in orbit. Frank Culbertson works on the ISS during the Expedition 3 mission., NASA “So the plan was to call the ground on the secure circuit and encrypted circuit, so that, because it was private medical information, and talk to the flight surgeon. Uh, Dr. Steve Hart,” Culbertson said. “And so I called the ground and they finally connected me to him and I said, ‘Hey, Steve, how’s it going?’ And, you know, [I was] ready to give him the information and just catch up.” “Cause he’s a good friend, Steve said, ‘well, Frank, we’re not having a very good day down here on Earth,'” he continued. “And my first thought was there must’ve been an accident or some family member has a problem, or who knows what, but I’m sure he’s gonna tell me, but I was a little leery of what it might be.” When Culbertson first called Hart, two hijacked airliners had already struck the Twin Towers in New York City, while a third had slammed into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. While the two men were on the phone, news broke that a fourth had crashed in Pennsylvania. That aircraft, a Boeing 757 flying that day as United Airlines Flight 93, was the only one not to reach its intended target, which had been the Capitol building in Washington, after passengers overpowered their captors . A satellite image of the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks., Maxar Technologies A satellite image of the area in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed., Maxar Technologies It eventually emerged that these attacks were part of an elaborate plot carried out by the terrorist group Al Qaeda. A total of 2,977 people died. “The other odd thing was I was halfway through Tom Clancy’s A [sic; The] Sum of All Fears on an audiobook. Fabulous book,” Culbertson said, remarking on how surreal it all felt. “I thought, am I in a book? Is this a movie? I mean, is this real? And just kind of fleeting thoughts and as he’s [Hart’s] describing it and, you know, asked a few questions, I call my crewmates in to where we were talking in the laboratory.” “They needed to hear what was going on. And of course, they were very concerned and very serious. Russia had been attacked by terrorists several times in the preceding couple of years,” he noted, adding that 94 Russians died in the World Trade Center towers. “And, uh, you know, we had no idea how widespread this attack was going to be, how many countries might be involved.” Culbertson eventually realized the station’s orbit was taking it over Canada and that the northeastern portion of America, including New York City, would soon be visible. As the ISS continued on its course, some 230 miles above the surface of the Earth, the tragedy came into view. “It actually was Michael’s bedroom window that I was looking out of. And [I] clearly see the smoke rising out of New York, out over Long Island, over the Atlantic,” the former astronaut recalled. “So it made it easy to zoom in with the camera and look at what was happening. And as I zoomed in, a big gray blob, enveloped Southern Manhattan, and it turned out, I found out later, what I was seeing was the second tower come down.” Another picture of the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks taken from the ISS., NASA “To me, it was just explosions. And, and again, you’re 230 miles above the Earth… And traveling at five miles a second. So it’s going away pretty quickly and I stayed focused on it as long as I could,” he continued. “I made some comments and said some words about bringing these people to justice and how much it hurt me to see my country under attack.” The ISS completed one orbit around the Earth every 90 minutes or so. Culbertson, together with Dezhurov and Tyurin, used that time to set up more still and video cameras to be able to get more shots of what happening down below on the next pass. The second time around they also saw smoke coming from Washington, D.C., where the Pentagon had been hit. Culbertson also remarked to Cooper about what they didn’t see. “Almost all of the contrails that are normally a spiderweb over the United States had disappeared because they had grounded all the airplanes,” he explained. “Except for one airplane that I saw streaking across the country, which, for a long time, I thought was Air Force One, trying to get the president back.” One of the U.S. Air Force’s VC-25A presidential aircraft, commonly referred to as Air Force , carrying President George W. Bush and others, was one of the only planes in the sky over America after the attacks. Culbertson says, based on a conversation he subsequently had with a U.S. military pilot who had been flying that day, that he now believes the plane he saw was an “airborne command post” aircraft, possibly an E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) jet, that was diverted from a training mission to “control the fighters on the east coast.” E-4B Nightwatch National Airborne Operations Centers (NAOC), commonly referred to as “ Doomsday Planes ,” were also in the air. President George W. Bush speaks on the phone from Air Force One after the 9/11 terrorist attacks., Eric Draper/George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum Culbertson, along with the Russian cosmonauts on the ISS, continued to get other sporadic updates on the situation over the course of the day and into the next. The day after he wrote a letter with his immediate reactions that NASA subsequently published , along with a second one two days later. “It’s horrible to see smoke pouring from wounds in your own country from such a fantastic vantage point,” he had written. “The dichotomy of being on a spacecraft dedicated to improving life on the earth and watching life being destroyed by such willful, terrible acts is jolting to the psyche, no matter who you are.” It was also on Sept. 12 that he received word of a more personal detail regarding the attacks. Culbertson had attended the Naval Academy with Chic Burlingame, who had also become a naval aviator, and the two had been friends since 1967. On Sept. 11, Burlingame had been the pilot of American Airlines Flight 77, the Boeing 757 that smashed into the Pentagon. “We played the drum and bugle Corps together. We both were trying to fly the F-4 Phantom at the same time,” Culbertson said. “And we’d known each other since 1967. And so it became very personal.” With no one really knowing at that point whether the 9/11 attacks were a singular incident or the start of something broader, Culbertson’s remarks to Cooper seem to suggest that speculation about what might happen next was rife. Don Pettit, one of the individuals supporting Expedition 3 back on Earth, decided to send an Email about the potential for a ballistic missile attack on the ISS. “He sent me an email and said, ‘Hey Frank, I just want you to know I’ve done the calculations and they actually could hit you with a Scud missile if they got lucky, because they can get to that altitude. It’s not guided, but you know, they might get lucky,'” Culbertson recalled. “And I said, ‘thanks for [that] Don. Thanks a lot for that.’… I gave him grief about that when I got back.” The Space Foundation’s Cooper also pointed out that astronauts often do remote engagements with schools and others in the community from the ISS. Culbertson said that he was scheduled to do a number of these kinds of events beforehand. In November, before coming back, he had spoken to kids from a public school just blocks from Ground Zero in New York City. “They had to change schools three times over the next week because of all the rescue and recovery operations that were going on,” he remembered, adding that it was not clear if it was going to be possible to make contact with them in the end. “I did make contact with the, with the school, answered their questions as thoroughly as I could.” Expeditionary 3 to the ISS ultimately ended, as scheduled, on Dec. 15, 2001. Culbertson, Dezhurov, and Mikhail Tyurin all made it safely back to Earth. By that point, personnel from the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. Army Special Forces units had already moved into Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda had its main base of operations. Providing local groups with American airpower and other resources, they had helped unseat the nominal government in the country at the time, led by the Taliban, before the year was out. The Taliban have, of course, just returned to power after the stunningly collapse of the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan amid the planned withdrawal of American troops after nearly two decades, which subsequently turned into a controversially chaotic and deadly evacuation mission . The group now looks set to announce the formal establishment of its new government on Sept. 11, which will only add a new layer to the many emotions that the anniversary always stirs up. For Culbertson, he came back to an Earth that was already shifting in monumental ways. “I was prepared for it. I mean, people have been sending me pictures and descriptions of what had happened in the days and weeks afterwards, and what changes have been made in security and with the airports, et cetera, and how a lot of things just weren’t accessible anymore,” he explained. Still, “we did, we did come back to a different world and as we reacclimated and, you know, had to travel around the country around the world to, you know, for post-flight or to do our business or go anywhere. We saw it clearly. So for us, it was a big change.” Frank Culbertson gives two thumbs up around the start of Expedition 3 to the ISS in August 2001., NASA “The, the events of … this past week in Afghanistan remind us of how fragile peace can be and how fragile our nation and civilization and constancy can be, if we don’t maintain security the way we should,” Culbertson further told Cooper in a concluding statement on the podcast. “So I’m concerned about where things are going right now and whether anything else will happen.” “We need to value those freedoms, as well as value our security, and pay attention, as things change around the world,” he added. “By the same token, when you accomplish great things together, as international partners, it strengthens all the countries involved and sets a good example for how people should, should behave.” Though this year’s 9/11 anniversary does seem to come at a time of particular uncertainty in many respects around the world, we here at The War Zone are certainly grateful that Culbertson has been willing and able to share his unique perspective on the infamous moment in human history. These kinds of very personnel recollections are key to ensuring that, whatever the future might hold, no one forgets what happened on that terrible day.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter has recorded its first official fleet mission, completing the real-world retrieval of another helicopter from a mountain ridge, and marking a significant step forward for the program. While the rotorcraft, which has faced its fair share of problems in the past, is still undergoing operational assessment, the CH-53K recently undertook the mission over the course of September 4-5, although full details, and the photos seen in this feature, were released yesterday. The King Stallion was assigned the recovery of a U.S. Navy MH-60S Seahawk helicopter that made a hard landing on a high-altitude ridge amid rugged terrain on Mount Hogue, near Bishop, California, close to the Nevada border. The Seahawk, assigned to the Naval Air Station Fallon Base Flight, at the Nevada base, had come down during a search-and-rescue operation for a lost hiker on July 16. No injuries were reported to its four crew, who were rescued the following day. As for the hiker, they were found by authorities four days after being posted missing.

Therese Edwards “VMX-1 [Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron 1] received a request for assistance from the Naval Safety Center about an MH-60S that suffered a hard landing near Mount Hogue, California, at an elevation of 12,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) in July,” said Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Luke Frank, the CH-53K Detachment Officer in Charge for VMX-1. After assessing recovery options provided by the Army National Guard, Navy, and Marine Corps fleet squadrons, the MH-60S unit and the Naval Safety Center turned to the King Stallion. “They all lacked the capability to lift the aircraft without an extensive disassembly,” Frank explained. “After two weeks of exhaustive planning and assembling a team of more than 25 Marines and sailors from VMX-1 and 1st Landing Support Battalion from Camp Pendleton, California, we deployed two CH-53Ks to Bishop, California, and got to work,” Frank continued. The roughly 15,200-pound MH-60S was then partially disassembled and prepared for transport back to Bishop as an underslung load, a fundamental airlift capability that the CH-53K will provide the Marine Corps once it’s in full operational service. The King Stallion’s CH-53E Super Stallion predecessor is also able to lift an H-60 series rotorcraft as a slung load, but the CH-53K offers significant advantages when carrying heavy loads at higher altitudes and in hotter environments. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Colton Brownlee U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Colton Brownlee “After six months of flight operations with the CH-53K, the detachment had every confidence in the aircraft’s abilities to conduct the mission safely. Our main concern was the environmental factors ground support personnel would have to endure,” said Frank. “This is exactly what the K is made to do,” Frank said. “Heavy lift is a unique and invaluable mission for the Marine Corps. Horsepower is our weapon system and the CH-53K is armed to the teeth. The entire team of Marines at VMX-1, 1st Landing Support Battalion, and NAS Fallon Search and Rescue were extremely motivated to execute this mission and we are all very proud to have completed this one flawlessly. To be the first group of professionals to complete a real-world, heavy lift/high altitude mission in support of a unit who thought all options were off the table is extremely rewarding.” U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Colton Brownlee U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards VMX-1 is currently involved in proving out the type for frontline service at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California. That process has so far run into some difficulties. Some of these were detailed in the most recent annual Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) report. In March, the U.S. Navy — responsible for managing the CH-53K program on behalf of the Marine Corps — confirmed to The War Zone that the helicopter was prohibited from flying in dust clouds or so-called brownout conditions, with particular concerns about engine performance in these circumstances. You can read our full account of that issue and its implications in this previous article . U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards The problem of engine performance degradation in brownout conditions has particular relevance to the type of external cargo operations that were demonstrated recently with the Seahawk recovery. With a limit of 70 seconds of exposure to brownout during a given maneuver, “CH-53K aircrew cannot realistically perform external cargo delivery operations,” the DOT&E report noted. Not only is the movement of underslung loads critical to the CH-53K’s ability to fly its core missions, but the helicopter will be expected to fly routinely in brownout conditions of the type that have characterized rotary operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards As for its prodigious slung-load capability, the CH-53K is outfitted with a new external cargo system with three independent hooks for optional single-, dual- or triple-load operations. Unlike the CH-53E, therefore, the King Stallion will, ultimately, be able to deliver three different loads to three different locations in the course of a single sortie. “Planners and decision-makers will embrace a new era of capability that allows the quick massing of combat power, agile maneuver, resilient logistics, and predictive maintenance, all under the unifying theme of multi-domain attack,” the latest Marine Aviation Plan, released in 2019, explains. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards Whether the issues with moving slung loads in brownout conditions has now been addressed, or whether the Mount Hogue recovery did not entail flying in these conditions, is not immediately clear, but The War Zone has reached out to NAVAIR for further comment. Back in March, the Navy confirmed that “The CH-53K will continue engineering investigation, ground testing and flight test in sand and dust in order to safely expand the operational envelope.” U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards However, the engine problem in brownout conditions is only one of the issues that have beset the CH-53K program. Although a first CH-53K was delivered to the Marines in May 2018, it soon became clear that the expected date for the service to reach initial operational capability (IOC) with the type would be delayed. This was the result of problems including ingestion of exhaust gasses into the engines, deficiencies with the main drive shaft and tail rotor assemblies, and main rotor gearboxes that were prone to failure. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards The engine and gearbox issues were resolved in fairly short order, but IOC is still not expected until Fiscal Year 2024, according to the 2019 Marine Aviation Plan, although that could move forward depending on the progress made with the ongoing initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) with VMX-1. At one point, the Marine Corps expected the CH-53K to achieve IOC in 2015, before that was pushed back until 2019, in part due to the aforementioned gearbox issues. At the same time, the costs involved in the CH-53K have continued to rise alarmingly, with the Pentagon 2021 Fiscal Year budget request outlining a unit cost of around $125 million. The Marine Corps plans to buy at least 200 examples of the King Stallion but, although the service still has a formal requirement to ultimately acquire 220 of these helicopters, it has also considered reducing the overall total , on cost grounds. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Therese Edwards U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Colton Brownlee In the meantime, the Marines and Navy are progressively gaining more experience with the King Stallion in representative operating environments. In June last year, an example went aboard the USS Wasp (LHD-1), for the first at-sea trials on one of the Navy’s big-deck amphibious assault ships. U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Colton Brownlee U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Colton Brownlee The CH-53K has also won a long-sought first export order, Israel choosing to replace its aging fleet of legacy S-65/CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters with the decision to buy the new rotorcraft approved by the Israeli Ministry of Defense in February this year. The King Stallion won out against the Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Washington has approved the sale of 18 examples . That the Navy and Marine Corps now consider the CH-53K ready for a real-world mission, albeit one in their backyard, is significant, especially bearing in mind the setbacks that have dogged the program so far, and led to some lengthy delays. The King Stallion may still be some way away from IOC, let alone full operational capability, but tasks such as the retrieval of the MH-60S from Mount Hogue will only help build confidence in a program that, for the Marine Corps and the U.S. armed forces at large, represents a vital vertical-lift asset.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 2, 2021",Bell’s Plan To Finally Realize A Rotorcraft That Flies Like A Jet But Hovers Like A Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Bell has provided The War Zone with exclusive details about its recently revealed concepts for future High-Speed Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or HSVTOL, aircraft, which we looked at initially in this previous article . While being able to takeoff and land vertically using rotors and fly at jet speeds in forward flight sounds far-fetched, it turns out that there is decades of elaborate risk reduction work and general research already done on this exact concept. As such, actually realizing such a capability set may be far less of a technological revolution than one would think at first glance. The War Zone sat down, virtually at least, with Jeff Nissen, Senior Manager Advanced Technology at Bell Flight, to talk about how the company has got to this point in its HSVTOL endeavors, as well as looking at some of the details of its latest concepts and how they could find a place in the U.S. military’s inventory. Bell’s latest three HSVTOL concepts are progressively larger, beginning with the smallest, known as HSVTOL Light, which is unmanned and scaling up to a roughly C-130-size transport. The V-22 Ospreys, as well as the MC-130H in the background, may provide pointers to the future roles envisaged for the mature versions of these HSVTOL concepts., Bell At this point, it’s worth noting that the ‘high speed’ definition, as described by Bell, is anything over 400 knots. This is considered the barrier to entry for HSVTOL, and the company is of the opinion that any requirement that involves a speed lower than this would be better met by a conventional tiltrotor . Generally speaking, HSVTOL, especially Bell’s vision of it, uses rotors for the vertical terminal phases of flight and a jet engine with traditional exhaust for high-speed flight. A mature HSVTOL design would be optimized for high cruise efficiency, although, as Nissen notes, anything over Mach 0.85 is likely to present major drag problems. While it’s theoretically possible to continue to add thrust to the design, that would impose a corresponding reduction in fuel efficiency, so a balance has to be struck. “You’re going to want range and speed, so would not want afterburners on this aircraft,” Nissen explains. The long journey toward HSVTOL When examining the stealthy-looking HSVTOL concepts that Bell unveiled last month, it’s also important to remember that the quest for these kinds of aircraft — combining the speed and survivability of a fixed-wing jet aircraft with the ability to land and take off like a helicopter — dates back to the late 1960s. At that time, the Vietnam War exposed a very real requirement for a more survivable platform that would be able to take over the U.S. Air Force’s combat search and rescue mission set, as well as other personnel recovery activities, from traditional helicopters. An HSVTOL design would be expected to fly into a potentially contested area at high speed, landing in a confined space or hovering over the jungle to pluck a downed airman from out of harm’s way. Other missions at the time called for a similar type of capability, including retrieving Apollo command modules on behalf of NASA, another job that fell to conventional rotorcraft. Other services, too, took an interest in HSVTOL around about the same time. This included the U.S. Army, which no doubt eyed the unique special operations possibilities provided by an aircraft of this type and the ability to rapidly insert or extract small teams of soldiers, potentially from behind enemy lines, over great distances. As it turned out, a whole host of manufacturers, including Bell, came up with HSVTOL concepts between the 1960s and the 1990s, picking their favorite configurations that combined vertical lift with high-speed forward flight. From these very early concepts onward, a key design challenge has been the transition between vertical and cruise flight. Or, more concretely, what to do with the rotor blades when they are not being used? Even early on, designers of HSVTOL concepts typically conceived of designs in which helicopter-style rotor blades either folded back to reduce their aerodynamic profile, trailing behind the aircraft, or were otherwise stowed away conformally within the fuselage or engine nacelles. A folding blade arrangement is seen on Bell’s latest HSVTOL concepts, too. A late 1960s design study for a folding tiltrotor rescue/transport aircraft. The rotor blades, attached to hubs on the wingtips, are depicted folded back in a stowed position., ICAS By the 1970s, U.S. aviation companies had begun to actually develop hardware to prove some of these concepts. Bell, for its part, eventually came up with a full-size, ground-based demonstrator, with a 26-foot diameter rotor arrangement, the blades of which retracted neatly away to lie flush around the nacelle. This testbed explored how the rotors behaved in the tricky transition between vertical and high-speed horizontal flight, including how the rotor would be stopped, and how it would avoid buffeting or vibration while it was being tucked away, at the same time that the aircraft itself was accelerating to cruising speed. There are decades worth of various folding-blade HSVTOL concepts., Bell A rendering of a HSVTOL concept for pilot recovery from the Vietnam War era., Public Domain Ultimately, Bell proved that the rotor-fold problem could be solved aero-mechanically (using airflow alone), and that it was possible to wind up or wind down a rotor without causing dynamic instability in the system. In a 1972 test in a wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center in California, the company demonstrated between 30 and 40 fold-and-unfold cycles at airspeeds ranging from 150 to 175 knots. The Bell folding rotor in the wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center., NASA At around the same time, the Air Force was again looking at the possibilities for a future Combat Aircrew Rescue Aircraft (CARA), further prompting Bell and others’ efforts in the HSVTOL realm. Even at this early stage, the Air Force rescue specialists were eyeing a design that would be smaller than the existing HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giant , have a minimum cruise speed of 400 knots, have hostile ground fire detection capability, an electronic countermeasure suite, and be equipped with terrain following/terrain avoidance radar . In the event, the service stuck to more conventional rotorcraft solutions for this kind of mission, while the end of the conflict in Southeast Asia meant personnel recovery lost some of its priority. A U.S. Air Force HH-53C hoists a rescuee into the side door from the jungle below., U.S. Air Force Nevertheless, technological boundaries continued to be pushed, now focusing on how to best power an aircraft that required two distinct propulsion forms: a jet engine for high-speed flight and shaft-driven rotors for vertical flight. One answer seemed to be a convertible engine, a type of powerplant that can switch between turboshaft and turbofan modes, eliminating the need for separate lift and cruise engines. New propulsion, more challenges In 1984, General Electric ran one of its TF34 turbofans — as used in the A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack jet and S-3 Viking anti-submarine warfare aircraft — in a convertible configuration , producing a full-scale prototype that provided shaft horsepower from the front, and turbofan thrust coming out of the rear. It was a bold effort, but the stark reality was that convertible jet engines were very hard to master. Indeed, Bell today anticipates that the first of its new HSVTOL designs will fly with separate lift and cruise engines, pending the arrival of truly mature convertible engines for more ambitious concepts. A TF34 being used in convertible engine tests during the 1980s. , NASA It’s also worth noting that following the tragic failure of Operation Eagle Claw at the Desert One austere landing zone in Iran, the U.S. military, and the special operations community, in particular, put a whole new emphasis on higher-speed VTOL aircraft. This included capabilities like what the V-22 Osprey could offer and more ambitious, higher-speed designs, as well. A shipborne folding-rotor HSVTOL concept from the 1980s., Public Domain By the 1990s, the Osprey had entered flight testing as the first practical military tiltrotor aircraft, but U.S. plane-makers were still not able to field a functional HSVTOL design capable of true jet speeds. Nevertheless, studies and development initiatives continued in the decade that followed, with NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) now taking a lead. Concept art of the fighter-like Bell-Boeing offering for the Army’s Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program in the 1980s, which featured a folding rotor system very similar to what is being proposed today., Bell-Boeing Then, in 2008-09 there was NASA’s VTOL X-Plane competition, won by the Aurora XV-24 LightningStrike . Hybrid-powered ducted electric fans were used for propulsion with this concept. Although it ended up getting canceled, it once again demonstrated the enduring interest in HSVTOL. All this historical effort, or what Bell’s Nissen describes as a “trail of tears,” resulted in nothing tangible entering service, or even getting close to it, despite the great promise that had been demonstrated, in some cases using real hardware. So what went wrong? Nissen points to three particular aspects that, so far, have prevented a full-size HSVTOL design from being realized. First, the vertical-lift system is, by its nature, highly complex. Many of the earlier concepts were being put together before any kind of tiltrotor aircraft was even close to being in operational service. Simply put, it was not realistic for HSVTOL to leapfrog conventional tiltrotor designs, which already had enough quirks and nuances of their own. After all, when the first generation of HSVTOL studies was being drafted, the experimental XV-15 tiltrotor aircraft had not even begun to fly test sorties, with those flights starting in 1977. The U.S. Marine Corps’ MV-22B Osprey would not reach initial operational capability until three decades later. The Bell XV-15 tiltrotor aircraft in vertical flight at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, where it was tested in 1980 and 1981., NASA The second factor was that the digital engine control technology required for HSVTOL to be feasible, and safe, was simply not widely available until the 1980s, at the earliest. Finally, the transition between cruise and lift modes demanded fly-by-wire controls, another technology that was in its infancy when the first HSVTOL concepts were being schemed. For this reason, tiltrotor aircraft were not a truly practical proposition for large-scale service in the 1970s or 1980s, much less the more demanding HSVTOL designs. Bell’s latest concepts Now, however, the dream of HSVTOL aircraft is within reach, at least according to Bell. That is even without a mature convertible engine but, as Nissen points out, that shouldn’t prevent the company from bringing at least a first iteration of its new HSVTOL concepts to the flight demonstration stage. A graphic from a 2013 Department of Defense/Defense Science Board report showing the aspiration to field much faster vertical-lift platforms by 2030., DoD As suggested by the company’s initial computer-generated artwork, Bell’s latest three HSVTOL concepts are all different sizes, scaling from the smallest, known as HSVTOL Light, all the way up to a transport that appears to be close to the size of a C-130 airlifter . A computer-generated image of the medium-size Bell HSVTOL concept carrying out a personnel recovery mission over the sea., Bell While Bell’s larger two concepts are manned, the HSVTOL Light concept is unmanned and is being pitched as the most easily realizable ‘entry-level’ HSVTOL design. HSVTOL Light has two separate, commercially available engines—turboshaft to drive the props and a jet to propel the aircraft in forward flight—unlike its two larger cousins, which feature convertible powerplants. This configuration was chosen for the smaller vehicle, Nissen says, because it offers a faster path to flight test and possible service, with no requirement for an engine development period. “We can achieve a pretty damn good aircraft with a configuration that’s got a split propulsion,” Nissen adds. In fact, “we can build that right now,” he says. “If somebody wants to see this fly as fast as possible, and doesn’t want to wait for a convertible engine, there’s a great opportunity to go with that aircraft.” SLURRP: HSVTOL goes sea-based HSVTOL Light is being proposed as part of what Bell calls the Sea-based Logistics Unmanned Refuel/Re-arm Platform, or SLURRP. This is tailored for the Air Force’s emerging concept of expeditionary operations , especially in the Pacific theater . It involves operating the autonomous HSVTOL Light from an unmanned floating platform that is capable of refueling the aircraft. A notional depiction of Bell’s SLURRP concept., Bell As well as the Air Force’s high interest in this theater, the concept clearly also has relevance to the U.S. Marine Corps’ emerging plans for Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO), which similarly seek to exploit the potential of distributed and expeditionary operations, especially in this region. A Marine Corps concept from circa 2016 for a floating base envisaged as part of the EABO concept, in this case supporting V-22 Osprey tiltrotors, as well as providing a platform for an electromagnetic railgun., U.S. Marine Corps “What [SLURRP] does is that shrinks the Pacific ranges dramatically so we don’t have to have a Navy vessel for a refueling platform and we also don’t need a stealth tanker because we can literally have these things dotting the ocean surface or being submerged and pop up when they’re needed,” Nissen explains. Nissen says that when it comes to HSVTOL, the company’s mantra is “speed, range, and survivability,” attributes that clearly play into the Air Force’s vision of future warfare in the Pacific environment, especially when it includes moving away from traditional runways . It’s easy to imagine HSVTOL Light flying intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), or even strike missions as part of this distributed concept of operations, breaking entirely free from reliance on runways, traditional landing sites, or even warship decks to offer an exceptional level of survivability. Doing so would also drastically complicate an adversary’s own defensive plans. The video posted above also shows the neat method used for HSVTOL Light’s transition from vertical to horizontal flight, with the rotor blades folding back into the nacelles using airflow alone, with no requirement for complex mechanical braking and powered folding mechanisms. Nissen says that the company has been working hard to make this transition as seamless as possible and has been looking at lightweight concepts that employ either no clutch at all, or a very light clutch, and require no braking system. SLURRP team in action. A swarm of unmanned HSVTOL Light drones takes flight from at-sea refueling platforms in this Bell concept art., Bell Once flying in ‘jet aircraft’ mode, with rotors stowed, the HSVTOL Light, and the other HSVTOL concepts, would offer greater maneuverability than a traditional tiltrotor, although the degree of agility would be based primarily on the particular customer’s needs. A conventional tiltrotor is stressed for maneuvers in the region of 2.5G. Nissen says that while the HSVTOL is “not going to be a 9G aircraft, we will fly these at low altitude, the way AFSOC [Air Force Special Operations Command] does business. We are a jet that’s capable of flying with an F-35 at 30,000 feet as well as flying at 100 feet at a similar speed. If there’s a big hill up front and we’re doing 400 knots, we’re going to need a high-G aircraft to maneuver. We would have terrain-following radar to help us, in that scenario,” he adds. The special operations modified CV-22 also relieves on terrain-following radar for very low-altitude penetration operations, but it flies much slower than HSVTOL aircraft would, making it require less structural G-loading capacity. , USAF As for the other, larger variants, the company decided that once the light concept is developed, a convertible engine becomes increasingly beneficial. Ultimately, Nissen says, off-the-shelf turboshafts, required to drive the rotors, ‘scale out’ at around 7,000 horsepower, so any aircraft with a greater power requirement will need another solution. The type of convertible engine in mind is essentially similar, in concept, to the aforementioned GE TF34 testbed, in which a core would be taken from an existing, mature engine and then adapted to drive a shaft that could power the rotors when needed. The Pratt & Whitney F135 turbofan that’s already coupled with a lift-fan in the F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter jet is one possibility for adaptation. “The simplistic way would be to imagine that lift system, instead of facing down, faces aft and now you’ve got a capability that provides jet thrust and shaft horsepower,” Nissen explains. The challenge in this case, however, is that the weight and fuel efficiency of the F135 is not ideal for an HSVTOL design. To get the required efficiency, a high-bypass solution would be required. Of course, it is possible that the F135 core and drivetrain could be adapted to a higher-bypass variant with a wider diameter. A mockup of the F-35B propulsion system which includes its Rolls-Royce lift-fan driven via a shaft connected to the Pratt & Whitney F135 turbofan. This is more or less a convertible engine arrangement. , Duch.seb/wikicommons A hybrid-electric power source, combining electrical rotor propulsion with a conventional powerplant, is another possibility, but it’s still a long way off, Nissen reckons, and would come with plenty of extra complexity and technological risk. In Bell’s studies, current hybrid propulsion is suitable only for aircraft of “very, very low gross weights,” in the “several thousand pounds class.” A hybrid engine also imposes an even greater weight penalty than a traditional shafted system. Anything over 300 horsepower, Nissen contends, will currently provide a power-to-weight ratio that’s “pretty miserable.” For the HSVTOL concepts, the engine power starting point is 1,000 horsepower, while today’s V-22 engine develops 6,000 horsepower and provides a power-to-weight ratio that is “extremely hard to beat.” With that in mind, a conventional turbine engine, adapted for convertible operations, is likely to be the powerplant of choice for the larger HSVTOL designs. The three different sizes of Bell HSVTOL concept as currently envisaged., Bell Clearly, all three of Bell’s HSVTOL concepts involve a degree of low observability (LO), or stealthy design features, although this is seen as just one facet of a design that’s tailored for survival in a contested environment. As well as flying low, the aircraft would be designed to be “more survivable from a signature standpoint,” with infrared and noise suppression features incorporated from the outset. Unlike a stealthy fighter, of course, an HSVTOL aircraft would be required to spend time at lower speeds over the ground, or at least in the hover, while in hostile environments, demanding full-spectrum survivability. Electronic and infrared countermeasures that are incorporated in a defensive suite would also be a key feature. Nevertheless, “with your rotors stowed in cruise mode, you have a signature that is much less than any other rotorcraft ever produced, by a long shot,” Nissen says. “You’re not going to compete with aircraft that are designed to be very LO [low observable/stealth] but you’re going to be somewhere in between. You’re going to be capable of getting places that you wouldn’t necessarily get to.” Then, once entering the vulnerability period on approach into the terminal area, the HSVTOL aircraft would be expected to maneuver or counter potential threats, too. As Nissen observes, “LO-looking shapes are not enough — you need other tricks for total mission survivability.” Combat search and rescue and beyond The HSVTOL concepts, and the medium-size HSVTOL aircraft, in particular, would seem tailored for Air Force Special Operations Command’s personnel recovery mission set, currently provided by the CV-22B Osprey tiltrotor , for which the command is now already starting to look for a successor . Nissen says that there is potential beyond AFSOC, however, with Air Combat Command likely to require a future “a shooter and recovery aircraft” to fulfill its combat search and rescue requirements . In this way, it could be envisaged that the unmanned HSVTOL Light could serve as an armed escort for the manned medium-size HSVTOL platform, helping it to access more-contested areas. Speed, range, and low-observable features would also allow Air Force combat search and rescue (CSAR) crews to access areas they either cannot right now or can’t without taking on extreme risk. This is an especially troubling issue we have raised many times before due to the expansion of stealthy aircraft across the Air Force’s combat fleet and the proliferation of more advanced air defense systems around the globe. If an F-35 or B-21 couldn’t survive in a hostile area, how is an HH-60 going to? Considering the ranges likely involved with future air combat operations, these traditional rotary-wing assets won’t even be able to reach the areas where combat missions are being flown by stealthy aircraft in the first place. Also, speed alone is incredibly valuable with CSAR. So, HSVTOL could become not just a tactical luxury, but a necessity. The USAF just invested billions in updated HH-60W Jolly Green II helicopters to recap its CSAR fleet, but how useful these would be in a peer state conflict is highly debatable. , USAF It is also worth mentioning that with every minute that goes by before a heliborne rescue of a down pilot occurs means there is less of a chance of a successful outcome. Speed is literally of the essence when it comes to CSAR. While a V-22 offers a big leap in capability in this regard, HSVTOL offers a drastic leap beyond that. Then there are emerging requirements for high-speed tactical mobility, as well as ISR and strike, across the services. The reason for the three HSVTOL concepts, Nissen says, is in response to “a lot of interest in tactical mobility.” Notably, the largest HSVTOL concept in Bell’s artwork wears a US Air Force tail flash of the kind typically used on the service’s cargo aircraft, as well as aerial refueling tankers. Not only is HSVTOL Light the lowest barrier for entry in this class, meaning it will take the least time and financial effort to develop, but it’s also of a size that has potential relevance to a number of current unmanned initiatives. These include the Marine Corps’ MUX requirement , calling for a drone that will be able to take off from and land vertically on the deck of an amphibious assault ship, as well as the Air Force’s Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology program, or LCAAT. Then there’s the same service’s Skyborg program , which is all about inserting an artificial intelligence-driven ‘computer brain’ into drones. HSVTOL Light could feasibly provide a unique platform for these unmanned endeavors and more. The Bell V-247 Vigilant has been pitched in the past as suitable for the Marine Corps MUX project. An HSVTOL design would also seem eminently suitable for the same requirement., Bell As for the larger HSVTOL concept, the roughly Hercules-sized design, this could offer the U.S. military the type of high-speed, vertical-lift stealthy transport that it has long sought, in particular for the special operations role. The sage behind the desire for a low-observable transport of the kind that could, for example, evade enemy air defenses before placing a small team of operators deep within enemy-held or contested territory is one that The War Zone has examined deeply in the past, here and here . Even offering runway independence to “big Air Force” for some of its tactical airlift needs could be quite enticing considering the realities of expeditionary operations in the Pacific or really anywhere that enemies have the ability to neuter airfields over long distances. Regardless, the next major step is to build and test a technology demonstrator based around a smaller-scale airframe, the timeline for which is dependent on who might come forward to back Bell’s concept. “We’ll take anybody and everybody,” Nissen says, although the Air Force, NASA, or DARPA would be likely candidates. “As soon as you get that thing to flight, then it’s more about the services’ acquisition timeline,” Nissen says. At that point, we might start to see broader interest in HSVTOL designs for both the established personnel recovery mission, but potentially for many other applications too. That, of course, would be a ways off, but the feeling at Bell is that they are now close to finally cracking the challenge of a truly feasible HSVTOL aircraft, and the company could be well-positioned to write the next chapter of an endeavor that began back in the late 1960s.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Out of all the bizarre-looking testbed aircraft whizzing around these days, Northrop Grumman’s two Bombardier CRJ-700 surrogate test platform aircraft seem to get the most attention. Whenever they show up somewhere, my DMs start filling up with “WHAT IS THIS?!” type of inquiries. It seems that their owner likes to keep tight-lipped about most of the development work that they do, but just today they put out a press release talking about some of their latest exploits, along with the great picture above showcasing the type’s remarkable adaptability. Many types of aircraft have been turned into testbeds over the decades and fitted with all types of radomes and sensor systems. For instance, Raytheon’s “Voodoo1” Boeing 727 test platform continues to be one of the company’s most valuable assets . The Boeing 757 “Catfish” testbed used for F-22 Raptor stealth fighter avionics development continues to fly to this very day and has even been knocked off by China . Northrop Grumman has an array of types to accomplish these functions, including Gulfstream business jets , but its two CRJ-700s really seem to get around these days. N804X, one of Northrop Grumman’s two modified Bombardier CRJ-700s, carrying the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye radar pod on its ventral hardpoint., Tomás Del Coro/Wikicommons The two jets, which carry the U.S. civil registration codes N804X and N805X, were developed about a decade ago and often take part in major Large Force Employment (LFE) testing events , working as surrogate platforms for systems and weapons that will eventually find their way on tactical aircraft. Testing those systems in real-world conditions via a flying laboratory is highly beneficial not just for ironing out bugs, but for making the system and its concept of operations and employment even better than promised, as well as finding new ways to leverage their capabilities. This was precisely the case during this year’s iteration of Exercise Northern Lightning in August where one of Northrop Grumman’s CRJ testbeds sported the F-16’s new AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) as it was put through the paces to prove that it can operate with one of the company’s new electronic warfare systems. The press release about this milestone reads in part: In August, a Northrop Grumman test bed aircraft (pictured) flew with the company’s F-16 Next Generation Electronic Warfare and AN/APG-83 SABR systems in a dense electromagnetic spectrum environment at the Northern Lightning joint training exercise. (Northrop Grumman photo) “When an EW system and a radar are able to work together fully, as demonstrated with NGEW and SABR, pilots can take advantage of capability without compromise,” said James Conroy, vice president, navigation, targeting and survivability, Northrop Grumman. “With the radio frequency (RF) spectrum becoming increasingly contested, this critical set of capabilities will support the F-16 for many years to come.” Flying on the company’s test bed aircraft, NGEW and SABR demonstrated full pulse-to-pulse, multi-function interoperability in a contested operational environment. With SABR successfully engaging multiple air and ground targets, NGEW detected and identified a range of advanced threats, employing advanced jamming techniques capable of defeating those threats when required. At the exercise, the two systems faced a high-density radio frequency environment generated by the Volk Field Combat Readiness Training Center, Joint Threat Emitters. These threat emitters allowed Northern Lightning participants to fly missions under conditions representative of near-peer electromagnetic spectrum environments. NGEW leverages an open-systems, ultra-wideband architecture, providing the instantaneous bandwidth needed to defeat modern threats. This F-16 system is part of a mature product line of electronic warfare capabilities that can be adapted to virtually any platform. An F-16 will fly with the safety of flight-certified NGEW system in the summer of 2022. You can read all about SABR in these past features of ours linked here and here . A source familiar with testbed flight operations tells The War Zone that “no matter what they tell you, you can only do so much in simulation. It is its own thing. That isn’t going to change anytime soon even though simulations are becoming better. The same is true for lab testing. Eventually, you just have to go out and test it in the real world. You would be amazed what we find differs between the real-world environment and one that is predictive of that environment. Flying testbed aircraft allow us to do this more efficiently, both in terms of cost and the ability to test the systems and evolve that testing in real-time with the best minds available present to execute the game plan. They are often a huge component of the success of the system being developed.” Clearly, this is the thinking behind the CRJs in question, which are reconfigurable to support different development efforts. We have seen them with F-35 radomes (see below), targeting pods, dorsal enclosures , ventral gondolas , and even missile seekers sticking out their modular nose cone assemblies. So, these unique airframes are not just about testing radars, but pretty much any tactical sensor system, as well as weapons seekers, including those that are destined for anti-radiation and air-to-air missiles, as well as electronic warfare and even communications systems. With so much military aerospace development currently underway, it is safe to say that we will see much more of these and other testbed aircraft, including new ones , in the future . With the change in digital avionics, you can have multiple relatively discreet airframes flying around testing various state-of-the-art systems that will be critical subcomponents on, say, America’s next stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider , for example, or any other advanced aircraft. Regardless, these CRJs are definitely versatile tools that Northrop Grumman is quite pleased with and proud of.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2021",New Unmanned Loyal Wingman Design Based On Stealthy “Son Of Ares” Jet Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scaled Composites, together with its parent company Northrop Grumman, has unveiled a new unmanned aircraft design, known as the Model 437, which could be configured as a “loyal wingman” intended to work networked together with manned platforms. As such, it could meet the requirements of various efforts seeking to develop, at least in part, this kind of capability, such as the U.S. Air Force’s Skyborg program and the U.K. Royal Air Force’s Project Mosquito . The Model 437 is also notably derived from earlier stealthy Model 401 , also known as the “ Son of Ares ,” which Scaled Composites has now confirmed is intended to be pilot-optional. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and friend of The War Zone , Tweeted out the first details about the Model 437, as well as concept art showing the design, yesterday. He had earlier attended an event at the Air Force’s Plant 42 in California, which centered on the work being done on both the Model 437 and the Model 401. A Scaled Composites Model 401, from which the Model 437 is derived., Scaled Composites “Scaled Composites showed us a concept for the Model 437, an unmanned cousin of the Model 401, which we also got a full debrief on four years after first flight,” Trimble wrote on Twitter. “It’s [the Model 437] a candidate for USAF Skyborg and RAF Mosquito.” Concept art that was provided to Aviation Week , seen at the top of this story and below, underscores the Model 437’s evolution from the earlier Model 401, with the two appearing to share much of the same general planform, at least in broad strokes, including their swept main wings and v-tail. Like the Model 401, the Model 437 also has a top-mounted air intake for its engine, which Aviation Week has reported will be a Williams FJ44-series turbofan . The unmanned aircraft’s design appears to have been stealthy features, just like its older cousin, as well. Northrop Grumman/Scaled Composites via Steve Trimble/Aviation Week However, the Model 437 does also feature a completely new fuselage and its wings appear to be better optimized for faster speed, as well as for greater efficiency at those speeds. The drone looks to lack the notably high camber seen on the Model 401, too. The Model 401 first emerged publicly in 2017 and there are now two of these aircraft. Online flight tracking data had indicated that both of these jets had arrived at Plant 42 ahead of this week’s event, which also included a fly-by by one of these planes, according to Trimble. The two Model 401s, which are nicknamed Deimos and Phobos , are themselves related in some way to Scaled Composites’ earlier Agile Responsive Effective Support (ARES) demonstrator aircraft. Deimos and Phobos are the names of the Greek gods of terror and panic, respectively, and were the sons of Ares, the god of war. As such, the jets are also often referred to as the “Sons of Ares,” as you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s exclusive reporting here . Scaled Composites has now also formally named the Model 401 design the Sierra . It’s worth noting that the full concept art also shows manned and unmanned versions of the Model 401, as well as Northrop Grumman’s SG-101 stealth UCAV . Trimble says he was also shown a mock-up of the pilotless Model 401 during his visit to Plant 42. Northrop Grumman’s SG-101, as well as the smaller SG-102, are unmanned combat air vehicle concepts that are unrelated to the Model 401 and Model 437. The company first unveiled these designs last year as part of its response to the Air Force’s MQ-Next effort , which is exploring successors to the MQ-9 Reaper , as you can read more about here . With regards to the new Model 437 design, it is also expected to have a range of some 3,000 nautical miles when carrying a load of 4,000 pounds of fuel, and will be able to cruise at around 0.8 Mach, according to Aviation Week . The drone has an internal centerline payload bay that is designed to carry up to 1,000 pounds of stores or other systems, as well. The outlet was told said that a pair of AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) or a side-looking radar imaging sensor were two possible loadouts. Aviation Week learned that the primary expected use for the Model 437 is as a semi-autonomous loyal wingman-type drone working alongside manned aircraft, including fighter jets or so-called high-value airborne assets, or HVAAs. The U.S. Air Force includes various types of supporting aircraft, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, as well as aerial refueling tankers , among other types in its definition of HVAA . In short, this is a category of aircraft that are critical to current and future aerial operations, but that includes a large number of non-stealthy types that are increasingly vulnerable to hostile fighters and other air defenses , especially the ever-more-advanced capabilities being fielded by near-peer opponents, such as China and Russia. With this in mind, Scaled Composites has presented the Model 437 to its parent company as a potential candidate for the aforementioned Skyborg program and Project Mosquito, though this unmanned aircraft does not appear to have been formally pitched to either the U.S. Air Force or the Royal Air Force as of yet. Demands for loyal wingman-type drones are emerging elsewhere around the world , as well. Boeing is notably deep in the development of another loyal wingman design, known as the Airpower Teaming System (ATS), for the Royal Australian Air Force. In addition, it is certainly interesting to note that the potential to transform the Model 401 into a drone, including for use as a loyal wingman, has been discussed on many occasions since that design first appeared some four years ago. Whether Scaled Composites and Northrop Grumman now plan to offer both the unmanned version of the Model 401, as well as the Model 437 drone, for general sale is unclear, though the concept art available now certainly suggests this will be the case. The unmanned Model 401 would offer a larger platform with a greater ability to loiter over certain areas in support of ISR and other mission sets. The pilotless Model 401 could certainly provide a testbed to support the development of the Model 437. The War Zone has already been closely tracking the use of the manned Model 401s to support various research and development and test and evaluation activities, some of which have been quite exotic in nature, so an unmanned variant could certainly offer a platform for more general testing duties. The aircraft themselves were originally built to help prove out and refine rapid design and production concepts. It took approximately 24 months for Scaled Composites to go from the very start of the Model 401’s development to a first flight. “The two vehicles are carbon copies of each other. Scaled utilized its in-house agile development processes to concurrently design and build these two demonstrator aircraft, validating Scaled’s digital design and advanced manufacturing methods,” according to Scaled Composites’ website . “By rapidly building two of the same vehicle, Scaled was able to implement design and build solutions discovered on the first aircraft immediately into the second.” The two Scaled Composites Model 401s flying together., Scaled Composites Scaled Composites is well known, in general, for adapting and repurposing many of its designs to meet shifting or all-new requirements. The War Zone has already reached out to Northrop Grumman for additional information about the Model 437, as well as its progenitor, the Model 401, and we are very excited to learn more about what the future holds for the “Son of Ares,” as well as its own new offspring.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",North Korea Trades Missiles For Militias At Its Latest Parade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a distinct change from North Korea’s familiar practice of unveiling new ballistic missiles and other high-profile equipment during large-scale military parades, the country’s capital early this morning hosted lines of marchers, including some in orange hazmat suits, as well as displays of troops with dogs and on horseback, while tractors towed rocket launchers and anti-armor weapons. The latter category included what has been identified as a previously unseen version of the Bulsae-3 anti-tank guided missile, perhaps the standout item in what was, altogether, a truly unusual spectacle, even by North Korean standards. The parade, which was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un, looking notably slimmer than in the past, was held in Pyongyang’s Kim Il-sung Square to celebrate the 73rd anniversary of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). It was the first parade of its kind on such a scale since President Joe Biden took office in the United States and, all told, represented a significant change in style from similar events in recent years . Ranks of militia and personnel in hazmat suits during the September 9 parade in the North Korean capital., North Korean State Media While the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that fighter jets flew in formation over the parade, the actual items visible on the ground were altogether more prosaic, including horse patrols, canine units, and even fire trucks. Not only were the famous ballistic missiles absent, but there was apparently no heavy military equipment of any kind, such as tanks , tracked self-propelled artillery, or mechanized air defense weapons , on display this time around. Perhaps the most potent firepower was the multiple rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, and man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) towed by agricultural tractors, also undoubtedly among the more unusual items on display. While we have, in the past, seen rocket launchers paraded on tractor-towed trailers, the appearance of the apparent Bulsae-3 anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) on a tripod launcher, which was in turn mounted on a trailer, was apparently new. The latest in the Bulsae (Phoenix) series of anti-tank missiles, the Bulsae-3 is widely considered to be a clone of the Russian 9M133 Kornet, which has already appeared in the hands of non-state actors , and the North Korean weapon similarly features laser guidance. When it was shown to Kim Jong-un in early 2016, the North Korean leader boasted that the Bulsae-3 could turn even the best-protected enemy main battle tanks into “boiled pumpkin.” A flat-bed trailer carrying the apparent tripod-mounted Bulsae-3 ATGM, as well as a MANPADS operator., KCNA Screencap Tractors tow multiple rocket launchers through Pyongyang’s Kim Il-sung Square to celebrate the 73rd anniversary of the DPRK. , North Korean State Media Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans, independent experts on the North Korean military, who have written extensively on the subject, told The War Zone that combining the Bulsae-3 with the repurposed agricultural tractors was likely done expressly for the parade. As such it’s unlikely that the North Korean military would actually plan to bring anti-tank weapons onto the battlefield in this way, although the country’s armed forces certainly do make use of tractors and civilian trucks as prime movers for rocket launchers and other equipment, especially to boost the firepower of its extensive reserve forces. Whatever the practicality, the weapons themselves — and their operators — represent an important part of North Korea’s defenses that are often overlooked in favor of new intercontinental ballistic missile designs, for example, and hardware from other high-profile, advanced military programs. The previous major parade, in January, had grabbed attention by including the first appearance of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). Today’s parade instead highlighted the contribution of the Worker-Peasant Red Guard to the country’s armed forces, explaining the more paramilitary feel of the whole event. The Worker-Peasant Red Guard was established as a reserve formation during the Korean War that was waged from 1950 to 1953 and today numbers around 5.7 million, according to the Korean Central News Agency. The last time we have seen the Worker-Peasant Red Guard take part in a parade of this kind was back in 2013. While the Guard does have plenty of other weapons at its disposal, its soldiers are typically equipped with weapons passed down from frontline units and only a limited number of advanced equipment is available to them. In fact, some of the Guard’s equipment dates back to the era of its establishment, including Korean War-era T-34 tanks and SU-100 self-propelled artillery. Infantry weapons can be of an even older vintage, among them Mosin-Nagant rifles and PPSh-41 sub-machine guns dating back to World War II. With that in mind, the apparent issuing of new Bulsae-3 ATGMs to the Guard is especially significant. “The Worker-Peasant Red Guard makes up much of the DPRK population and is as such organized by region and even through specific occupations,” Mitzer and Oliemans explain. “It is also responsible for manning many of the DPRK’s ubiquitous AAA [anti-aircraft artillery] sites, manned by locals and workers.” In fact, while the prodigious size of the Worker-Peasant Red Guard singles it out, it’s just one of several militia organizations in the country, which also include the 600,000-strong Reserve Military Training Unit, which is made up of former conscripts and can be mobilized more rapidly than the Guard in case of conflict, as well as the Red Youth Guard, which comprises child soldiers aged between 14 and 16. “The parade seems to be strictly designed as a domestic festival aimed at promoting national unity and solidarity of the regime,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told the Guardian newspaper, reflecting on the different mood of the event. Rather than nuclear-delivery systems, the emphasis was on paramilitary units as well as public security forces, while the ranks of marchers in hazmat suits, complete with respirators and hoods, and described as “emergency anti-epidemic” fighters by state media, were intended to show the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For some time now, Pyongyang, for its part, has made outlandish claims that it has had zero COVID cases, despite much evidence to the contrary. “Emergency anti-epidemic” fighters strike an especially dystopian note at the Pyongyang parade., North Korean State Media The focus on paramilitary and public security forces also provides a means for the North Korean leadership to demonstrate its ability to crack down on any potential internal dissent at a time in which the country’s economy is under extreme pressure. The strict lockdown enforced to tackle the pandemic has combined with ongoing sanctions and severe flooding, leading to official warnings of food shortages. As well as the notable absence of nuclear delivery systems, today’s parade also did not feature a speech by Kim Jong-un, who in the past has used such opportunities to talk up North Korea’s military capabilities. Despite the sanctions, North Korea has been steadily building up its missile forces as well as its stockpile of fissile material required for nuclear warheads. Only recently, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that North Korea appeared to have restarted its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, which is believed to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. At the same time, it may be that Pyongyang has decided to take a less bellicose stance amid the continued diplomatic stalemate with the United States, although it has so far rejected American offers to resume discussions on the nuclear issue. Were talks to begin again, it is expected that Washington would offer to ease some of the sanctions in exchange for the DPRK making concessions on its nuclear weapons program. There is also the possibility that the landmark of the 73rd anniversary of the DPRK’s founding was not deemed significant enough for a parade featuring new or existing strategic weapons systems. With the ruling Workers’ Party celebrating its anniversary in early October, this could provide another opportunity to show off other, and potentially new, military hardware. The corresponding event in October last year saw North Korea unveil a huge new road-mobile ICBM, which you can read more about here . It might not be too long, therefore, until North Korea stages another military parade that again showcases its military might and its growing nuclear capability. In the meantime, today’s smaller parade throws light on the lesser-known, but still important reserve forces available to Pyongyang, as well as revealing a renewed focus on internal security and the country’s response to COVID-19 and other domestic challenges.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 27, 2021",New Navy Task Force Will Be All About Bringing Unmanned Capabilities To The Middle East,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s top command in the Middle East is set to stand up a new task force specifically to manage the use of the service’s unmanned platforms across the region. This will include drones in the air, as well as unmanned surface vessels and unmanned underwater vehicles, or USVs and UUVs. The Navy hopes to use this force to improve its overall regional situational awareness, especially with regards to the activities of Iran and its proxies , among other missions, as well as just provide an operationally representative space to explore various new concepts of operations . The Associated Press was among the first to report on the planned establishment of this new unmanned force earlier today. Navy Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, head of both 5th Fleet and Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), which are often referred to collectively as 5th Fleet/NAVCENT, offered some additional details about the unit, which is expected to be called Task Force 59. The Navy’s Sea Hunter and Seahawk medium-displacement unmanned surface vessels, or USVs, sail together during the Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21 (UxS IBP 21) experiment in 2021. The Associated Press reported that 5th Fleet/NAVCENT’s future Task Force 59 could oversee operations involving various unmanned platforms that had been demonstrated during UxS IBP 21.  , USN The Navy’s numbered fleets are typically broken into different standing task forces responsible for overseeing the employment of different types of capabilities. At present, 5th Fleet/NAVCENT, which has its headquarters in Bahrain in the Persian Gulf, has nine such task forces . These include Task Force 50 and 51, which are responsible for managing the activities of carrier and expeditionary strike groups deployed to the region. Task Forces 52, 53, 54, and 55 handle mine warfare , logistics, submarine warfare , and surface warfare operations , respectively. Task Force 56, or the fleet’s Expeditionary Combat Forces, oversees a variety of specialized capabilities, including explosive ordnance disposal and mobile construction units . Task Force 57 is the maritime patrol aircraft element within 5th Fleet/NAVCENT. Lastly, there is Task Force Shore Battlespace, which “coordinates all facility and security support for shore installations in the AOR [area of responsibility],” according to the fleet’s website. 5th Fleet/NAVCENT had previously used Task Force 59 as a designation for temporary contingents assembled in response to regional contingencies. For instance, in 2006, an earlier Task Force 59 had been activated to help with the evacuation of Americans from Lebanon after a major conflict broke out that year between the militant group Hezbollah and Israel. Now, the new Task Force 59 will shift its attention to unmanned operations. “We want to put more systems out in the maritime domain above, on and below the sea,” Vice Admiral Cooper said, according to The Associated Press . “We want more eyes on what’s happening out there.” The Associated Press reported that the Navy did not specify what unmanned systems would fall under the task force’s auspices. However, the outlet also said that it was its understanding that the full array of platforms would include some of those that the service had demonstrated during a huge unmanned-focused exercise, dubbed Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21 , or UxS IBP 21, that was held off the coast of California earlier this year. A wide variety of drones, USVs, and UUVs took part in UxS IBP 21, including types in service with the Navy now, as well as experimental platforms. In the air, there were examples of the Navy’s operational MQ-8B Fire Scout drone helicopters, as well as an MQ-9B Sea Guardian , a maritime-focused variant of General Atomics’ MQ-9 Reaper , and Vanilla Unmanned ‘s Ultra-Long Flight Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle. Down below were the Navy’s two multi-purpose medium-displacement USVs, Sea Hunter and Seahawk . The smaller ADARO USV and various torpedo-shaped USVs that the service has in inventory now , as well as an unmanned vehicle from Ocean Aero that was capable of sailing on top of the waves and diving below them, also took part in the event, among other platforms. High-altitude balloons and swarming technology , among other things , were also demonstrated during the experiment. You can read more about what we know about UxS IBP 21, overall, here , though much of what happened during the event remains classified. Any combination of these platforms, or other similar unmanned systems, would be a valuable addition to 5th Fleet/NAVCENT’s arsenal. They could be especially useful for monitoring activities in, around, and above various waterways in the Middle East, including the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz that links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Bab Al Mandeb Strait that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. Iran and its regional proxies have been blamed for a variety of malign actions , including attacks on commercial ships , and civilian targets along various coastlines , in or near these waterways, as well as elsewhere in the Middle East , in the past few years. Unmanned platforms, including so-called “ suicide drones ” or “kamikaze drones,” as well as explosive-laden drone boats , have actually been used to carry out many of these attacks. A slide from a US Navy briefing on the Iranian attack on Liberian-flagged, Israeli-operated tanker M/T Mercer Street off the coast of Oman in July 2021, which provides an overview of a family of Iranian delta wing “kamikaze” drones that have been used in multiple attacks in recent years. These are just some examples of the kinds of threats currently present in 5th Fleet/NAVCENT’s area of responsibility., USN Unmanned platforms would offer new ways, as well as just additional capacity, to patrol across the region for these kinds of threats, among others , on a more persistent basis, and do so in the face of factors that might limit the endurance or overall utility of certain manned aircraft and vessels. “The 5th Fleet includes shallow water areas, salty waters and temperatures in the summertime that can go above 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity,” The Associated Press story noted, conditions that can be rough on crews and equipment alike. “I think that environment really suits us well to experiment and move faster,” Vice Admiral Cooper said. “And our belief is if the new systems can work here, they can probably work anywhere else and can scale them across other fleets.” Increase the use of unmanned systems could also help free up manned vessels, especially larger surface warships and submarines, as well as aircraft, for higher priority missions. The employment of unmanned platforms also reduces the risks to actual Navy personnel , which could, in turn, help prevent crises from escalating . At the same time, hostile actors, such as Iran, could be more inclined to harass, or even damage or destroy, unmanned platforms, due to this reduced potential for escalation. The video below shows the Navy’s Cyclone class patrol craft USS Firebolt firing warning shots at boats belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revoutionary Guard Corps during an altercation in the Persian Gulf in April 2021. Beyond all this, as Vice Admiral Cooper noted, the Middle East also just offers a good region for the Navy to begin putting various unmanned operations concepts to the test. Overall, 5th Fleet/NAVCENT’s area of responsibility offers a multi-faceted testing ground where the service can push unmanned technologies forward to more quickly understand and integrate them into day-to-day activities in an operationally relevant environment. This wouldn’t be the first time the Navy has utilized 5th Fleet/NAVCENT in this way, either. For years, the Navy has operated a fleet of RQ-4A Global Hawk drones, referred to as Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrators (BAMS-D), in the region. Experience with those unmanned aircraft helped inform the service’s concepts of operations for its new MQ-4C Triton drones, which are Global Hawk derivatives configured specifically for maritime operations . Iran notably shot down one of the BAMS-D drones down in 2019, also underscoring the potential dangers unmanned platforms might face in the region. Lessons learned from Task Force 59’s activities could very well be applicable to other numbered fleets, such as 3rd and 7th Fleets in the Pacific region. One would imagine that other fleets are also now looking into standing up unmanned-centric task forces. At the same time, it is interesting that 5th Fleet/NAVCENT has chosen to put all of its unmanned capabilities together rather than integrating specific types with their manned counterparts under the oversight of its existing task forces. The UxS IBP 21 experiment notably focused heavily on manned-unmanned teaming concepts, among others. The EOD elements within Task Force 56 should also already have various UUVs and it’s not clear whether the creation of Task Force 59 will have an impact on how those platforms are employed. The creation of the new unit will certainly present an opportunity to see if this kind of command and control structure is the most effective. All told, 5th Fleet/NAVCENT now looks set to become an incubator of sorts for the Navy to begin moving a variety of unmanned concepts of operation out of the realm of experimentation and into actual day-to-day operations in the Middle East and beyond.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The MD-80 series of airliners, often referred to lovingly by their nickname “Mad Dog,” are disappearing from our skies at an alarming rate. No major carrier in the U.S. flies them today, with American retiring the type in 2019 . Surplus MD-80s are now scattered around the globe in small groups, some still carrying humans and others hauling cargo, but it’s safe to say that the type is deep into the twilight of its career. One famous airline that is based in Alaska, Everts Air Cargo , known for its eclectic fleet, which includes antique piston-engined airliner types, and that flies into some very tight and rough wilderness locales, operates the MD-80s in cargo-carrying configurations. In fact, they were the first to receive a cargo-converted Mad Dog. One of these aircraft, N963CE, popped up very far from its home recently and put on one hell of a show when it went on its merry way. The video comes to us from the appropriately named YouTuber CameronMD80 . The video was shot at Nassau International Airport in the Bahamas last week. It was there that the seemingly out-of-place aircraft was found and filmed. Here is the aviation videographer’s description of his rare catch: I would have never expected this visit and I definitely would have never expected their takeoffs to go down the way they did. It’s been a while since I’ve seen an MD80 locally. The last time I got to enjoy them was in November 2019 when Delta sent theirs for the last time. A private MD came a few months later but that doesn’t really count in my eyes as it happened at night while I was home; although that is the last time that I can recall that an MD came to Nassau. Fast forward to these past few days. We got two unexpected visits from an “airline” that seems quite far from home with a crew that was very antsy to show off what an empty Maddog can do. If this is the last time I see an MD80 locally, I definitely can’t complain. While catching this rare Alsaksan Mad Dog in the Bahamas would be awesome enough for most plane spotters, it’s what the crew did when they took off that really made the encounter very special. Instead of executing a normal climb, this Mad Dog crew went for something more akin to an F-15 max performance “Viking climb” or at the very least, a “tactical departure,” as used by U.S. military airlifters operating in very hostile territory. The MD-80 is seen rotating quickly, then keeping its nose down and sucking the gear up, and barreling down the runway before entering into a steep zoom climb at the end of the runway. It is an awesome sight to behold for those of us that miss seeing—and hearing—the Mad Dog in action. The aircraft has been making runs between Opa Locka Executive in Florida and Nassau, including on September 2nd, 3rd, and 8th, according to online flight tracking data. Why it is supporting this route remains unclear, but it is a very short hop, just over half an hour. So if the jet is empty it would need very little fuel to get back to its temporary base in Florida. As such, you have the unique circumstances to push the Mad Dog to its very max, as we see in the video above.

"Corporal ‘Matty’ Matthews, Thomas Newdick","Updated on Sep 15, 2021",What It’s Like Being A Royal Air Force Photographer Capturing The Action On Deployment,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Military aviation and photography are inextricably linked, evidenced by the multitude of enthusiasts who love nothing more than to seek out the best opportunities to capture aircraft in the air or on the ground, often going considerable distances , metaphorically and physically, to ensure they’re in the right place at the right time to get that once-in-a-lifetime shot . As well as all those civilians who love nothing more than photographing these military machines at work, there is a much smaller cadre of air force professionals for whom this is their daily job. Working as an air force photographer brings the same kinds of demands of any uniformed career, but it’s perhaps the best way to ensure hands-on access to these aircraft, and it’s a job that can take you around the world, to wherever, in fact, air forces go about their daily operations. Corporal ‘Matty’ Matthews, in his ‘office’ aboard a C-130J Hercules., Crown Copyright Among the air force photographers out there capturing some truly memorable imagery is Corporal ‘Matty’ Matthews. What follows is his account of the challenges — and the big rewards — of a fascinating career with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as how he captured some of his most eye-catching images: I sometimes find it difficult to talk about what I do, and not see it as being a normal ‘nine-to-five’ job. After all, it has been 14 years since I took my first step into the world, and the lifestyle, that is photography in the Royal Air Force. It’s only when I stop and look back through what I have managed to capture, what I have experienced, only then do I start to realize that actually what we do as Royal Air Force Photographers is simply unexampled. During my 14 years with the RAF, I have been stationed at Cosford, Aldergrove, Henlow, High Wycombe, and Halton. Currently, I’m at Brize Norton , Oxfordshire, as a photographer within the trials unit that is the Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit , or JADTEU. It’s funny, when you say ‘JADTEU’ it doesn’t sound overly exciting, and yet of all my postings, it has been the most unique, fascinating, and diverse of the roles I’ve encountered. Loading an Army Air Corps Bell 212 helicopter onboard a Royal Air Force C-17, a job planned and executed by engineers and logisticians at the Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit based at RAF Brize Norton., Crown Copyright I am one of five ‘trials’ photographers and we are there directly supporting the Air & Space Warfare Centre, a research and test organization. This entails capturing rappelling, fast-roping , rope troop extraction system and ladder troop extraction system (RTES and LTES), test parachuting, as well as trialing loads on every aircraft type in service, be it fixed-wing or rotary. We fly flight trials, para trials, and dispatch trials here in the UK and further afield in the likes of Temecula in California, Seville in Spain, and Yuma in Arizona. To add, who we work with is just as diverse. No surprise, then, that all three U.K. armed services work within JADTEU, and further still a myriad of branches lend their trade knowledge in what is arguably the most forward-thinking unit within the U.K. Ministry of Defense. It can be a very challenging role, with lots of hanging out of aircraft doors and ramps. Crawling under vehicles photographing chain patterns. Long ‘tabs’ [British Army slang for a loaded march] in the pouring rain accessing trials sites. Then again, I wouldn’t change what we do, and the team of photographers around me are some of the best in my branch, so everything just works. But the point of this is to talk about the other aspect of being an RAF Photographer — deploying. We currently have two permanently deployed photogs, one in the British Forces South Atlantic Islands, also known as the Falklands . The other (that was me) is based out of RAF Akrotiri on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, covering defense operations across the entire Middle East. The Akrotiri posting is about as diverse a role as they come, and this was my second time behind the proverbial wheel. You travel a lot, you fly a lot, you capture, a lot. Whether it’s our Typhoons , in their fully-loaded-out ‘fits,’ providing essential overwatch for the Coalition over Iraqi and Syrian airspace, or the C-130Js flying missions moving freight and personnel throughout the Middle East from Erbil in Iraq through to Kuwait. Then there are the A400Ms that are beginning to take the lion’s share of the deployed workload from the Hercules, and not forgetting the Voyager tankers providing that tactically required fuel for the aforementioned Typhoons. As with the rest of the world, COVID has been the biggest change and consideration this time around in Akrotiri. However, it was simply another aspect of the role that was managed, ensuring that we abided by the government directives while capturing defense as it supported operations. Despite the challenges that were faced by me and my Media Officer we still walked away with some unique and, at times, historic imagery while deployed for four months in Cyprus. So, here’s a look at some of my favorites, how I took them, why I took them, and some of the challenges we faced in the planning and during capture. Night-time top-up Crown Copyright This night-time shot was captured during one of my earliest tasks. I never had, but always wanted to, capture the Typhoons and Voyagers during a night sortie while flying over Iraq. It was far from easy. The Typhoon pilots refueled with night-vision goggles meaning the Voyager’s wing lights couldn’t be utilized. Furthermore, despite almost every evening being generally pretty clear below, on this sortie there was a huge amount of cloud cover over our operating area. Then, as if to cement the already present issues, the moon was nowhere to be seen, so ambient light was as close to zero as you could ever imagine it to be. Despite the challenges, I did all I could to capture the Typhoons. The reds and greens of their wing beacons scream through my imagery, seemingly reverberating off of the heightened ISO [the camera setting for the sensitivity of the sensor, similar to the speed of film]. Amazingly, using a tripod helped ever so slightly — there were fleeting moments when the Typhoons, through some skilled flying, somehow matched the flow of the Voyager, allowing for a couple of usable shots to creep through my memory cards. Voyager in hyperspace I wasn’t overly happy with what I had captured during the Typhoon refueling, but not one to rest on any laurels, I strapped in for our descent into Akrotiri. My 5D and 16-35mm was ready to go, secured to a tripod which was secured to me. I wanted to get a nice shot of the landing, a long exposure, sacrificing as little of my ISO as I could manage while ensuring that the image wasn’t littered with enough movement to make it unusable. Throughout the flight, you’re on the aircraft’s comms, so I was talking to the Voyager pilots and jokingly mentioned my idea for a shot, elaborating that this needed to be the smoothest landing they had ever performed. As expected they did not disappoint. As the aircraft effortlessly came into land it gave me the opportunity to capture the above shot from the flight deck, and a good few more frames with the cockpit sharp and the outside exhibiting that awe-inspiring, hyperspace-esque blur ahead of us. Crown Copyright Typhoon takeoff If this next shot had another name, it would be ‘labor of love.’ Last time I deployed I wanted to get this shot and never managed it, through a mixture of Tornado GR4s (oh, how I miss them) aborting their take-offs, bad timing, or just general bad luck. Crown Copyright I went straight into trying to grab the shot again. I sat out on the runway on what must have been four or five different sorties. Waves of mosquitos rose up around me as the sun and temperature dropped. Each time the aircraft lifted the sun was too high, the jets went too early, or too late. One sortie I took a risk standing on the other side of the runway — yeah, that didn’t work. Then came sortie number five… or six… I can’t remember. I once again placed myself back out on the runway. Approximately at the halfway point, just before the jets hit rotate. I watched the sun setting slowly ahead of me and heard their roar as they lined up on runway 28’s threshold. At this point, the sun seemed too high, so I expected nothing. Two of the four EJ200 engines wound up and I saw aircraft 345 begin to roll. She hit her rotate point, the nose lifted, wheels up and just as she got parallel to me I realized that she was flying straight for the sun. I couldn’t believe it: no two take-offs are the same, so I was ecstatic to see this one fly the path that it did. Noting the change in exposure I went from f5 [aperture] through to f32 in a couple of seconds and watched as the pilot effortlessly took the delta wing straight into, and through the sun. A bird’s eye view at Akrotiri This image started out as an inspirational idea courtesy of @onemoreweektogo over on Instagram. A good deal of his imagery includes shots of airliners at the likes of LAX, taken from a helo tracking the jets around the airfield. With that in mind, I drew up the idea to capture a Shader wave while flying in a Griffin HAR2 search-and-rescue helicopter of 84 Squadron. Crown Copyright The sortie started life as a crudely drawn-up flight path on Google Maps. One route for the 28 runway, another for runway 10, depending on the way the wind blew. Invariably the wind runs east to west after midday, so I hedged my bets on 28. As ever until about 30 minutes before lift-off, the wind stubbornly kept us on 10, thankfully as we walked it swung enough and I knew I’d be tracking the Voyager up the taxiway. Once airborne the Griffin flew at 500 feet, performing a snaking motion while matching the taxi speed of the Voyager throughout the entire 9,000 feet of asphalt. As we came up to the 28 hold, the Griffin then performed a fluid horizontal loop with us crossing the runway as a Typhoon pairing lined up on the threshold. Once lined up we transited north of the runway, lining up two-thirds down the runway going static just as the Typhoons began to roll. The pair lifted and as always banked left into their circuit well away from us. Knowing the Voyager utilizes much more runway to lift we crept a further 500 feet down and captured her lift and again left-break away from us. Chasing the Herc Crown Copyright A nice surprise was this C-130J, which we noticed lining up earlier than expected, allowing even more media-collect of another iconic and important aircraft that operates in support of defense out there. It must be noted, none of this would have been possible had it not been for the ninja flying of the 84 Squadron crew at the controls of the Griffin. As with everything aviation-related we had a pre-planned path that had to be dynamically changed while flying. Paratroopers over Jordan Then there was the week the carrier came to town. Operation Fortis, as the Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) deployment is named, was a huge moment out there, and the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was of course on the forefront of everyone’s minds. That being said, we also wanted to ensure that the RAF was well represented within the media output for this phase of CSG21. This resulted in me being embedded within the Hercules Detachment. The first sortie I was rostered to fly on, arguably the most important, involved three Hercs flying over to Jordan, two carrying 80 paras apiece, the third frame with containers (using the CDS, or container delivery system method) to be dispatched by members of 47 Air Dispatch Squadron. Crown Copyright Considering the magnitude of what was about to happen it was no surprise to hear that the civilian press was on board the two para Hercs to document the drops. With that in mind, I had been manifested to also fly on one of those frames. Thankfully having worked at JADTEU for the previous year I had a much greater understanding of how para and CDS drops were conducted. The paradoors were always going to be the method of exit. This meant the split ramp wouldn’t be lowered and I couldn’t get on the harness. CDS, on the other hand, will always have the ramp lowered and I knew I could follow it down the aircraft while on the harness. I took the risk and jumped on with the CDS knowing I may get nothing of the paras. I spoke with the crew and asked if it were possible to run in when the paras dropped; as ever, no promises, the task was always the priority. We lifted and transited to Jordan, lined up for our drop watching for the despatcher’s signal, and before we knew it the back of the aircraft was empty. After a bit of ramp-riding capturing some B-roll of Jordan, I got a tap on the shoulder from my Air Loadmaster, and he pointed out to our right. Off in the distance, I saw the other two Hercs lining up for their second stick. I couldn’t believe it, this was ideal, I had my 100-400mm lens on and despite the distance knew I could still record the event from this awesome angle. The first paras started littering the skies and the rest is recorded history now. Hercules, ninja-style This came about after being part of a sortie that involved unloading troops, vehicles, and equipment on the ground in Jordan. A pair of C-130J Hercules headed back to RAF Akrotiri to conduct a circuit, running along the runway before breaking left and coming into land. Crown Copyright The capture involved being on the harness with the split ramp open 1,000 feet higher than the second Herc flying in at 180 knots, below the max speed allowed with the cargo door open. As we flew over the water, the lowest aircraft started 6,000 feet away laterally, judging when to accelerate to 230 knots, catching up with my C-130J pushing the nose up as we hit the minimum allowed 2,000-foot lateral separation. Once we reached this predetermined point in the runway, the lowest Herc raised its nose before conducting a left break into the circuit. This was a huge challenge photographically for a few reasons. The biggest being the time on target; I had one frame to capture the lower Herc where it was at the point where she lined up to make it appear to be flying vertical. I also had to battle with staying rigid on the harness while shooting at a lower-than-normal shutter speed to ensure I captured the iconic ‘prop-blur’ seen with imagery of turboprop-driven aircraft. As ever, a well-planned brief made all the difference, not to mention some ninja flying by the Herc crews. Impressions of Shader My four months out in Akrotiri have borne a lot of imagery I will never forget. This has included capturing loaded F-35Bs breaking away from our Voyager after tanking on one sortie, with Typhoons doing the same on another. I’ve captured the now-retired E-3D Sentry at night, sitting with her for four hours capturing the star trails above. I’ve flown down-route documenting RAF Movers in Iraq, moving personnel, freight and vehicles in high-threat environments. I’ve flown in one of the final ever E-3D operational sorties, filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth from a Herc, and managed to produce videos highlighting the amazing work of the Typhoon, Voyager, and C-130J. Though none of these shots were possible without the skilled personnel I work with throughout the Ministry of Defence, Royal Air Force, and all of the squadrons flying daily missions supporting operations. And now to a few more highlights… Crown Copyright Crown Copyright The E-3D flew its final operational sorties out of RAF Akrotiri both in support of NATO Assurance Measures , as well as over Iraq as part of the global Coalition’s mission to degrade and defeat Daesh. I captured the final ever operational lift-off from the air. Flying with 84 Squadron, Akrotiri’s resident search and rescue squadron, the pilot placed the Griffin HAR2 exactly where it needed to be to catch the Sentry as it hit its rotate point. This was followed by a trip onto the Alpha dispersal at 3:00 am. With the aircraft’s mission done, the only thing left was a final taxi and park-up. Not wanting this moment to be missed, the Akrotiri fire section created a water arch to mark this truly historic moment. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright These next shots were all about highlighting the Typhoon’s armed overwatch mission over Iraq and Syria. When you speak about our Typhoons and Daesh you picture the strikes, yet a huge part of their skillset involves the aircraft and crews flying non-traditional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (NTISR) missions in support of RAF and allied-nation interests. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright While the HMS Queen Elizabeth was in the Med, the F-35Bs of the RAF and U.S. Marine Corps supported Operation Shader, the United Kingdom’s contribution to the ongoing military campaign against ISIS in the Middle East. The F-35Bs were flying the Typhoon’s missions as they launched on the first-ever operational sorties from the carrier, transiting into Iraq and Syria, supported by the Voyagers from Akrotiri, which allowed the jets to remain on station for the duration of their sortie. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright While airborne in the Voyager there’s always a chance that allied nations will come alongside for fuel. I was quite lucky to witness this happen twice. First from a pair of French Navy Rafale Ms and a few weeks later a pair of Italian Air Force F-2000 Typhoons operating in support of that country’s Prima Parthica mission over the Middle East. French Navy Rafale M., Crown Copyright Italian Air Force F-2000 Typhoon., Crown Copyright A number of my nights had me up with the C-130J Hercules Detachment. I captured several aspects including the Ground Engineers, Movers, Force Protection, and, as seen here, the flight crews. Crown Copyright Herc missions are invariably conducted during the twilight hours. This always makes photography a challenge, especially when the cockpit lights are switched off, or dimmed. However, when I did manage to capture something worthwhile, the resulting images always came out pretty special. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright For now, it’s time to sign off as my replacement takes a hold of the role at Akrotiri, and, as all RAF photographers do, creates their own unique documentation of this detachment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 2, 2021",Previously Unreleased Photo Shows Secret Service Armored Limos Damaged On 9/11,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just days before the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the U.S. Secret Service has released what it says are never-before-seen pictures of severely damaged, if not totally destroyed armored limousines and other vehicles at a garage belonging to its field office in New York City. At that time, the field office itself had been inside 7 World Trade Center, which ultimately collapsed as a result of the infamous attacks. The U.S. Secret Service’s official Twitter account posted two photographs today from inside the garage in the aftermath of the attacks. Exactly where this garage was located and when these pictures were taken is unclear. One picture, seen below, looks to show a number of sedans that Secret Service personnel could have used for a variety of day-to-day activities. It’s also not clear if this garage contained any personal vehicles at the time of the attacks. Sedans in a garage belonging to the US Secret Service’s New York City Field Office in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks., US Secret Service “These never-before-seen photos show some of the armored limousines parked at the former #SecretService New York Field Office that were damaged during the #September11 attack. #NeverForget,” the accompanying Tweet reads. The other photograph, seen at the top of this story and below, shows a pair of limousines. One of them appears to be based on a 1993 or later model of the Cadillac Fleetwood. Our colleagues at The Drive say that the other looks to be based on the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, production of which ended in 1992. Modified Fleetwoods were the primary presidential limousine during President Bill Clinton’s two terms in office. These limos are understood to have had a substantial number of improvements and modifications , including armor and other protective features, as well as a robust communications suite. The severely damaged, if not destroyed armored limousines. The vehicle on the left looks to be a 1990s-era Cadillac Fleetwood limo, while the one on the right appears to be based on the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham., US Secret Service A modified Cadillac Fleetwood presidential limousine that is now on display at the Clinton Presidential Library and Museum., Cliff via Wikimedia An all-new purpose-built, heavily-armored presidential limo design, the first generation of what is now commonly referred to as the Beast , had made its public debut at President George W. Bush’s inauguration in January 2001. Unlike the Fleetwoods, this vehicle actually used an SUV chassis to help handle the weight and associated stresses of all the modifications and additions. Subsequent generations of Beasts, which you can read more about in detail here , reportedly use even more robust truck chassis. This shift to dedicated vehicle design had been driven in no small part by the fact that everything the Secret Service had added to the older Cadillacs made them a maintenance nightmare, prone to broken transmissions and other issues. “The brakes would last about two trips,” a veteran agent told Autoweek back in 2013. “The cars were just too heavy, and they were a terror to drive , and even harder to stop.” However, it’s not necessarily surprising that the Secret Service’s garage in New York City still had some older limos on hand eight months later. The Secret Service provides protection to various senior U.S. government officials beyond the President of the United States, as well as visiting foreign dignitaries. New York City is a major domestic and international economic and cultural hub, and is also home to the United Nations’ headquarters building. In 2001, it was certainly a place where there would be a significant standing need for Secret Service support, and it remains so today. In addition, the total number of Beasts has always been relatively small . Having other limos, even older ones, in place in New York City would have eliminated the need to necessarily airlift in the latest models for presidential visits, or just provided additional backups, if necessary. Of course, it’s also possible that the Cadillacs seen in the picture from the field office garage may not have been in a presidential configuration, to begin with. Regardless, nearly 20 years after 9/11, an image of Secret Service Fleetwoods feels, perhaps more than ever, like a small window into America as it existed before those terrorist attacks, which also had an irrevocable impact on the rest of the world. It’s also a reminder of all that was lost on that day, far beyond any cars in a garage. A total of 2,977 people were killed in New York City and in Washington, D.C., including first responders who raced to the Twin Towers after the planes hit. Many of those who helped with the rescue and subsequent cleanup efforts, as well as other bystanders, have been left with debilitating and sometimes fatal health complications . One Secret Service agent, Craig Miller, died in the attacks. Miller, who was also a U.S. Army veteran, is believed to have died after rushing to the scene to try to help. Underscoring the long-lasting impacts of 9/11, his remains were not identified until 2014. “It was very hard because [Miller] is one of us and could have been any one of us, even though I didn’t know him personally,” Damian Schwartz, another Secret Service agent, told ABC News in an interview in 2018 after having returned to work at the New York City field office, which is now inside the new 7 World Trade Center building that opened in 2006. “I saw a lot of very horrific things take place on that morning, and then to come back this many years later … it’s very serene and it’s very calming.” We here at The War Zone are glad the Secret Service has decided to share these interesting pictures and are grateful for the actions of its personnel, among many, many others, on that fateful day almost two decades ago.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 10, 2021",Here’s How Fighter Pilots Could Control “Loyal Wingmen” Via A Tablet On Their Thigh,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, or GA-ASI , recently announced that it had conducted a demonstration to show how pilots in fourth and fifth-generation fighter jets will work together with advanced semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type unmanned aircraft in the future. During the test, an individual riding in a specially-configured Beechcraft King Air twin-engine turboprop, acting as a surrogate for a fighter jet, was able to issue commands to a stealthy Avenger drone through a software app loaded onto a tablet-like device. GA-ASI announced the successful completion of the demonstration in a press release on Sept. 3, 2021. The actual test had taken place in the skies over southern California on Aug. 25. The Avenger flew from the company’s Desert Horizon facility in the Mojave Desert, while the modified King Air operated from San Diego’s Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. A General Atomics Avenger drone., GA-ASI “The demo lasted for approximately two hours,” according to the press release. “The successful test proves the ability for GA-ASI MUM-T [manned-unmanned teaming] to command airborne assets while autonomously executing behaviors and missions that provide increased awareness and effectiveness to the warfighter.” “This flight builds on the previous long-wave IR passive autonomous testing, and continues to validate that persistent Group 5 UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] aircraft can perform complex Air Moving Target Indication (AMTI),” Mike Atwood, GA-ASI’s Senior Director of Advanced Concepts, said in a statement. Group 5 refers to the highest tier in the U.S. military’s drone categorization system , which includes any unmanned aircraft with a weight of more than 1,320 pounds and that have a “normal operating altitude” of at least 18,000 feet. Atwood appears to have been referring to multiple tests that GA-ASI has conducted in the past year or so involving Avengers conducting mock aerial search missions, including flights involving drones equipped with Lockheed Martin’s Legion Pod with the IRST21 infrared search and track (IRST) sensor, with varying degrees of autonomy. In July, an Avenger carrying a Legion Pod demonstrated its ability to autonomously spot and track targets, as well as pursue them. A General Atomics Avenger with a Lockheed Martin Legion Pod containing an IRST system under its right wing., GA-ASI IRST systems, which you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone feature , offer a way for fighter jets to detect and track hostile aircraft and other threats without actively using their radars. This, in turn, means friendly aircraft don’t have to give their presence, or even potential location, away by sending out radar waves. An enemy pilot may not even know they have been detected, either. IRST sensors also work irrespective of any radar-absorbing features on an opponent’s aircraft and are immune to electromagnetic jamming, making them valuable alternatives to radars in environments full of hostile electronic warfare assets or stealthy combat aircraft . What GA-ASI has been highlighting with all of these demonstrations is how Avengers, or other loyal wingman-type drones , might be expected to operate networked together with manned fighters to conduct aerial combat missions. The drones would provide increased sensor range and coverage across a broad area for the entire group and their sensor data could be fuzed together with information from other offboard sources to give fighter pilots significantly increased battlespace awareness. This, in turn, would help those pilots to determine the best course of action to prosecute those threats, or even just avoid them. This core concept of operations is not necessarily new and one of the more interesting things to come out of this latest GA-ASI test is a look at an actual interface that pilots could use to control their pilotless wingmen. “The flight demonstrated autonomous collaboration using command and control (C2) of the Avenger from a ruggedized tactical control tablet, integrated with Autonodyne’s RCU-1000 Advanced Human Machine Interface, to provide real-time situational awareness combined with complex behavior tasking,” according to the GA-ASI press release. Autonodyne, the company behind the RCU-1000, describes it as a “ software wrapper ,” effectively an app that provides a visual user-friendly interface to present incoming data from friendly drones and a way to issue various commands, either to an individual unmanned aircraft or networked groups of them. Of course, an aircraft still needs the requisite data links and associated systems to send and receive that information, to begin with. A look at the kind of information and command functionality that the RCU-1000 can present to an operator as provided by GA-ASI. What is visible on the screen is a map of a portion of southern California with various overlays. The green and yellow zones may be “geofences,” or defined boundaries that a semi-autonomous or fully autonomous drone is programmed to stay within during its flight. Also visible toward the bottom is a “wheel” with various control options, including “loiter” and “WPT,” the latter likely standing for “waypoint.”, GA-ASI The video below offers additional examples of the kinds of functionality that came be provided through the RCU-1000. In addition, the RCU-1000 is what is often referred to as ‘platform agnostic,’ meaning that it isn’t designed specifically to control any particular type of drone. Beyond the Avenger, Autonodyne’s website says that the RCU-1000 has been used to operate “literally dozens” of different kinds of drones. The list of examples also includes Kratos’ UTAP-22 Mako, another loyal wingman-type design that the U.S. Navy , and now the U.S. Air Force , has been experimenting with in recent years. The UTAP-22 has notably been the initial platform the Air Force has used to carry systems developed under its Skyborg program . The overall goal is of Skyborg, which GA-ASI is also involved in , is to develop an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain,” and associated systems, that will be capable of flying semi-autonomous loyal wingmen, as well as potentially fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). While GA-ASI’s press release regarding this demonstration involving the Avenger in August did not specifically mention Skyborg, it is not hard to see how the RCU-1000 interface could also be utilized to support that effort. In addition, the RCU-1000 also does not require a specific piece of hardware to run it on. GA-ASI used a version of the software loaded onto a tablet during the August test. This would be a relatively easy way to integrate this control interface, and the loyal wingman capability that comes with it, into various manned fighter jets, as well as other aircraft, on a broad scale, and do so rapidly at low cost. Aviators across the U.S. military, as well as others, already use thigh-mounted tablets for other purposes, so it’s very possible, if not plausible that this control concept could readily leverage existing hardware. Examples of devices that Autonodyne has demonstrated versions of its RCU-1000 software on., Autonodyne Of course, at the same time, with digital, highly customizable touch-screen displays becoming an increasingly common feature in the cockpits in new and upgraded combat aircraft, it is very possible that a peripherical might not be necessary at all to add this functionality into many future fighter designs. As time goes on, more advanced user interfaces may also become available. In the meantime, as GA-ASI, among others, continues to make significant strides in the development of autonomous and semi-autonomous drone technology, there is a growing need for systems that will allow crews of manned aircraft to work directly with these unmanned platforms. A future where fighter pilots have the ability to order around pilotless wingmen using something as simple as a touch-screen tablet on their thigh is quickly becoming a reality.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 6, 2017",Check Out What This Royal Saudi 737 Private Jet Looks Like Inside,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saying something is “fit for royalty” is an often abused talking point for those selling luxury goods, but for one 737 Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) that is currently up for sale, such a claim is totally true. The aircraft up for grabs was built in 1999 and has been adorned in Saudi Arabian flag-bearing liveries for its entire life. However, it does not belong to the Kingdom’s Royal Flight, strictly government-owned and very opulent aircraft, most of which are wide-body Boeing 747s and Airbus A340s, that serve the top rungs of the country’s monarchy. But it’s what’s on the inside that really counts, and advertising images show that this 737 is about as luxurious as it can possibly get. This BBJ may be 22 years old, but it only has 6,602 hours on it, which is a remarkably small amount of usage. The listing over at Controller.com states: Aircraft was completed by Ozark Aircraft Systems in USA in 1999-2000. The interior layout can accommodate 25 VIP passengers and consists of an entrance/vestibule area, forward staff area, forward lounge, main lounge and master stateroom. There are 2 forward galleys, one forward lavatory and one aft lavatory. VQ-BTA in its current livery., via Controller.com While that is an adequate description of the aircraft’s basic layout, it does not do its interior justice. The jet is elaborately adorned in what looks very much like Tiffany Blue with gold accents. Its lavatory bathroom looks more like what you would find in a five-star Parisian hotel than on an aircraft. In fact, its interior design looks remarkably timeless considering it is two decades old and likely cost its own fortune when originally installed. via Controller.com The jet, which carries the Bermuda civil registration code VQ-BTA, has a large Saudi flag on the tail and Arabic nose art that reads: “Al-Mansour,” which translates to “The Victorious.” Not a humble statement for an aircraft that is anything but humble. One unique element that has been displayed on this aircraft in various forms dating back many years is the seal of the Arab Gulf Program For United Nations Development Organizations (AGFUND). Devex.com states the following about AGFUND: The Arab Gulf Program for Development (AGFUND) is a regional organization based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. AGFUND was established in 1980 upon the initiative of His Royal Highness, Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud with the support of leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries: United Arab Emirates, Kingdom of Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, State of Qatar, Sultanate of Oman and the State of Kuwait. AGFUND works mainly in the field of development and growth at the international level through an effective partnership with the United Nations Organization, with regional and national development organizations, with public institutions, with the private sector, as well as with organizations of the civil society. … AGFUND believes in the sustainability of human development and poverty alleviation and struggles to enable vulnerable groups (women and children, people with special needs, displaced people and refugees etc..) to exercise their civil rights in their communities and lead a dignified social and economic existence with improved living conditions. … Through the implementation of its programs, Agfund provides support to needy groups to help facilitate their full access to basic and fundamental social requirements, such as education and health care, under the umbrella of fair national and international legislations towards the prevailing of security and peace. Agfund’s initiated effort to contribute without any discrimination to projects of human development, is done through the support of its Partners and is implemented, by the United Nations Development Organizations, by international and regional organizations, by governmental and NGO’s bodies all over the developing world. Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud was a relatively progressive figure when it comes to the royal elite in Saudi Arabia and remained outspoken on some of the Kingdom’s most controversial issues throughout his life. He passed away in 2018 at 87 years old. One of his sons is now Chairman of AGFUND. So, with this in mind, as well as its prior Saudi Arabian registration HZ-TAA, it’s possible that this was his personal aircraft, or at least it was related to him and his interests in some way. via Controller.com As for what the aircraft is selling for, that isn’t clear, as there is no listed price, but it certainly has a lot to offer despite its age. The newest BBJs based on the 737 Next Gen platform can run around $75M, but that is not with an interior like this, which can cost tens of millions of dollars by itself. So, buying a used, well maintained and equipped aircraft can save massive amounts of money compared to buying new. For instance, this 2001 model with an interior that is nowhere near as elaborate and more total time is selling for around $15M. That is about the same price as a new Citation Latitude midsize business jet , which is downright pedestrian compared to this BBJ. So, if you are in the market for a flying yacht with very low usage and an interior that is truly fit for royalty, check out the original listing on Controller.com and give SM Executive Aviation a ring!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 14, 2021",Jetpacks Will Soon Be Headed To A Military In Southeast Asia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. JetPack Aviation says it secured the first sale of its JB12 jetpack , to an unspecified Southeast Asian military. The company says that it expects to have fulfilled the order, which is for two JB12s at a cost of approximately $800,000, within the next six months. The JB12 is the latest in a line of personal jetpacks available from the California-based firm. JackPack Aviation has not released any pictures or video footage of this particular model, which is described as a “classified” design derived from the earlier JB11 that is specifically intended for military use. The JetPack Aviation JB11 jetpack from which the JB12 is derived., JetPack Aviation The company does say that the JB12 weighs approximately 105 pounds, though it’s unclear if this is an empty weight or with a full load of fuel, either kerosene or diesel. It is powered by six turbojet engines is capable of hitting a speed of around 120 miles per hour. For comparison, the JB11 has an empty weight of 115 pounds and has a maximum speed of over 120 miles per hour, according to JetPack Aviation’s website . The person wearing the JB12 operates the jetpack using a computer-controlled flight system. Among other things, it “can detect an unexpected decrease in thrust from any engine and automatically balance thrust on the opposing engine,” according to an article last year from Vertical magazine . “The ratification of this deal demonstrates that the JB12 JetPack provides defense forces with exceptional aerial capabilities to fulfill a wide array of mission requirements. The maneuverability of the JetPack, its small form factor, which fits inside a set of standard Pelican cases, and ease of integration with our Speeder platform to complement the JB12’s capabilities, were all factors that informed the sale,” JetPack Aviation Founder and CEO David Mayman said in the press release. “This order represents a significant step forward for us as it confirms that our development program is meeting military needs.” Though JetPack Aviation was only founded in 2016, Mayman’s work on developing jet packs goes back to the 1990s . He and others have conducted a number of public demonstrations of earlier models over the years, including a promotional flight around the Statue of Liberty in 2015 using a JB9. Though we don’t know the customer or how they intend to use their JB12s, jetpacks have historically been presented as potentially valuable tools for a host of military missions. At their core, jetpacks, as well as other similar personal mobility systems, such as rocket belts and individual flying platforms , offer a way for even small units to rapidly move from one location to another. In principle, the capabilities jetpacks offer could be potentially useful for limited applications. This could including helping troops quickly reposition in response to changes on the battlefield or rush to the aid of other friendly forces or offering novel ways to quickly conduct boarding operations at sea or execute special operations forces raids . They might have applications in disaster relief and other humanitarian assistance situations, as well, especially given their ability to help personnel get quickly into confined areas that might otherwise be inaccessible. The JB12, however, is hardly the first jetpack design that a military has acquired or otherwise experimented with . The U.S. military, in particular, has looked into jets, rocket belts, flying platforms , and other similar systems on multiple occasions since the 1960s . The videos below show just some of the rocket belts and other concepts for quickly moving individual troops around the battlefield that the U.S. Army explored in the 1960s. In fact, while this new deal is JetPack Aviation’s first actual sale of the JB12, the company did previously secure a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) from the U.S. Navy to work on this design in collaboration with an unspecified U.S. Navy SEAL team on the West Coast. A CRADA is a mechanism available to the U.S. military that allows for collaboration with private companies, research institutions, and other entities, without the need for a standard contract. They often do not even involve any money changing hands, with the deals being more about a sharing of testing capacity and other resources . In August, the U.S. Air Force’s AFWERX technology incubator also selected JetPack Aviation’s Speeder as one of 35 proposals that it will now explore as part of a high-speed vertical take-off and landing (HSVTOL) research and development “challenge,” which you can read more about here . The Speeder is a VTOL-capable vehicle concept that leverages the company’s experience with the JB11, and is intended to either be operated by a single individual or in an unmanned configuration. The Southeast Asian military that has now bought the pair of JB12s has also expressed an interest in the Speeder for various potential missions, “including exfil/infil [exfiltration/infiltration], fire fighting, medical evacuation, cargo deployment into active theatres,” and more, a company spokesperson told The War Zone . Historically, performance and endurance limitations, together with high unit costs, have prevented jet packs from transitioning from more of a novelty into an actual operational military capability. While we don’t know all of the JB12’s specifications, JetPack Aviation says that the JB11 on which it is based has an endurance of around only 10 minutes, which is also “dependent on pilot weight and density altitude.” In a military context, the operator’s total weight would include various weapons and other equipment, even on short-duration missions. At a maximum speed of 120 miles per hour, 10 minutes of endurance would still only give the jetpack a range of around 20 miles, or a combat radius of some 10 miles to and from a launch point. It would certainly be possible to execute one-way, 20-mile flights under certain circumstances, but this would mean the operator could be expected to abandon the system, with its unit cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, at least for a period of time or have to refuel it in the field somehow. There will also be the need for at least some level of special training for any personnel expected to operate these jetpacks. JetPack Aviation has said in the past that it can train people to fly its jetpacks at a basic level in as little as 10 days, but it’s unclear how long the company might feel it would be necessary to train operators to use them on any kind of military missions. All this being said, JetPack Aviation clearly believes that the JB12 offers a path toward turning jetpacks into a viable military capability and at least one military in Southeast Asia has agreed that it is a technology worth pursuing. Hopefully, now that this sale has been announced, will begin to learn more about how the company’s first military customer plans to put its pair of jetpacks to use.

Michael Peck,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Special Operations Command Wants Tiny Cruise Missiles With Hundreds Of Miles Range,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. But is it a missile or a drone? The requirements for the Stand-Off Precision Guided Weapon Program Cruise Missile seem almost contradictory: a cruise missile with long-range, yet tiny enough to fit into a small launch tube. “This system could be used in a broad range of military applications where a long-range weapon must fit in a small space,” noted the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) announcement from U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). More specifically, SOCOM is seeking a precision-guided “cruise missile” with a range of at least 200 nautical miles, and ideally a range of more than 400 nautical miles. This would give SOCOM aircraft, such as AC-130J Ghostrider gunships, the ability to strike targets while remaining safely out of range of hostile air defenses. The missile needs to be capable of carrying, at minimum, a 13-pound warhead, slightly smaller than one found in many Hellfire variants . At the same time, SOCOM says it is interested in designs that might be able to hold payloads weighing up to 37 pounds. A seeker system with electro-optical and infrared modes is also required, but the notice says that SOCOM would be happy to consider designs with additional guidance options, if possible, that allow the weapon “to acquire and/or reacquire targets in flight.” The SBIR notice doesn’t offer examples of what this “multi-mode seeker package” might include, but a millimeter-wave radar homing capability would certainly be one possibility. AC-130 dropping SDB-II Stormbreakers which are equipped with multi-mode seekers., DoD The missile will also need to be networked, at least via Situational Awareness Data Links (SADL), but possibly using Link 16 , as well. SOCOM wants the weapon to have a GPS-assisted Inertial Navigation System (INS) guidance system, as well, with the INS component offering a backup to help it get to the target in environments where GPS jamming is present. Perhaps more important, it would also give U.S. special operations forces a long-range fire capability vastly exceeding the reach of their current short-range Hellfire and Griffin missiles and Small Glide Munition (SGM) glide bombs. The SGM has a range of around 20 miles , or one-tenth of the minimum range of this proposed mini-cruise missile. This new weapon would also out-range the Small Diameter Bombs (SDB) that AC-130s can carry, which have a maximum range of about 50 miles, but likely less at the heights and speeds AC-130s fly at. While the size of the weapon was not specified in the announcement, it must be small enough to be fired from a Common Launch Tube , or CLT. The CLT, from Systima Technologies, is designed to be a universal launcher and storage unit. It can house and fire various small munitions and drones in a launch container just four feet long and seven inches wide, and that can be quickly mounted on a variety of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Griffins and SGMs fit into CLTs, but Hellfires and SDBs won’t. The fact that the SOCOM weapon is designed to fit inside a CLT does raise some questions. How do you cram what would be a long-range weapon inside a relatively tiny launcher? The ‘derringer door’-mounted pressurized launchers and Common Launch Tube rack on a KC-130J Harvest Hawk., Lockheed Martin SOCOM describes this proposed weapon as a cruise missile, which tend to be subsonic weapons that fly at low altitudes to avoid detection. On the other hand, the proposed weapon’s small size and long-range – almost contradictory requirements in munitions design – suggest the possibility of something akin to a loitering munition, which orbits a target like a drone before slamming into it and detonating like a missile. The specification for electric propulsion could suggest a propeller-driven engine. There are emerging mini-cruise missile offerings, such as Spear 3 , but they would not be able to fit in a CLT and have a range of less than half of what is required here. U.S. conventional forces have a wide array of long-range munitions, from Air Force glide bombs to Navy sea-launched cruise missiles, but even small cruise missiles won’t fit inside a CLT. On the other hand, there are long-range drones that can be launched from a CLT. The U.S. military has, interestingly, conducted work in the past involving at least one of these unmanned systems, Raytheon’s Coyote Block 3 , as part of a program called the Low-Cost Cruise Missile (LCCM). Still, these unmanned aircraft don’t necessarily meet the payload requirements SOCOM has outlined here for this new weapon. For example, the Altius 600 drone , another drone that multiple branches of the U.S. military have been experimenting with, has a range of 276 miles and can be fired from CLTs, but can only hold payloads weighing between three and seven pounds, according to the manufacturing. In addition, with a cruise speed of 60 knots and a dash speed of 90 knots, it’s not fast enough to hit time-sensitive targets that could leave the target zone before the missile arrives. Altius-600. , AreaI A SOCOM spokesman declined to comment on the missile project, other than saying that SOCOM is doing a technical analysis of proposals received from industry. The SBIR also announcement makes clear that SOCOM expects “operational prototypes will not be developed” under the first phase of this project. The push for a long-range missile comes after SOCOM has worked to rebuild its missile stockpile depleted from years of unrelenting operations that have strained its personnel and resources. Whatever SOCOM develops, if indeed it finds such a capability technologically feasible, could be adopted by U.S. conventional forces. “I’d be surprised if something like this particular capability wasn’t fairly rapidly adopted by conventional forces, unless it proves to be so expensive or exquisite that it only makes sense to have it as a special capability,” Jonathan Schroden, director of the Special Operations Program at the Center for Naval Analyses think tank, told The War Zone. The SBIR announcement itself says the project Phase II stage of this project would explore whether “This system could be used in a broad range of military applications where a long-range weapon must fit in small space.” If the project is successful, and there is no guarantee that it will be, SOCOM and the rest of the U.S. military will be able to have their cake and eat it too: a missile that’s small, yet still has long-range.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 5, 2021",South Korea Successfully Launches Ballistic Missile From Its New Submarine: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has reportedly conducted successful underwater ejection tests of a ballistic missile from a submarine for the first time. The development and fielding of an indigenous submarine-launched ballistic missile , or SLBM, would place South Korea among a select group of countries with this capability. The test-firing was first reported today by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, with the ejection tests being performed from the first of the Republic of Korea Navy’s Dosan Ahn Changho class diesel-electric attack submarines, each of which has a capacity for six SLBM tubes, although these can also be alternatively loaded with cruise missiles. Some reports suggest that two such tests may have taken place, but there is no official word on the trials, in keeping Seoul’s official policy of secrecy on these matters. As such, there is no word on where the test campaign took place or details about its full scope. The  Hyunmoo 2B short-range ballistic missile, on which the new SLBM is understood to be based., SIPA VIA AP The boat in question, however, was the lead ship of this new class, which was commissioned last month . The Dosan Ahn Changho class is significantly larger than previous South Korean submarines, at around 3,800 tons submerged, and is equipped with a fuel cell-based air-independent propulsion system. The ejection of the SLBM from the submarine follows similar tests using a submerged barge, which The War Zone reported on in July . It’s unclear whether the missile ejected from the submarine completed a full launch cycle, including engine ignition, followed by missile flight, although reports so far only confirm its underwater ejection from the submarine. An earlier launch of an SLBM from a ground test facility also took place at the Anheung test facility late last year . This sequence is also reported by Naval News , citing “an informed source from the defense industry,” who said last week’s test was used, in particular, to demonstrate the reliability of the ‘cold launch’ ejection method, which pops the missile out of its vertical launch tube using compressed air, prior to ignition of the solid-fuel rocket engine. Test-firing of Trident II SLBMs by the USS West Virginia , showing the ‘cold launch’ method: According to Naval News , a third test scheduled for mid-September will complete the development of the new SLBM. This test will confirm the accuracy of the missile, after a ballistic flight over the Anheung test facility, and should pave the way for full-scale missile production and deployment. However, neither the South Korean Ministry of Defense nor the country’s Agency for Defense Development, which is responsible for its defense industry, have so far provided further details of the latest test. However, Yonhap describes the SLBM as the Hyunmoo 4-4, which is sometimes called the K-SLBM, and which was reportedly also involved in the previous test from the submerged barge. The news agency attributes the missile with a range of 311 miles (500km) and suggests it’s a naval variant of the Hyunmoo 2B ballistic missile . https://youtube.com/watch?v=5ut_WWsmlok Since the previous SLBM test involving a submerged barge, the South Korean Ministry of Defense has also revealed more details of its plans for missile development, broadly. Its recently published defense budget proposal for 2022-2026 calls for weapons “with significantly enhanced destructive power” as part of its response to North Korea’s expanding missile capabilities, although it does not make specific mention of SLBMs. Nevertheless, these weapons are being developed against the backdrop of North Korea’s expanding missile arsenal which presents particular risks to ground-based missiles in South Korea. A submarine-launched weapon presents an inherently more survivable option. As well as the SLBM program, South Korea’s renewed focus on ballistic missile development includes land-based weapons, too. Also disclosed in the recent budget proposal was a new ballistic missile capable of carrying a warhead weighing up to three tons, compared to the two tons for the Hyunmoo 4 short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), and with a range of between 220 and 250 miles (350 and 400km). According to reports, this new missile would be tailored to destroy hardened underground sites, including North Korea’s nuclear storage facilities. A still from a video showing a test launch of the Hyunmoo-4 SRBM, currently the largest South Korean ballistic missile., YTN NEWS CAPTURE In all, the budget proposal calls for around $1.3 billion for defense technology research and development over the next year, an increase of 76 percent. These missile projects have been enabled by Seoul having stepped away from the series of restrictions on missile range that had been in place since 1979, under a bilateral agreement with the United States. Most recently, these put a range cap of 500 miles on South Korean missiles. After U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to scrap these limits, South Korea is now able to develop ballistic missiles capable of reaching targets far beyond the Korean Peninsula. President Joe Biden talks during a joint news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in Washington in May., AP Photo/Alex Brandon) If the development of this first-generation South Korean SLBM proceeds successfully, it could be the stepping stone to an altogether more robust conventionally armed ballistic missile deterrent. While the first of the Dosan Ahn Changho class boats are expected to be able to carry six SLBMs, or alternatively cruise missiles, subsequent vessels are expected to have 10 vertical launch silos. There has also been talk of a potential follow-on nuclear-powered submarine design. Ultimately, the removal of the missile restrictions would allow Seoul to field SLBMs with a range greater than 500 miles, too. While developments in North Korea remain the primary concern for South Korea’s policy-makers and war planners, such a capability would also offer deterrence against threats further afield, including China and Russia. Already, South Korea possesses submarine-launched cruise missiles that can attack targets across North Korea, although it could be that the unique attributes of an SLBM are seen as justification for this complex and expensive development effort. Conventionally armed SLBMs would offer South Korea something like a quasi- second-strike capability to help to deter aggression from the north, although such a capability cannot be compared with a true nuclear second-strike capability, in terms of strategic impacts and overall deterrent value. Furthermore, the speed of response and kinetic energy offered by an SLBM could provide an ideal way of attacking a hardened target at short notice, for example decapitating regime command bunkers in the opening phase of a conflict. In general, land-based ballistic missiles already constitute a critical part of South Korea’s response to an attack from the North, and SLBMs would add an additional degree of survivability. Meanwhile, these weapons, regardless of where they are launched from are also much harder to defend against and can carry larger warheads. With that in mind, expanding these types of options would be in keeping with the Republic of Korea’s broader ballistic missile developments. Furthermore, as The War Zone has examined in the past, there remains a possibility that Seoul may eventually seek to add nuclear warheads to its burgeoning ballistic missile force, for which the highly survivable SLBMs would be a prime candidate. North Korean Pukguksong-5 SLBMs on display during a parade in Pyongyang in January. , 朝鮮通信社/AP While the potential for South Korean authorities to pursue this course of action seems remote, at present, it would provide a direct counter to North Korean nuclear capabilities, including SLBMs, although Pyongyang’s efforts to field these onboard operational submarines have so far achieved only limited success . Nuclear-armed South Korean SLBMs would also potentially free the country from its reliance on the United States when it comes to nuclear deterrence and would be a hedge against political winds shifting and the U.S. taking a less direct role in the defense of South Korea. Whatever the long-term plan for South Korea’s still-mysterious SLBMs, the program is making progress and this type of weapon, in particular, would seem to tally with the country’s ambitions to field ever more destructive missiles to help ward off the enduring threat from the North.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 10, 2020",Mystery Flying Wing Aircraft Photographed Over The Philippines (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Philippines sits between the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea, two contentious and highly surveilled bodies of water that regularly see large amounts of military activity, especially Chinese and American. All types of military aircraft constantly frequent the skies above both seas, from bombers to drones, but on September 2nd, at around 6:15 AM local time, landscape photographer Michael Fugnit captured something very unique in his lens—what appears to be a stealthy flying wing aircraft with a diamond-shaped fuselage and slender wings, a centralized exhaust, potentially featuring twin engines, and a ventral fuselage bulge. Fugnit tells The War Zone that he was up early in Santa Magdalena to catch the perfect sunrise when he noticed an aircraft overhead moving along at a good clip. The single image he took showed something that is unlike any normal commercial or military aircraft that usually criss-cross the skies over the region on a daily basis. The original image Michael provided. He states that it was taken by a “Fujifilmxt2 +50-200mm” which, combined with high-altitude and the early morning lighting, would explain the small resolution and grainy nature of the image. , Michael Fugnit We must state that we cannot authenticate the image at this time, although we gave it a cursory examination in photoshop and nothing major stood out. We do not have any reason to believe the photographer fabricated it, either, although it is only prudent to underscore that the factual status of the photograph could change. We will continue to examine the image using various tools and are reaching out to other photo experts to give us their opinion. The location where the image was taken, smack-dab in the middle of two of the most strategic and tense bodies of water in the Pacific Theater. , Google Maps At first glance, the aircraft depicted looks very much like the one seen in the supposed sighting of the so-called RQ-180 Sentinel high-altitude, long-endurance, very low-observable drone from last November. The RQ-180, which you can read our in-depth take on in this past special feature , is thought to be in very limited operation at this time as it continues with its clandestine development. Flying the aircraft in this area of the world would make sense because it is precisely the type of environment it was designed to operate in, but it could also just be transiting to another location, including back to the United States . Also the timing, at sunrise, crossing the last major inhabited area before heading out into the desolate Pacific would make sense. The aircraft is thought to fly out of Area 51 in Nevada and Edwards Air Force Base in California, on extremely long-duration missions, but the isolated island of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, would be another operating location as it expands its operations. Special facilities there can support the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and could likely be used to support the RQ-180, as well. The locale is also known for its use to support clandestine aircraft activities. Andersen Air Force Base on Guam is another potential operating location, but that is likely too high-profile for this stage of the aircraft’s development. Our notional illustration of what the RQ-180 could look like based on publicly disclosed information about very similar concepts from Northrop Grumman that seem to have predated the program. , Hangar B Productions While the aircraft appears to be a good match to what we think the U.S. stealth HALE (high altitude, long endurance) drone known as the RQ-180 looks like, and the timing and location do make some sense, it is not the only possibility. China has a large number of stealthy flying-wing aircraft programs ongoing of all different sizes. Beyond its H-20 stealth bomber program , many stealth drone programs are publically underway , including a concept that is broadly similar to the RQ-180, known as the CH-7 Rainbow . China’s Star Shadow , which has been in development for years, may also have some similarities to the shape we see in the image. Once again, that is one of a number of potential Chinese stealth drones , some of which we know have been in flight testing for years, and there are others that surely remain cloaked in secrecy, that could potentially account for this sighting. A mockup of the CASC CH-7 UCAV at the 2018 Zhuhai airshow., Chinese Internet Because we do not know the approximate altitude the aircraft was flying at, it is possible that this may not have been a strategic platform, it could be something a bit smaller that flies for long periods of time at medium altitudes, instead. Regardless, the appearance of Chinese stealthy drones will become commonplace in the region in the years to come, but this could have been a clandestine operation of one of these systems that has made it at least into an operational testing state. Collecting critical intelligence from a penetrating reconnaissance platform on the countries China has a standing dispute over the South China Sea with does makes sense. As for the possibility that this was China’s H-20 stealth bomber , the chances of that are very low. The aircraft has not been unveiled and is not even thought to be in major flight testing, let alone flying missions over foreign countries. What about a B-2 Spirit transiting the area? The image shows discreet features that are not indicative of the B-2. If the image is legitimate, the chances of it being a B-2 with multiple illusions occurring to make its planform and wing design look very different are quite remote. Also, at least at the time of publishing, radio interceptors and plane trackers have not noticed any B-2s moving through the region. The RQ-170 is another candidate. We know it has been adapted to work in the maritime domain and it has spent time in Asia , but that would be an odd place for it to be and the wings don’t look right. Still, it is a possibility to consider. With that being said, there are two other wrinkles in this story. First, the U.S., U.K., India, Japan, and Australia just held one of their biggest joint exercises ever in the Phillippine Sea. This would have been of the very utmost interest to China. While those activities wrapped up officially by the end of August, assets were likely still in the region when this aircraft was sighted. The same could be true for any Chinese warships movements in the same area, which would be of very high U.S. interest. The South China Sea and the Phillippine Sea, and especially where the two connect , are among the most highly surveilled geographic areas on the planet earth, with dozens of surveillance aircraft, especially from China, the U.S., and other regional stakeholders, working these areas on a daily basis. Now for the final facet to this story, which may or may not be related. Local press in the Phillippines has reported on a scramble of fighters on a mystery, unresponsive aerial contact on the same day and around the same time as when the photo was snapped. Inquirer.net reported the following: The Philippine Air Force (PAF) said Saturday it issued a “scramble order” for two FA-50 Aircraft light fighters to intercept an “unknown aircraft” that approached the Philippine airspace last Thursday. PAF said the Philippine Air Defense Control Center (PADCC) detected an unidentified inbound aircraft in the Philippine Air Defense Identification Zone, approximately 120 nautical miles northwest of Bolinao, Pangasinan. “The unidentified aircraft was heading towards Philippine airspace. Coordination with the CAAP classified it to be an unknown track of interest,” PAF said in a statement. The unknown aircraft was at 21,000 feet flying at 265 knots heading northeast. … “The FA-50s flew at the maximum allowable speed towards the direction of the unknown aircraft. At about 4 minutes into the intercept, the unknown aircraft changed direction towards the North and increased its speed to 400 knots and headed away from the Philippine airspace. The intercept was terminated at 9:45 A.M.,” PAF added. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Maynard Mariano told reporters that the agency could not tell the intent of the aircraft in approaching the country’s area of responsibility. He said there was no radio response from the unknown aircraft. The biggest discrepancy here is the timeframe. This intercept ended some three and a half hours after the image in question was supposedly taken. That doesn’t mean the stealthy aircraft didn’t linger in the area after its picture was taken, as stealthy reconnaissance aircraft are pretty much built to do. The altitude is also too low for a HALE asset, but if the aircraft were a tactical platform, that may be possible. At the same time, a stealth aircraft like this would likely be equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems to help defend itself, so getting a firm altitude, assuming radar actually spotted it at all, may not have been possible. So, we have a very intriguing image and a unique series of events and circumstances that surround it. We wanted to get this up with some basic background and analysis. We will update this piece throughout the day as we can digest the image and work the story more. Finally, we want to underline once again, like any situation like this, it is possible this image is not authentic, so all information must be viewed as preliminary at this time. Let us know what you think in the comments below! UPDATE: It has been a day and a half since this article was published and went viral. Nobody has been able to invalidate the authenticity of the image, including those we asked to take a look at it. This could always change, but that is where it sits as of now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 19, 2021",This Video Of A Red Bull Stunt Pilot Flying Through Two Tunnels Is Absolutely Bonkers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Really grabbing people’s attention with an aerial stunt isn’t as easy as it once was. A lot of what can be done has been done, regulations are tighter than ever surrounding the execution of such feats, and the constant “look at me” dwell of the internet makes doing something truly impressive without killing yourself really tough. Red Bull stunt pilot Dario Costa just overcame this reality and set four world records in the process. And oh was the record-setting flight intense. The 7,400-foot route lasted just over 43 seconds and saw Costa flying his Zivko Edge 540 aerobatic monoplane flat-out through Istanbul’s Catalca Tunnels. Check it out for yourself: https://youtube.com/watch?v=UNyRRHxc0W4 https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYY_9X0j7E Flying through a tunnel clearly presents a load of potentially deadly issues, but flying through two tunnels consecutively really ups the danger. This is from Red Bull’s website explaining exactly what we are seeing in the videos: Surrounded by the concrete arc of the walls, Costa took off in the dim light of the first tunnel at 6:43am local time, with the early hour putting the sun at his back and offering optimal ambient conditions. Limited overhead clearance meant that he had to keep the aircraft on a flight path just above the asphalt while also managing a claustrophobic margin of only about four meters between each wingtip and the unforgiving walls. Changes to airflow, combined with the highly sensitive steering of the aircraft, required reaction times of less than 250 milliseconds as Costa executed fine hand movements of mere millimetres throughout the flight. One of the most critical moments came when the plane flashed through the 360m gap between the tunnels, which exposed the lightweight aircraft to crosswinds as Costa prepared to thread it into the narrow opening of the second tunnel. Costa described, “Everything seemed to be happening so fast, but when I got out of the first tunnel, the plane started to move to the right because of the crosswinds, and in my head, everything slowed down in that moment. I reacted and just focused on getting the plane back on the right path to enter the other tunnel. Then in my mind, everything sped up all over again.” As Costa continued, he was averaging 245km/h while also managing changes in the second tunnel’s incline and shape. When the race plane shot out of the other side, the Italian pulled it into a celebratory loop before landing. … The Tunnel Pass flight was recognised with a Guinness World Record for Longest Tunnel Flown through with an Aeroplane (1,610m), and Costa was presented with the official certificate. The four other notable records were: first aeroplane flight through a tunnel, longest flight under a solid obstacle, first aeroplane flight through two tunnels and first aeroplane takeoff from a tunnel. … In all, the Tunnel Pass project required a team of 40 people, specially developed training technology and more than a year of preparation. “I’d never flown in a tunnel in my life – nobody had ever done it – so there was a big question mark in my head whether everything would go as we expected,” Costa says. “It was a big relief, of course, but big, big happiness was the main emotion. For me, it’s another dream come true.” Amazing work Dario and the Red Bull team!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 1, 2021",Slovak Military Refutes Claim That One Of Their Special Operators Was On One Of The Last C-17s Out Of Kabul,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A lone Slovakian special operator was reportedly one of the very last foreign troops to leave Afghanistan via Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul earlier this week. This individual was among hundreds of people who made their way into the airport after U.S. Army Major General Chris Donahue, the top officer in charge on the ground at the time of the historic departure of the last American troops from the country, made the decision to continue allowing evacuees inside hours after the last open gates were supposed to be sealed. Author’s Note: See the update at the bottom of the story. A Slovak Armed Forces official strongly refutes Jennifer Griffin’s report. Fox News ‘ Jennifer Griffin posted on Twitter yesterday that Donahue, who is also the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division and was the last American service member to climb onboard a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport plane during the final withdrawal, was supposed to have closed all of the gates at a certain time. Instead, he had his troops continue letting people in for almost five more hours after that designated point. Major General Chris Donahue, seen on the radio through a night vision optic, during the final moments of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021., US Army Griffin says that Donahue “was supposed to close gates at midnight Aug 30,” though it’s unclear if this means 12:01 AM local time on Aug. 30 or Aug. 31. If the report is that the general kept the gates open for hours into the morning of the 31st, this would conflict with official statements from the Pentagon that the last U.S. military flight out of Afghanistan left at 11:59 PM on Aug. 30. Regardless, more than 660 people made it into Hamid Karzai International Airport and were subsequently evacuated after Donahue decided to keep the gates open, according to Griffin. These individuals included the following: 29 individuals with U.S. passports (which could include permanent residents who are not citizens) 582 Afghans 36 unspecified “contractors” A NATO staffer 12 individuals affiliated with The New York Times One individual affiliated with the Los Angeles Times One member of Slovakia’s special operations forces (SOF) “According to those involved in [the] operation, he [Donahue] was prepared to take any American who got to Gate up until [the] last C17,” Griffin also wrote. – 1 NATO staffer – 12 NYT employees (afghans somehow affiliated with NyT) – 1 LA Times – 1 Slovakian SOF At 0500, MG Donahue went into the exfill evolution, but according to those involved in operation, he was prepared to take any American who got to Gate up until last C17. — Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) September 2, 2021 All of this is, in many ways, well in line with everything else The War Zone has learned so far about the final days of the evacuations leading up the ultimate withdrawal of the last American troops from Afghanistan this week, which ended nearly two decades of U.S. military presence in the country. Chaos, confusion , and bureaucratic hurdles in getting people to the airport and onto evacuation flights mixed together with ad hoc and sometimes semi-official efforts people to safety seem to have defined the two weeks following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on Aug. 15. Official figures have since emerged that make clear that the U.S. government, for a host of reasons, fell well short of its own goals in terms of how many Americans, other foreigners, and at-risk afghans it had said it wanted to spirit out of the country. In light of all of this, the mention of a single Slovakian special operator being among the very last people to get out on an American military cargo plane has created a certain amount of interest about exactly what this person was doing in Kabul at the very end. The War Zone has already reached out to the Slovakian Ministry of Defense with the hope of getting more specific details. I want the movie version of whatever that one Slovakian SOF trooper was up to… HT @shashj https://t.co/bFPeGICgL3 — Peter W. Singer (@peterwsinger) September 3, 2021 Picture the one Slovakian special forces member wandering around Kabul in the middle of the night, until he hops onto the very last C-17 out of the city. https://t.co/D93zuMkiC1 — Shashank Joshi (@shashj) September 3, 2021 What was a Slovakian SOF doing alone outside the gate on Aug. 30?!? https://t.co/XV7aBBFM6Z — Paul McLeary (@paulmcleary) September 3, 2021 What we have been able to find out already is that a Slovakian “special unit” arrived at Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 28 to execute a rescue mission to save 28 Afghans, according to a story from The Slovak Spectator . This group included six individuals with legal residence permits in Slovakia and members of their families. The story does not name the unit in question, but it seems very likely to have been personnel from one of the Slovakian military’s special operations forces entities. The country’s primary special operations unit is the 5th Special Operations Forces Regiment , personnel from which have been deployed to Afghanistan on multiple occasions over the past decade. A member of Slovakia’s 5th Special Operations Regiment in Afghanistan in 2013., SOCEUR Slovakia, which became an independent country in 1993 after the break up of Czechoslovakia, first deployed troops to the country in 2011. As a member of NATO since 2004, Slovakia’s forces first served under the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which the North Atlantic military bloc led until 2014. Slovakian troops, including special operation forces advisors, continued to deploy to the country after NATO transitioned to the Resolute Support Mission in 2015. The alliance formally ended the Resolute Support Mission on July 12, 2021. Whatever unit provided the personnel for this final evacuation mission, they had been called in to help with the rescue after other plans had fallen through. The Slovakian government had previously organized one evacuation flight of its own, but had attempted to coordinate with its Norwegian counterparts to get this second group of people out of the country. Unfortunately, the Taliban had blocked these Afghans from entering the airport before Norway halted its evacuation effort on Aug. 26, citing the deteriorating security situation on the ground. That day, terrorists from Afghanistan’s branch of ISIS launched a deadly attack outside of the airport in Kabul that killed 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 Afghans, and wounded many more. The subsequent Slovakian rescue mission lasted approximately 80 hours and concluded on Monday. A Slovakian plane brought 14 of the 28 individuals back to that country. The remaining 14 Afghan evacuees rode on a U.S. military aircraft to an unspecified NATO country before then moving onward to Slovakia. Ramstein Air Base in Germany , Naval Air Station (NAS) Sigonella in Italy, and Naval Station Rota in Spain are among the locations that the United States continues to use as intermediate staging facilities for evacuees from Afghanistan before they are moved to more permanent resettlement locations. “The people from the departments of defense, foreign affairs and interior who participated in this operation, worked for several days without a break, using all their strength,” Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger said, according to the country’s state-run TASR news outlet. “Thank you for another successful evacuation from #Afghanistan,” he also wrote on Twitter on Aug. 30. “Operation in extremely difficult conditions resulted into evacuation of 28 #people, who are now safe. Big thanks to the #USA for enormous help and support on the ground.” Thank you for another successful evacuation from #Afghanistan . Operation in extremely difficult conditions resulted into evacuation of 28 #people , who are now safe. Big thanks to the #USA for enormous help and support on the ground. — Eduard Heger (@eduardheger) August 30, 2021 Though we can’t say for certain, it would appear that one individual from this rescue mission stayed behind afterward, possibly to try to get others out of the country. We know that a network of ad hoc groups and individuals , including active and retired American special operators, operating with at least some degree of coordination with the U.S. government, were actively working to help individuals, especially at-risk Afghans, safely to the airport in Kabul over the past two weeks or so. The whole enterprise, largely coordinated using tools online, became dubbed a “ Digital Dunkirk ,” in reference to the famous World War II evacuation operation the British conducted to get troops out of France in 1940. Many of these rescue efforts were a product of personal connections between foreign troops who had served in Afghanistan since 2001 and Afghans they had worked with during those tours of duty. Though we can say one way or the other, it would not be surprising to learn that a Slovakian special operator would be in contact with Afghans they had worked with over the years and would have tried to stay in the country until the very end to help them escape. Afghans who worked with foreign governments, as well as members of former Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, are now at extreme risk of reprisals from the Taliban. Other stories about individuals still trying to find ways to get at-risk Afghans out of the country continue to emerge, as well. A former British Army military policeman, Ben Slater, who runs a non-governmental organization called Nomad Concepts Group, was arrested and then released by the Taliban yesterday after trying to get a group of individuals out through an unspecified border station. He had previously said he had been able to get 67 other people safely out of Afghanistan . Markwayne Mullin, a Republican Representative in Congress from Oklahoma, resurfaced earlier this week after effectively disappearing on his own unofficial rescue mission to the region. Mullin had reportedly been seeking to bring a large amount of cash into neighboring Tajikistan, where he planned to charter a helicopter to fly across the border into Afghanistan. “I am heading home… Have we been helping get Americans out of Afghanistan, yes. Is the mission continuing, yes. Am I missing, no,” he wrote in a post on Instagram on Wednesday. “Am I extremely disappointed in how we (United States) left Americans behind… that would be an understatement.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Markwayne Mullin (@markwaynemullin) Of course, there could be other reasons why the Slovakian special operator was still in Kabul as the last American planes were preparing to leave this week. Hopefully, we will be able to get more details in the future about this particular story. UPDATE: A Slovak Armed Forces public affairs officer strongly refutes the report, stating, in part: “The only true part is that our military evacuation plane with small SOF detachement were there on that day, being probably the last succesful evacuation effort by any other Allied nation excluding US. And, yes, we were succesfull to bring back 28 of our citizens and other affiliated personnel.” So it would seem that they do not agree with the report that the last U.S. flights out of Kabul included a single special operator from their forces. We will continue to update this story as we learn more. UPDATE: The War Zone also reached out to U.S. Central Command for additional clarification on this story. CENTCOM’s public affairs office declined to comment at all and directed us to remarks that U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of the command, had made about the evacuation operations and final withdrawal on Aug. 30. McKenzie did not make any specific mention of this particular situation, though he did laud “the flexibility and the professionalism of the men and women of the U.S. military and our coalition partners who were able to rapidly combine efforts and evacuate so many under such difficult conditions.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air C-17 Transports"

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 13, 2022",This “Ghost Fleet” Ship Firing An SM-6 Missile From A Modular Launcher Is A Glimpse Of The Future,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Department of Defense has just given us our first glimpse of what will likely be a common sight in the futureâ€”smaller ships, some of which will be unmanned or minimally manned, sporting modular launchers capable of firing the most advanced standoff weapons in the inventory. In this case, the launcher shown was used to fire an SM-6 missile , which is quickly becoming one of the most relevant and flexible weapons in the Pentagon’s entire arsenal.Â The DoD posted a video of the Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) Ranger testing a containerized four-pack SM-6 launcher. Ranger is an experimental vessel that is part of the service’s Ghost Fleet Overlord program aimed at defining unmanned warship capabilities and their concepts of operations, which you can read more about in this past piece of ours. USV Ranger with the launcher and communications systems on its payload deck., US Navy Video Screencap SM-6 is capable of swatting down air-breathing threats, such as fixed-wing planes, helicopters, and cruise missiles, while also being able to intercept ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight. In addition, SM-6 also has a secondary strike capability, and is able to hit fixed targets on land and moving targets, such as ships, at sea with great precision over long ranges. Its high-speed and quasi-ballistic missile mode of attack makes it hard to defend against. The type is also being developed as potentially a key component of future hypersonic weapons defense architecture.Â See the game-changing, cross-domain, cross-service concepts the Strategic Capabilities Office and @USNavy are rapidly developing: an SM-6 launched from a modular launcher off of USV Ranger. Such innovation drives the future of joint capabilities. #DoDInnovates pic.twitter.com/yCG57lFcNW — Department of Defense ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@DeptofDefense) September 3, 2021 The U.S. Army is now also pursuing the SM-6 , which is slated to get a big leap in performance in its next-generation form, as well. The U.S. Army will employ SM-6 on land, primarily against land targets , but it could also potentially be used as a networked interceptor to counter aerial, hypersonic, and ballistic missile threats, as well as in an anti-ship role.Â With this in mind, and considering the weapon’s networking capabilities, deploying it aboard ships in a containerized manner is a no-brainer. Working essentially as distributed weapons platforms , these ships could spread out over great distances and launch on targets remotely with cueing from off-platform sensors arranged throughout the battlespace, such as on major surface combatants, fighter aircraft, airborne sensor aircraft, space satellites, and much more. Networked weapons concepts like thisâ€”where they do not have to rely on targeting from their launch platformâ€”will enable the Pentagon’s future “kill-web” that will range over thousands, not hundreds, of miles. SM-6 launch from a cruiser’s Mk4 41 VLS, USN The launcher could have larger implications itself. It is probable, not just possible, that it could launch other weapons that are compatible with the Navy’s Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS), as well as possibly others. Even if it could just also handle BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, it would provide incredible flexibility that can be deployed virtually anywhere. This includes on the ground. In fact, this could have direct commonality with the launcher the Army envisions for both the SM-6 and the Tomahawk.Â The launcher seen aboard Ranger in the Navy’s new video., Twitter Screencap/USN video In fact, the launcher seen in the Navy’s video appears to be the same one, or at least a very close evolutionary cousin of, the modular four-cell launcher we have recently seen associated with the updated land-based Tomahawk. It was used to execute the first land-launched Tomahawk test since the end of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. You can read all about that test and the launcher in this article of ours. Good visit to @LockheedMartin with the Strategic Capabilities Office to see critical new capabilities under rapid development. This will help ensure the U.S. and our allies in Europe & Asia are able to defend against aggression #PeaceThroughStrength pic.twitter.com/NDz2dffwCr — USArmsControl (@USArmsControl) August 14, 2020 Land-based Tomahawk test from a modular four-cell launcher shortly after the end of the INF treaty. , DoD In the naval domain alone, such a modular system, along with communications needed to connect to networks that are tied to command and control elements, could be deployed on pretty much any ship. That includes potential unmanned assets, as well as existing manned ones, like support and replenishment ships. This is a concept that the Navy has been eyeing for some time . The Navy’s forthcoming smaller ships designed specifically to support U.S. Marines’ distributed operations could also field such a containerized system. Even commercial vessels could be quickly drafted into the role as distributed weapons nodes during a conflict.Â Finally, the Coast Guard could leverage such a concept for its future icebreakers which will face an increasingly contested environment in the Arctic . Deploying such containerized systems is already something the Coast Guard is mulling over for these new vessels.Â The bottom line here is that this little video is certainly a glimpse of what’s to come. As the Navy continues to wrestle with the vast operational, tactical, and strategic challenges that the Pacific Theater, in particular, represents, moving to a highly distributed and platform-diversified combat strategy won’t just be advantageous, it will be essential . This new launcher, and the further leveraging of the SM-6, as well as distributing these capabilities across what will be the truly massive battlefields of the future, are absolutely key components in preparing for this new reality in modern warfare.
